<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Eye Final Four -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- When talking about women's basketball at  
Tennessee, get the numbers right. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw was asked Friday about the possibility of a  
third straight national title. The All-American shot back with a 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I would be winning my fourth,'' she said. ``I've won  
three already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, top-seeded Tennessee (30-2) is deep into the NCAA  
tournament, primed for its 12th Final Four trip since 1982 and 
fifth title of the 1990s. The next step is the East Regional 
semifinals Saturday against Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're at the top of our game -- Tennessee wins,'' coach Pat  
Summitt said when asked about the possibility of a Virginia Tech 
(28-2) upset Saturday. ``If we bring our `A' game then we're going 
to be a hard team to beat in March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech coach Bonnie Henrickson has built a solid program  
in her two seasons in Blacksburg, Va., including a school-record 
28-2 mark this season, but nothing to compare to Tennessee's 
dominance and Summitt's 694 career wins. 
</P>
<P>
	And Henrickson didn't hide the fact -- in front of three of her  
best players -- that the Lady Volunteers are more talented at every 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that we have to play a perfect game, there is no  
such thing,'' Henrickson said. ``We've got to limit our mistakes. 
It's how we respond. Do we still have poise and composure to do the 
little things and stay together? 
</P>
<P>
	``This team all year has had great confidence in each other.  
They realize that 1-on-1 we're overmatched at each position, but we 
haven't let it go 1-on-1 all year, we don't play that way. We rely 
on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The health of Tennessee guard Semeka Randall remains  
questionable. She damaged a ligament in her left ankle in the first 
round and missed her team's 89-62 second-round victory over Boston 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	``If practice is any indication, I think she'll be available,''  
Summitt said of Randall, who averages 14.1 points and 5.1 rebounds 
a game. ``She plays at one speed -- all out. I had to tell her to 
slow down in ballhandling drills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, minutes later, Summitt backed off her comments and said  
she may wait until halftime before deciding on whether to use 
Randall. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's first semifinal, Duke (26-6) takes on Old Dominion  
(28-3). 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils won the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season  
with a 15-1 record. The Lady Monarchs are one of the game's storied 
women's programs, having won eight straight Colonial Athletic 
Association crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion is a deep team with interchangeable parts that  
pressured its first two NCAA opponents into 62 combined turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name of the game is not necessarily going to be scoring,  
but taking care of the ball to allow us to score,'' Duke coach Gail 
Goestenkors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Monarchs are riding a 17-game winning streak, last  
losing on Jan. 19 to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion's fine season has come despite losing All-Americans  
Ticha Penicheiro and Nyree Roberts to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last season we heard how the era had ended,'' coach  
Wendy Larry said. ``As a coach and as a player when you hear that 
over and over again you can get very inspired. Thank goodness for 
our inspiration.''

<HEADLINE> Libya Turns Over Pan Am Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Libya took a key step Friday toward ridding  
itself of U.N. sanctions by agreeing to turn over by April 6 two 
men wanted for trial on charges of blowing up a Pan Am jetliner 
over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement -- delivered by South African President Nelson  
Mandela, who has been pressing to resolve the deadlock -- was the 
first time Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has set a date for 
the handover. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,  
killed 270 people. The U.N. imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 for 
refusing to hand over the two men for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela reported the deal to Libyan politicians in Tripoli, the  
Libyan capital, as Gadhafi looked on. The speech was broadcast by 
Libyan television and monitored in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya has agreed to ``ensure that the two suspects would be  
available for (U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan) to take custody 
of them on or before 6 April, 1999'' for their trial in the 
Netherlands, Mandela said, quoting from a Libyan letter sent to 
Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi has agreed to a trial in the past but always with  
conditions that prolonged the deadlock. However, the latest deal 
has a good chance, given that Gadhafi has involved a statesman like 
Mandela, a longtime ally whom he respects highly. King Fahd of 
Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. ally, also lent his support to efforts 
to find a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan is ``looking  
forward'' to receiving details of the agreement. Annan was 
scheduled to meet Libya's U.N. Ambassador Abuzed Omar Dorda late 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But Susan Cohen, the mother of a Lockerbie victim, was skeptical  
of Gadhafi's promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been down this road so often,'' said Cohen, whose  
20-year-old daughter Theodora was on Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is another go-round and (the suspects) still have  
not appeared. They are not in the Netherlands,'' Cohen, of Cape May 
Courthouse, N.J., said in telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi said in an earlier speech that if it wasn't for South  
Africa and Saudi Arabia, the conflict ``would have gone till 
doomsday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have called on the Libyan people to continue the  
confrontation ... but we have accepted'' because of Mandela and 
King Fahd, Gadhafi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992, intended to make  
it hand over the suspects -- intelligence agents Abdel Basset Ali 
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- for trial in Britain or the 
United States. Libya has resisted, saying they would not get a fair 
trial in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi agreed in principle last year to having the men tried by  
a Scottish court in the Netherlands but objected to the possibility 
of imprisoning the suspects in the West if they were convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Libya has agreed that the suspects would serve any possible  
prison sentence in Scotland under U.N. supervision, Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya's concerns about the sanctions also have been allayed.  
Under the deal, the sanctions will be frozen when the suspects 
arrive in the Netherlands. They will be lifted fully when Annan 
submits a report within 90 days certifying that Libya has met 
Security Council requirements, Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions prohibit air travel to and from Libya, limit  
diplomatic contacts and ban the sale of oil industry spare parts to 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook welcomed the news but said:  
``We will not drop our guard until the two men land in the 
Netherlands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It will all have been worth it if we can secure a trial that  
brings out into the open the facts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Burleigh, the deputy U.S. ambassador at the United  
Nations, also was cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been looking for a date. But more important than the  
date is the actual turnover. This is the key, and this is what is 
required,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain had threatened more sanctions if  
Libya hadn't resolved the deadlock by March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Gadhafi said after the handover, the United States must present  
for trial the military personnel who carried out a 1986 air raid on 
his house, an attack in which his adopted daughter was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to be surrendered to Libya for trial in a third  
country,'' he said, calling for U.N. sanctions against the United 
States if it refuses.

<HEADLINE> W.V. Man Suing Penthouse for $3M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A man is suing Penthouse magazine for  
$3 million, alleging the magazine robbed his 13-year-old son of his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barefield of Dunbar filed the lawsuit Wednesday, saying  
his son was solicited by Penthouse and other adult magazines to 
subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how they got his name or how they signed him up.  
It's just amazing to me,'' Barefield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barefield contacted the state attorney general and got an  
apology from Penthouse after school officials confiscated a duffle 
bag full of magazines from his son in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's fine that they apologized and stopped sending the  
magazines, but that's not enough,'' he said. ``They shouldn't be 
allowed to get away with sending this stuff to kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Penthouse in New York late Friday were not immediately  
returned.

<HEADLINE> Investigation at Crash Site Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators began wrapping up  
their work at the site of a deadly train-truck accident today, and 
the question of when the truck driver entered the track crossing 
remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by National Transportation Safety Board  
investigator J.S. Dunn said ``a number of people'' claiming to have 
witnessed the crash that killed 11 had come forward and that their 
stories would be checked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any characterization of witness statements up to this point  
would be one person's interpretation and not the position of the 
Safety Board,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal sources told The Associated Press that the first witness  
to come forward said he saw the truck loaded with steel enter a 
railroad crossing despite flashing warning lights just before it 
was struck by an onrushing Amtrak passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the AP had reported that the witness had said that  
the truck driver tried to snake through lowered crossing gates and 
beat the train. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an NTSB source said language problems made it unclear  
if the Spanish-speaking witness said the crossing's gates were down 
at the time the truck entered. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson,  
said the engineer of the City of New Orleans train claimed the 
truck driver tried to zigzag his tractor-trailer through the 
crossing gates after they had come down. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB member John Goglia said a full statement from the engineer  
will have to wait, since he is sedated and still shaken by the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-car train slammed into the truck loaded with steel rods  
at 79 mph in a rural crossing 50 miles south of Chicago on Monday. 
All of those killed in the fiery wreck were found in a sleeper car 
that was badly damaged by one of the engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucker John Stokes, 58, reportedly said he couldn't see the  
train coming and the gates were up when he entered the crossing. 
Stokes has retained an attorney and future communications must be 
through the lawyer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have confirmed a criminal investigation is under  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	A brother and sister whose mother -- Marie Munson, 64 -- is  
believed to have died in the crash visited the site Friday and 
urged the truck driver to say publicly what happened. Munson is not 
on the partial list of official victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he ran the gates and they were down, I'd like for him to  
come out and admit it,'' Robert Munson said. ``If he did do it, 
have the common decency to admit it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany Munson said their mother was en route to New Orleans to  
visit relatives and originally bought a coach ticket, then upgraded 
it to a berth on the ill-fated sleeper car. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was scared to death of flying'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Numbers Like Duke's Don't Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A team that has an advantage in  
almost every area doesn't need any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Duke has one.  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils have national bests of 93.6 points per game and  
a 26.3 average margin of victory, a 51.7 shooting percentage that 
ranks No. 2 in the country, a school-record 29-game winning streak 
and two NCAA tournament games they won by an average of 41 points. 
What other edge can they have as they head into tonight's East 
Regional semifinal against Southwest Missouri State? 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is 13-1 in Continental Airlines Arena, and four of those  
wins have sent the Blue Devils on to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	That means 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State has to play Duke  
in a building where the Blue Devils have a better winning 
percentage than they do at Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about not being in awe,'' Bears coach Steve Alford said.  
``What we've tried to do over the last four days is diminish the 
awe a little bit as each day passes. Because if we're in awe at 
7:35, by 7:45, like a lot of other teams this year, it's going to 
be over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (34-1) has won its last 11 games by an average of 31  
points, and since Feb. 11, only one team has been within 20 points 
at game's end. That was North Carolina State, which lost by 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of 35 games, there have been probably 30 games where a  
team has, I don't want to say quit, but you know it's over,'' Duke 
forward Chris Carrawell said. ``A couple of teams we played, they'd 
just start talking to us: `You guys are really good.' It's a 
conversation now. We're buddies because the game is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri State (22-10), which has won its NCAA  
tournament games by a combined 41 points, has to make sure it 
doesn't get started in this reverse trash-talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're a great team, they've been a great team all  
year, the No. 1 team in the polls,'' Bears junior guard Kevin Ault 
said. ``We just have to put all that behind us. There are 16 teams 
left in the country and we're one of them, and we have to play that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke center Elton Brand, the only unanimous AP All-American,  
isn't concerned he and his teammates could get caught up hearing 
about how great they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach has instilled the will to win in us, to play our hardest  
every time out,'' Brand said of Mike Krzyzewski. ``We don't look at 
the name of the team we're playing. As long as Duke's playing, 
we're out there to play our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski needs two wins to tie John Wooden for second place on  
the career NCAA tournament victory list at 47, 18 behind Dean 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford has two wins in the NCAA tournament -- the ones over  
fifth-seeded Wisconsin and fourth-seeded Tennessee last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team doesn't have the fortune of being led by a coach  
who's been there and done that,'' Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski was asked which is tougher: bringing in a heavy  
favorite or leading the underdog with nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the coach in each particular situation will tell you  
that situation is the hardest,'' he said. ``I'd rather be in the 
situation I'm in. I have a really good basketball team. I respect 
the team we're playing. I'd rather get my team ready to play 
Southwest Missouri State than switch roles with Steve Alford. I 
don't know which is harder, but I'll take the one I'm in.''

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Patch for Shingles Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diana Hind was bedridden with pain from  
shingles. Even narcotic painkillers didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
	So her husband, a retired pharmaceutical chemist, mixed a  
different painkiller in his laboratory. Now the LidoDerm patch not 
only has 80-year-old Mrs. Hind back on her feet; today, the Food 
and Drug Administration approved its sale for up to 200,000 
sufferers of shingles-caused pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The hand-sized, drug-filled patch has evolved a bit since Harry  
W. Hind stuck his homemade salve onto his wife's back with Saran 
Wrap and tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to make a more elegant way of doing this,'' Hind, 83,  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hind added: ``You know, socially you can't go out with  
Saran Wrap around you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at the time, she didn't mind the mess. ``I could not have  
gone on with that pain. There's no question about that,'' the San 
Jose, Calif., woman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shingles is a risk to anyone who has ever had chickenpox. The  
chickenpox virus, called herpes zoster, hibernates inside the body. 
As people age, the immune system wanes and herpes zoster can 
reactivate, causing painful shingles. Most people recover in a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	But for up to 20 percent of patients, shingles can damage nerves  
in the skin and cause severe, unrelenting pain for months or even 
years. Narcotic painkillers and a few other drugs offer some relief 
for this ``postherpatic neuralgia,'' but they all cause serious 
side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Hind was stricken in 1989, a University of California,  
San Francisco, doctor gave her just-under-the-skin injections once 
a week of the anesthetic lidocaine. The series of shots, every 
half-inch across her back, took 45 minutes and provided about six 
hours of pain relief. The injections had to be performed carefully, 
because lidocaine that penetrates to the bloodstream also can cause 
serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaker versions of topical lidocaine numb the skin's surface,  
but they don't penetrate to the nerves and so don't help 
postherpatic neuralgia, said Dr. Bradley Galer of Beth Israel 
Medical Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	So Hind, who had run a company for years that developed eye and  
skin drugs, revamped lidocaine to penetrate into the skin, just to 
the nerves, without all those injections. He slathered his new 
solution onto his wife's back and taped Saran Wrap over it to keep 
the goop in place overnight. The next morning, Mrs. Hind says, she 
was without pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Hind's 5 percent lidocaine solution in a  
less-messy form Friday, the LidoDerm patch. In studies, 60 to 70 
percent of patients got pain relief from LidoDerm, said Galer, who 
helped study the patch. Some patients need new patches daily. With 
others, a single patch lasts a few days or a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big beauty of this ... is there are absolutely no systemic  
side effects,'' Galer said. ``Within a week, most people know if it 
works or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA did warn that lidocaine occasionally causes dangerous  
allergic reactions and skin reddening or irritation. Also, patients 
must dispose of used patches carefully, because they contain 
lidocaine that could be dangerous if a pet or child ate it. 
</P>
<P>
	Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Chadds Ford, Penn., will sell the  
patch beginning in September. A price has not been set.

<HEADLINE> China Tries To Save Investment Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Seeking to avoid the collapse of another major  
Chinese financial institution, authorities pledged steps Friday to 
restructure the debt and assets of a southern city's flagship 
investment arm. 
</P>
<P>
	State television said Guangzhou International Trust and  
Investment Corp., or GZITIC, will ``very soon'' repay money owed to 
all creditors. The report gave neither details of a rescue plan nor 
a timetable for repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of the fast-growing city of Guangzhou formed the  
company in 1984 as a non-banking financial institution to draw 
capital and investment for government projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Guangzhou government doesn't wish for GZITIC to go  
bankrupt, but rather to go through restructuring,'' the brief 
television report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally broadcast statement follows a meeting Wednesday  
between Guangzhou government officials in which GZITIC's 
liabilities were discussed along with options for trying to meet 
payment obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Several bankers who also attended a GZITIC creditors' meeting in  
the southern city said officials also demanded the withdrawal of a 
liquidation petition filed in Hong Kong against a GZITIC arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem of GZITIC is that it's being pushed by others,'' a  
spokesman for the Guangzhou government told Dow Jones Newswires on 
Friday. ``If it's given a break, it would be able to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another official in the Guangzhou Development Planning  
Commission said the government doesn't yet have a detailed plan to 
restructure and revive the troubled investment unit. 
</P>
<P>
	GZITIC's problems came to light in October, just days after  
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp., the provincial 
government's investment arm, revealed it couldn't pay its debts. On 
Oct. 16, Societe Generale S.A. of France said GZITIC had defaulted 
on a $30 million syndicated loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong Vice Governor Wang Qishan said in an interview earlier  
this month that GZITIC could avoid bankruptcy, unlike its 
provincial counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangzhou officials have previously said GZITIC's  
foreign-currency debt amounts to $700 million, but bankers say that 
figure will probably climb much higher once a full accounting is 
completed.

<HEADLINE> Newseum on Wheels To Hit Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man who once launched a search for  
America's mood and later founded a museum dedicated to the news is 
combining the two ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen H. Neuharth, former chairman of Gannett Co. Inc. and  
founder of the Freedom Forum, is hitting the road with 
``NewsCapade,'' a traveling version of the Arlington, Va., Newseum, 
which will make stops in all 50 states during the next two years. 
The journey comes 12 years after Neuharth set off on ``BusCapade 
USA,'' a six-month tour in which he reported on the mood of America 
for USA Today and other Gannett newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The traveling museum features historical front pages, exposes on  
journalism ethics and interactive computers that allow visitors to 
try their hands at being an editor, a photographer or a television 
reporter doing a stand-up in front of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuharth told a news conference Thursday that he will be  
``spreading the First Amendment Gospel'' to ``everyday people'' 
across the country, and in doing so explain how the news is made. 
</P>
<P>
	Transported by two royal blue tractor-trailers that connect and  
transform into a 2,000-square-foot exhibition space, NewsCapade 
includes a short film that pays homage to nearly 150 years of 
journalism and a few captured moments of history -- including Walter 
Cronkite's announcement of President Kennedy's death, film of 
police attacking freedom marchers from the civil rights movement 
and Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures, film and video are among the most powerful parts of  
the show: a child prisoner at a Nazi concentration camp bearing the 
numbered tattoo on his forearm, soldiers and battles from the Civil 
War through the Gulf War, peace treaty handshakes on the White 
House lawn, hijackings, cheering crowds chipping away at the Berlin 
Wall, the likes of Frank Sinatra, James Dean and Lucille Ball in 
bold black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	In the main exhibition room, a bank of televisions continually  
portray network coverage of more recent breaking stories: the 
immediate aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, police chasing 
O.J. Simpson down the freeways of Los Angeles, the erratic camera 
movements showing the 1981 assassination attempt on President 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission to NewsCapade will be free. The first stop is April 13  
in San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Seeks Cut in Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson could soon have his wish to get  
out of jail and into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion has requested that his one-year  
sentence on assault charges be reduced to eight months, and a 
hearing is set for March 26 at the Montgomery County District 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could literally be a free man shortly thereafter,'' said  
Robert Greenberg, one of Tyson's two lawyers in the Maryland case. 
He said Tyson will not attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, jailed since Feb. 5 on charges he assaulted two motorists  
after a minor traffic accident last August, would not have been 
eligible for early release until July under his imposed sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Judge Stephen Johnson approves the motion, he could be  
eligible that afternoon, said Eric Seleznow, a spokesman for the 
county's Department of Correction and Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	In such cases, once the judge rules, corrections officials  
evaluate each inmate to determine whether he is ready for early 
release, Seleznow said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Seleznow added, ``I don't want (people) to think just  
because the judge cuts his time, he's going to be going right 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disciplinary problems are taken into consideration. Last month,  
Tyson tossed a TV set. Seleznow said the 32-year-old boxer has not 
had any substantial problems since. 
</P>
<P>
	All eligible inmates also must undergo a two-hour screening in  
which officials gauge their level of commitment to treatment, 
establish rehabilitation and work goals and determine counseling 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Seleznow would not estimate when Tyson might meet those and  
other requirements that could free him from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could potentially go in three days or he could go months  
later,'' Seleznow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, however, probably will not follow the normal prerelease  
track in which inmates are sent first to a halfway-house and then 
to home electronic monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There would be problems with the crowds and media attention at  
the open facility,'' Seleznow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Tyson probably would be placed directly on electronic  
monitoring at the Bethesda, Md., home he shares with his wife, 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson likely would be permitted to train during the day,  
required to submit urinalysis samples and undergo extensive therapy 
with his personal psychiatrist and a jail-appointed counselor, 
Seleznow said. 
</P>
<P>
	He could complete such court-ordered monitoring by September,  
depending on his conduct and whether the judge agrees to reduce his 
sentence, said Russ Hamill, acting director of the Department of 
Correction and Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamill said that schedule would include the 60-day sentence  
Indiana has imposed for violating his probation on a 1992 rape 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson would then have to complete two years of supervised  
probation.

<HEADLINE> Differing Opinions on Derivatrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
says financial institutions should be given more incentives to 
better assess the risk of derivatives, but suggested greater 
government oversight is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks today were in direct contrast to those of  
the outgoing chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 
Brooksley Born, who argued a day earlier that more regulation is 
necessary to prevent a systemic collapse that could affect the U.S. 
and world economies. Both addressed a commodies industry 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Derivatives are often-complex investments that are linked -- or  
derived from -- an underlying asset such as a currency, bond or 
commodity. For example, banks and investors might trade a 
derivative linked to the interest earned on a $100 million bond 
without trading the bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The global derivatives market last year was linked to assets  
with an estimated value of $70 trillion, ``a figure that doubtless 
is closer to $80 trillion this year,'' said Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far the most significant event in finance in the past  
decade has been the extraordinary development and expansion of 
financial derivatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking via satellite, said the free-market approach  
appears most adequate in determining exposure in the rapidly 
growing market despite heavy volatility in the second half of last 
year that shook world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we approach the 21st century, both banks and nonbanks need  
to continually reassess whether their risk-management practices 
have kept pace with their own evolving activities and with changes 
in financial market dynamics, and readjust accordingly,'' he said. 
``Should they succeed, I am quite confident that market 
participants will continue to increase their reliance on 
derivatives to unbundle risks and thereby enhance the process of 
wealth creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the near-collapse last year of Long-Term Capital  
Management L.P., a hedge fund which held derivatives tied to more 
than $1 trillion in assets, some regulators and politicians have 
called for greater government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	But while lenders suffered record losses in the third quarter of  
1998, chiefly as a result of the collapse of Russia's currency, the 
losses still were well below those suffered by banks on standard 
loans, Greenspan said. And U.S. bank exposure to derivatives last 
year represented $325 billion, or only about 6 percent of their 
total assets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. commercial banks hold about 25 percent of the derivative  
contracts worldwide and U.S. securities houses an additional 15 
percent, according to said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said derivative markets outside formal commodity  
exchanges are functioning effectively without CFTC oversight, 
providing ``a strong argument for development of a less-burdensome 
regime for exchange-traded financial derivatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Greenspan said many banks have not prepared for the  
worst-case scenario in which investors panic, being content to rely 
now on merely meeting minimum government requirements for capital. 
The risk of potential future exposure during a sudden and 
precipitous downturn must be better-addressed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks were welcome news for the industry. Futures  
exchanges have argued they face regulations that are far more 
stringent that over-the-counter markets, leading to lost business. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, of the $37 trillion in assets linked to the U.S. market  
for derivatives at the end of last year, $4 trillion was 
represented by exchange-traded contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress this year will begin rewriting the Commodities Exchange  
Act, and futures exchanges are hoping lawmakers will sharply relax 
rules that govern them.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Higher; Grains Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices were higher and grains  
were mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices jumped in choppy trading this morning,  
boosted by rumors of reduced crop estimates out of Brazil. Gains 
were limited, however, by uncertainty over those figures and the 
fact this will be a harvesting weekend in Brazil, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat was pressured by rainfall in parts of the central United  
States, where the hard red winter wheat crop is considered in good 
condition already. Wheat futures had fallen sharply Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also news that the Chinese wheat belt has received  
beneficial precipitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures rose on rumors that a credit line allowing South  
Korea to purchase more corn could be approved next week. Gains were 
limited on news that China is getting more aggressive in offering 
corn for export. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn finished lower Thursday despite hitting 9 1/2-week highs  
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 1/4 cent to $2.74 a bushel; May corn  
was up 1 cent to $2.25 1/4 a bushel; May oats were up 1/4 cent to $1.11 1/4 
a bushel; May soybeans were up 2 3/4 cents to $4.84 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, as were lean hogs and pork bellies. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures fell 0.48 cent to 66.67 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle were off .35 cent to 71.65 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs were off .02 cent to 42.25 cents a pound; and May 
pork bellies were off .40 cent to 50.50 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Miami, Ohio Has Daunting Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This time, Miami of Ohio gets a chance to  
eliminate the other half of last season's NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, the prospect of taking on defending  
champion Kentucky in the Midwest Regional semifinals would be 
daunting. But after knocking off Utah, the No. 2 seed, the 
10th-seeded Mid-American Conference champions aren't exactly in awe 
of tonight's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad's always said this: Every game starts at zero and each  
team has the same opportunity to win,'' Miami star Wally Szczerbiak 
said. ``The aura Kentucky has, it's really no different from the 
aura Utah had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not this year, considering that Kentucky (27-8) is the No.  
3 seed. But don't forget to factor in the rich tournament heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats have been in the national title game the last three  
years. They've been to 40 NCAA tournaments, more than any other 
team, and this is their fifth straight appearance in the round of 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact we've been here and been so successful gives us  
confidence,'' forward Scott Padgett said. ``At this time of the 
year, we know what it takes to win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky also has won 17 in a row against Miami, with the last  
loss in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kentucky expects to get at least this far every year,  
Miami (24-7) is hitting a rare high note. Coach Charlie Coles' team 
has tied the school record for victories, is in the round of 16 for 
the first time since 1978 and has never made it to the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said somebody has made a big mistake if he and Kentucky  
coach Tubby Smith ever end up in the same place checking out 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never really cross paths,'' Coles said. ``If I see Tubby  
out recruiting someone, then I'm in the wrong gym. Nothing against 
our players, but that's just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That even goes for Szczerbiak, the tournament darling and likely  
NBA lottery pick who has 67 points in Miami's first two NCAA 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't recruited by Kentucky at all,'' said Szczerbiak, who  
averages 24.3 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith isn't to blame, since this is his second season with the  
Wildcats. Still, it made him wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are a lot of great players who've fallen  
through,'' Smith said. ``It can happen. But in this day, it's hard 
to imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak carried Miami in the tourney-opening victory over  
seventh-seeded Washington, scoring 43 of the team's 59 points. 
Miami proved it's not a one-man team against Utah, winning 66-58 
even though Szczerbiak was held to 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against Utah, I don't think I had a superhuman effort,''  
Szczerbiak said. ``Other guys stepped up and did the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami likely will need more performances like John Estick's  
season-best 18 points against Utah against a Kentucky team known 
for its bottomless bench. Four players average in double figures 
and Smith routinely substitutes for the entire starting five after 
the first four or five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett leads the team with 12.5 points and six rebounds a game,  
modest totals because of Kentucky's depth. Heshimu Evans averages 
11.8 points and five rebounds, Wayne Turner 10.7 points and 3.8 
assists and Michael Bradley 10.3 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky has held opponents to 37.9 percent shooting, the best  
at the school since 1962, and hopes to frustrate Szczerbiak as 
well. Smith said the best way to do that is to wear him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak's response: good luck. He averages about three  
minutes of bench time per game and has played every minute of the 
tournament so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is going to be our first 40-minute game,''  
Szczerbiak said. ``We've been doing this just about every time.''

<HEADLINE> Mets' Bonilla Out With Injured Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- New York Mets outfielder Bobby  
Bonilla will miss at least 10-14 days with an injured right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla underwent an MRI on Friday, which showed a partial tear  
in the posterior cruciate ligament. Bonilla will wear a brace but 
no surgery is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse new than what I thought when I came to the park,''  
Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``But it's better than I thought 
after I heard he (Bonilla) was going to get the MRI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla injured his right knee in a collision while running the  
bases against the Montreal Expos on March 8. He reaggravated the 
injury Thursday. The Mets said it was unsure if he would be healthy 
by opening day April 5 against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten days isn't bad, more than 10 is probably too much, seven  
days is good,'' Valentine said. ``We're not looking at the calendar 
as to when he's coming back, we'll just let doctors and nature take 
its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla is hitting .218 for the Mets this spring with one home  
run and two RBIs. Bonilla has been playing on the knee since the 
collision, but has complained of stiffness. Valentine said he 
hadn't given any thought as to who would take Bonilla's No. 5 spot 
in the batting order until his return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that he's very disappointed and I know he's worked  
extremely hard for three months getting ready to play,'' Valentine 
said of Bonilla. ``The thing that he likes to do the most is 
play.''

<HEADLINE> Media Groups To Form Europe Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Two major European media groups announced  
Friday they plan to develop a new European television network. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Mediaset SpA will team with KirchMedia, part of German  
media giant Kirch Group, to develop the new network. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement caps more than five months of talks. Rupert  
Murdoch's News Corp. had been in talks on joining Mediaset and 
Kirch, but is not part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the pact, Mediaset's parent company, will buy a 3.19  
percent stake in KirchMedia for $164.3 million. Fininvest said it 
has an option to significantly increase its stake in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Saudi investor Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Abdulaziz  
will buy 3.19 percent of KirchMedia. Al-Waleed already owns 2.3 
percent of Mediaset, while Kirch owns 1.3 percent and France's 
Canal Plus 6.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fininvest, controlled by former Italian Premier Silvio  
Berlusconi, owns 48.4 percent of Mediaset.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher  
Friday, with the key indexes rebounding sharply both in Japan and 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed  
660.86 points, or 4.20 percent, closing the week at 16,378.78 
points -- its highest close since July 31. On Thursday, the average 
closed down 550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, after hitting an 
eight-month high on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Friday's rally was partially a reaction to Thursday's  
sharp drop, traders said investors were encouraged by continued 
corporate restructuring by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors were large net buyers on the growing view that  
Japan's economy may have hit bottom, traders said. The rise in New 
York stocks overnight was another bullish factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 six times  
Thursday before closing at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.52 yen in the late  
afternoon, down 1.00 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its 
late New York level of 117.45 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the key index surged 4 percent in reaction to  
sharp gains on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 423.60 points to close at 11,082.92, its highest 
level since April, 1998. On Thursday, the index slumped 280.75 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was boosted by the sharp gains  
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong investors were also hoping for a cut in local interest  
rates. After the market closed, the Hong Kong Association of Banks 
announced that it would leave interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean share prices also surged, spurred by rallies in  
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index  
rose 25.24 points, or 4.4 percent, to 604.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher for the sixth consecutive  
session, with the key index finishing just short of the key 
7,000-point level as investors poured into commodity-related stocks 
on the back of improving product prices. The Weighted Stock Price 
Index rose 102.28 points, or 1.48 percent, to a 14-week high of 
6,997.29. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with dealers  
saying the market received some support from a 1.2 percent surge on 
Wall Street overnight. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 11.52 points, 
or 0.5 percent, to 2,152.95. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on profit-taking after  
three days of gains. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 
selected companies fell 17.59 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,006.46. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, helped by a  
strong banking and finance sector. The All Ordinaries Index rose 
16.8 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,984.5. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mostly lower. The  
benchmark Composite Index slipped 1.43 points to close at 513.91. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher. The Straits Times  
Index rose 6.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,472.99. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesia share prices closed higher, boosted by the  
bullish sentiment sweeping through major Asian markets. The 
Composite Index rose 6.336 points, or 1.6 percent, to 394.217. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of

<HEADLINE> Liz Taylor Gown Tops Oscar Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Oscar couture proved to be very lucrative.  
</P>
<P>
	Toymaker Mattel Inc. paid $167,500 for one of Elizabeth Taylor's  
bosom-baring gowns and the Home Shopping Network shelled out 
$79,500 for a Madonna ensemble Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's auction house said the price for Miss Taylor's gown,  
which she wore to the 1969 Oscars, was the second-highest ever for 
a dress at auction, after the $222,500 paid for one of Princess 
Diana's dresses in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of 56 dresses worn to four decades of Academy Awards  
ceremonies brought in $786,120, including premiums. 
``Unforgettable: Fashion of the Oscars'' was a benefit for the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel bought the Taylor gown over the phone. The  
waist-cinching, violet-and-periwinkle gown was designed to call 
attention to a 69.42-carat diamond necklace her then-husband 
Richard Burton had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore the dress, designed by legendary Hollywood costumer  
Edith Head, to introduce best picture nominee ``Midnight Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auctioneer Francois Curiel, deputy chairman of Christie's, said  
Miss Taylor listened to the bidding over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she was very, very pleased,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Madonna had donated the black-and-gray Jean-Paul Gaultier  
ensemble that she wore in 1998 to present the Oscar for best song 
from a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Shopping Network President Mark Bozek said the network  
would use the outfit ``to further awareness of AmFAR.'' He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	American Movie Classics and its spin off, Romance Classics,  
bought four dresses, including gowns worn by best actress nominee 
Kate Winslet in 1998 and Janet Leigh in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable channels paid $57,500 for the ``Titanic'' star's  
forest green silk crepe Givenchy gown and $34,500 for the silver 
beaded Edith Head evening dress Leigh wore to present two Oscars 
for best screenplay with her husband, Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified buyer spent $17,250 on the outfit actress Cate  
Blanchett is expected to wear at this Sunday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	John Gonzalez and Kevin Kladakis of Tampa, Fla., posed proudly  
with the Prada silk gown worn by Sigourney Weaver to the 1997 
Oscars. They bought it for $4,025. 
</P>
<P>
	``She looked stunning in it,'' recalled Gonzalez, who said he  
and Kladakis planned to display the dress to raise money for AIDS 
organizations.

<HEADLINE> New DNC Co-Chair Lays Out Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From lining up 1 million Democratic volunteers  
to creating a voter profiling system, the incoming co-chair of the 
Democratic National Committee is laying out a broad new agenda to 
expand the party's reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, in a speech he was to deliver today when he formally  
takes the position, describes his approach as both ``high-tech and 
high-touch.'' His America 2000 plan calls for a wide range of 
efforts to build greater support for the party, including going 
door-to-door in rural areas and targeting potential voters via 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as businesses across America are changing the way they  
operate, we will electrify, digitize, and personalize the way we do 
politics in every election,'' said Andrew, President Clinton's 
choice to run the DNC's day-to-day operations. ``We will make the 
party of high hopes the party of high-tech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To this end, he announced plans to create a National Voter File  
to profile and target voters across the country. With this 
information, party members can deliver a customized message to 
voters, Andrew said. He also detailed an initiative to spend $1 
million to equip state parties with the voter file and upgrade 
their software. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC also intends to establish a Democratic Internet Center,  
hiring staff and buying new equipment so party members can utilize 
the latest innovations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andrew says his aim is to invest not only in technology but  
in the talent of party leaders and grassroots activists. He wants 
to recruit 1 million volunteers by 2000 to help raise money and 
awareness of issues, and wants Young Democrats and College 
Democrats to add 1,000 new college and county chapters by then as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	He unveiled several efforts to draw on the strength of party  
officials at all levels, including establishing a Democratic Mayors 
Campaign Committee lead by Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew said the committee will launch a National Executive  
Director Program this year to bring top political professionals to 
states where they can lend their expertise to strengthen 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew brushed broad stroke differences between the attitudes of  
the Democratic and Republican parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the midst of undeniably good times, they still see an enemy  
under every bed, a crack in every sidewalk, a cloud behind every 
silver lining,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised that GOP candidates would face a fierce battle in  
upcoming elections. The committee plans to create a team to bolster 
candidates in off-term elections, particularly in the South, and 
after that will begin full throttle on 2000 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're finished, Republicans are going to have a very  
serious Y2K problem,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Addresses Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is offering two free software  
programs on its Internet site to strip out an identifying number 
that could be used to trace the authorship of some electronic 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	One program is a small patch to repair the problem and prevent  
the number from being planted in such documents. The second removes 
the number from existing documents. Both were made available 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed earlier this month that its latest version  
of Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer. That 
number partly is planted within some documents created with its 
popular collection of Office 97 business programs, which include 
Word and Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company also acknowledged it may have been  
collecting those serial numbers from customers -- along with names 
and addresses -- even when customers explicitly had indicated they 
did not want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denied it ever used the serial number together with  
its customer lists to track documents. But privacy groups 
complained that it made it technically possible for the company to 
trace documents to a specific computer even when an author wished 
to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the numbers originally were used to support a  
feature -- never fully developed -- to ``link'' documents on the 
Internet or an internal computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also promised to purge any serial numbers it may have  
gathered when customers registered their Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is falling under some scrutiny over the controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a privacy advocate, filed a  
formal complaint with Trust-E of Palo Alto, Calif., which agrees to 
regulate a company's Internet privacy policies in exchange for a 
seal of approval to reassure customers online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft is a corporate partner with Trust-E and pays it  
$100,000 annually, putting the organization in the uncomfortable 
position of being asked to investigate a possible privacy violation 
by one of its largest benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E said it would decide today whether an investigation was  
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, the Swedish Computer Inspectorate is considering a  
request to investigate whether Microsoft violated tough new privacy 
laws there. 
</P>
<P>
	Those laws, now the subject of negotiations with the U.S.  
Commerce Department, prohibit the transfer of personal information 
about citizens to any country outside the European Union unless the 
citizens consent to the disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	------

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week higher  
Friday, with the key indexes rebounding sharply both in Japan and 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed  
660.86 points, or 4.20 percent, closing the week at 16,378.78 
points -- its highest close since July 31. On Thursday, the average 
closed down 550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, after hitting an 
eight-month high on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Friday's rally was partially a reaction to Thursday's  
sharp drop, traders said investors were encouraged by continued 
corporate restructuring by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors were large net buyers on the growing view that  
Japan's economy may have hit bottom, traders said. The rise in New 
York stocks overnight was another bullish factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 six times  
Thursday before closing at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 117.52 yen in the late  
afternoon, down 1.00 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its 
late New York level of 117.45 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the key index surged 4 percent in reaction to  
sharp gains on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 423.60 points to close at 11,082.92, its highest 
level since April, 1998. On Thursday, the index slumped 280.75 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the Hong Kong market was boosted by the sharp gains  
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong investors were also hoping for a cut in local interest  
rates. After the market closed, the Hong Kong Association of Banks 
announced that it would leave interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean share prices also surged, spurred by rallies in  
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seoul Stock Exchange's Korea Composite Stock Price Index  
rose 25.24 points, or 4.4 percent, to 604.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher for the sixth consecutive  
session, with the key index finishing just short of the key 
7,000-point level as investors poured into commodity-related stocks 
on the back of improving product prices. The Weighted Stock Price 
Index rose 102.28 points, or 1.48 percent, to a 14-week high of 
6,997.29. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with dealers  
saying the market received some support from a 1.2 percent surge on 
Wall Street overnight. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 11.52 points, 
or 0.5 percent, to 2,152.95. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on profit-taking after  
three days of gains. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 
selected companies fell 17.59 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,006.46. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, helped by a  
strong banking and finance sector. The All Ordinaries Index rose 
16.8 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,984.5. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed mostly lower. The  
benchmark Composite Index slipped 1.43 points to close at 513.91. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher. The Straits Times  
Index rose 6.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,472.99. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesia share prices closed higher, boosted by the  
bullish sentiment sweeping through major Asian markets. The 
Composite Index rose 6.336 points, or 1.6 percent, to 394.217. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of  
Thailand (SET) index rose 4.78 points, or 1.3 percent, to 367.69.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index recovered to  
an eight-month high on a rally in blue chips today, rebounding from 
the previous day's sharp drop. The dollar slid against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.52 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.00  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 117.45 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 660.86  
points, or 4.20 percent, closing the week at 16,378.78 points -- its 
highest close since July 31. On Thursday, the average closed down 
550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, after hitting an eight-month high 
on Wednesday. Today's high was just a tick above that figure. 
</P>

Thursday before closing at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 867  
million shares, down from Thursday's turnover of 1.30 billion 
shares. Advances outnumbered retreats 899 to 314, with 111 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among today's gainers were blue chips, including Sony Corp.,  
Toyota Motor Corp. and Kyocera. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 38.52 points, or 3.13 percent, to 1,269.76. 
The TOPIX lost 28.85 points, or 2.29 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slid as overseas investors  
bought yen to invest in rising Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just short-term foreign speculators but also  
long-term investors such as U.S. mutual and pension funds who are 
selling dollars for yen to invest in Japanese stocks,'' said Shuji 
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But other players retreated to the sidelines prior to a  
three-day weekend in Japan. The dollar ranged between 116.90 yen 
and 117.80 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Monday, March 22, for  
Spring Equinox Day, a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.36 yen, down  
from 130.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.665 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.685 percent, 
driving its price up 101.08 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Celebrates Tournament Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A small Jesuit-run university is shedding  
its straitlaced image with the advance of its basketball team into 
the NCAA's Elite Eight. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, academics seem to have taken a back seat to athletics  
and celebrations during Gonzaga's remarkable run. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody in campus officialdom seems to be complaining -- not even  
Gonzaga's security director, who was surprised when about 1,500 
students staged an impromptu rally following Thursday night's 73-72 
upset of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering was the biggest in memory on the campus of 4,506  
students. 
</P>
<P>
	A few celebrants broke bottles in a campus square next to a  
statue of Gonzaga alumnus Bing Crosby that had been decked out in 
an NCAA basketball T-shirt and a ``Go Zags'' sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Some male students ran with their shirts off, hung from tree  
branches and rode an antique fire engine, siren wailing, through 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, students picked up the refuse amid the campus'  
turn-of-the-century buildings. And the statue of the famed crooner 
had shed its basketball attire by Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's indicative of the spirit here,'' security director  
Jeffery D. Hart said. ``I think there's a reputation that we're 
more studious and regimented than other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've shown we can have fun, Everybody is getting in on it  
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Robert Spitzer and several other campus  
administrators have spent much of the week in Phoenix, site of the 
NCAA's West Region finals. 
</P>
<P>
	With them are hundreds of students who took off the week after  
spring break and boarded chartered buses for the 1,300-mile journey 
to Arizona, leaving behind the mid-March chill of this Eastern 
Washington city of 188,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who stayed behind have become accustomed to seeing empty  
seats in classrooms, and television crews visiting campus to tell 
the story of the team's run to the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	Some classes have been canceled or cut short.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really difficult to study at all this week,'' said  
senior Peter Tuenge, a history and philosophy double-major from 
Boulder, Colo. ``The professors are being lenient, which is great. 
They've become caught up in the excitement, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gonzaga's tournament run has trimmed the ranks of  
students on campus, there's been no shortage of artists to 
spray-paint tributes to the Bulldogs on a campus wall officially 
designated for graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, graffiti painted following the Bulldogs' first- and  
second-round victories over Minnesota and Stanford was replaced by 
an ``Elite Eight'' design. 
</P>
<P>
	It's heady stuff for a school that has an annual athletic budget  
of just $3.2 million and does not field a football team. 
</P>
<P>
	Some joke that divine forces are at work.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's that Jesuit magic,'' said Laura Curd, one of the graffiti  
artists. ``It's almost like God's on our side. Everything is 
falling into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university, founded in 1887, is named for St. Aloysius  
Gonzaga, a 16th century Jesuit priest remembered these days as the 
patron saint of youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Students on Friday expressed confidence in their team, but  
acknowledge the 10th-seeded Bulldogs may need divine assistance in 
defeating top-seeded Connecticut in Saturday's West Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be near the end of the run, but with the way things  
have been going, another upset is definitely possible,'' freshman 
Mark Case said. ``We might go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we won't be a cinderella team anymore. Next year, everyone  
will shooting for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball success is nothing new at Gonzaga, which plays in the  
low-profile West Coast Conference. The most famous former Bulldogs 
player is the Utah Jazz's John Stockton, the NBA career assists 
leader. Gonzaga has won at least 20 games six times this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Bulldogs lose Saturday, the school will have  
succeeded in getting more of the national media to pronounce the 
school's name correctly. For the record, it's ``Gone-zag'-uh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any expectations coming into the tournament, so  
the excitement has just been building with each win,'' Tuenge said. 
``With the success of the basketball team, our academic reputation

<HEADLINE>  Russia Bomb Blast Kills 56 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A powerful bomb shattered an outdoor food market  
packed with families doing their weekend shopping in southern 
Russia today, killing at least 56 people and wounding scores of 
others, emergency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb exploded in downtown Vladikavkaz, the regional capital  
of North Ossetia, which borders the breakaway region of Chechnya. 
The blast raked the busy market, shattering stalls and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place looks like a meat grinder,'' said local journalist  
Olga Vyslova, reached by phone from Moscow, adding that the blast 
scene was littered with severed heads and limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing,  
but the region is awash with crime and violence, with many parts of 
nearby Chechnya controlled by armed bands since Chechens won de 
facto independence in 1996 following a bloody two-year war with 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasily Yurchuk, a duty officer at the Ministry of Emergency  
Situations in Moscow, said the blast killed 56 people and injured 
102. 
</P>
<P>
	Local people, many of them crying and shaking with grief,  
searched through the debris for survivors or helped ferry the 
injured to the hospital in ambulances and cars. Dozens of police 
officers and soldiers joined in the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the condition of the bodies made it difficult to  
determine how many people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many killed and injured. The situation is very  
confused,'' a police officer reached by phone said before hanging 
up abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulance workers and police used trolleys, normally used to  
shift boxes of vegetables, to remove bodies. Many of the victims 
were cut in half by the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb exploded near a row of stalls selling potatoes and many  
of the dead and injured appeared to be pensioners and poor workers, 
witnesses said. Blood covered surrounding walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical and emergency rescue teams from around the region were  
sent to the city to help overwhelmed local hospitals cope with the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no immediate details on what happened or who may have  
been responsible for the bombing. Local officers estimated the bomb 
had a blast equivalent to eight pounds of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin told Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin,  
head of the country's law enforcement services, and Vladimir Putin, 
head of the Federal Security Service, to fly to Vladikavkaz to 
personally head the investigation into the bombing. Vladikavkaz is 
some 937 miles southeast of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply shocked by the news of the barbaric action, which  
claimed dozens of victims. I consider this bloody crime an attempt 
to destabilize the situation in the northern Caucasus, to sow 
enmity and hatred,'' Yeltsin said in a telegram to North Ossetian 
President Alexander Dzasokhov. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Caucasus region has been hit by a wave of violence  
and lawlessness in recent years because of political and ethnic 
unrest and crime. Hundreds of people were killed in a short but 
bloody ethnic war that swept North Ossetia in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A EURO 2000 soccer match is scheduled to be held in Vladikavkaz  
next week between Russia and the tiny country of Andorra. The 
Andorra soccer federation earlier this month expressed concern 
about their team's safety in Vladikavkaz because of its proximity 
to Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, the Russian interior minister, said Wednesday the  
Andorra concerns were unjustified. He told reporters that he 
``guarantees absolute security for the match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they doubted the bombing had any connection to the  
soccer match, but all possibilities were being investigated.

<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Marion Jones and Michael  
Johnson won their 200-meter races Friday at the Engen Grand Prix 
Summer Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones led from start to finish and was timed in 21.84, slower  
than her best of 21.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in great shape,'' said after her race in Roodepoort, a  
Johannesburg suburb. ``I feel good. I feel fast. And I'm ready to 
run faster than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second was Wendy Hartman with 22.74 and fellow South African  
Heide Feyerling finished third at 23.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the world-record holder in the 200 at 19.32, won in  
20.10. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's where I want to be at this stage of the season,'' Johnson  
said after beating fellow American Kevin Braunskill, who was second

<HEADLINE> La. Rivals Face Regional Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They had to travel nearly 2,000 miles for a  
game not likely to be played in Louisiana any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Louisiana Tech (28-2), on a 20-game winning streak,  
and No. 4 seed Louisiana State (22-7) will meet for the first time 
since 1991 in an NCAA West Regional semifinal Saturday night at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly don't need to play Louisiana Tech to strengthen my  
schedule,'' LSU coach Sue Gunter said. ``I don't think Leon 
(Barmore, Tech coach) needs to play LSU. It really is no value to 
either of our programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barmore has the 200-mile trip from Tech in Ruston to LSU in  
Baton Rouge memorized. He takes his dog to a vet clinic at LSU, and 
joked about the speeding tickets he's received along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the very thing we need to avoid,'' Barmore said. ``You  
start focusing on why we don't play each other, UCLA comes in and 
kicks everyone's butt and goes to the Final Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 5 seed UCLA (25-7) only had to drive 10 miles down the  
freeway for its game against second-seeded Colorado State (33-2). 
</P>
<P>
	The winners advance to the regional final Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
	In their last meeting eight years ago, LSU defeated Tech 76-70  
in Ruston. The Lady Tigers have won five of their last six games, 
including an upset of No. 1 Tennessee 72-69 on Feb. 21. Tech lost 
to Tennessee in the national title game last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to try and get into a track meet,'' Gunter  
said. ``We will look for opportunities to run, as will Louisiana 
Tech. But Tech boards better than anyone. It's very hard to run 
after a made basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tech is led by Amanda Wilson, who averages 16 points and 7.8  
rebounds. LSU doesn't start anyone over 5-foot-11, while Wilson and 
Shaka Massey top 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither team can allow the other to have a bunch of transition  
baskets,'' Barmore said. ``If either team runs a lot, that team's 
going to win. Transition defense is the key. Turnovers have to be 
kept to a minimum. Guard play will be very important. If the guards 
for either team have a terrible night, turn it over, that team 
won't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA will pit its dominating post players -- 6-3 Maylana Martin  
and 6-4 Janae Hubbard -- against smaller Colorado State, which 
relies on its perimeter game. Martin, the Pac-10 Conference player 
of the year, averages 18.6 points and 9.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always at a bit of a disadvantage size-wise on the  
defensive end,'' Colorado State coach Tom Collen said. ``We know 
they're a big strong team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams have shot 759 3-pointers this season -- averaging 21.7 a  
game -- nearly triple the Bruins' 261 attempts. Most of Colorado 
State's long-range shots come from guard Becky Hammon, who hits 41 
percent of her 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a shooter. She has more of a scorer's mentality than I  
do,'' said UCLA guard Erica Gomez, who will help defend Hammon. 
``She's their spark. We'll try to contain her and take away the 
3s.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Women's Tournament Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee isn't perfect as it was at this team a year ago, but  
it still takes a near-perfect game to beat the Lady Vols. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Tennessee is on, even that might not be enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we're at the top of our game -- Tennessee wins,'' said  
Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, whose top-seeded team plays Virginia 
Tech in the NCAA East Regional semifinals at Greensboro, N.C., on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we bring our `A' game, then we're going to be a hard team  
to beat in March,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech will try anyway as the women's tournament heads  
into the round of 16 with the top 16 seeds all still alive. The 
Hokies (28-2) won their first 18 games this season, beating Duke 
and Virginia during that streak, and as underdogs are confident and 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year coach Bonnie Henrickson knows what her team is up  
against. 
</P>
<P>
	``They realize that 1-on-1 we're overmatched at each position,''  
she said. ``But we haven't let it go 1-on-1 all year, we don't play 
that way. We rely on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major concern for Tennessee in its bid for a fourth straight  
national championship has been guard Semeka Randall's sprained 
ankle. At one point, Summitt said she thought Randall could play. 
Later, she said she might not decide until halftime Saturday 
whether to use her. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion (28-3), which lost to Tennessee in the 1997  
national championship game, plays Duke (26-6) in the other East 
semifinal. Duke has a well-balanced team that will have to contend 
with an Old Dominion defense that has forced its first two NCAA 
opponents into 62 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name of the game is not necessarily going to be scoring,  
but taking care of the ball to allow us to score,'' Duke coach Gail 
Goestenkors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballhandling also will be a concern for Iowa State, which plays  
top-seeded Connecticut in the Mideast Regional at Cincinnati. 
Connecticut (29-4) presses from start to finish, something Iowa 
State (24-7) hasn't seen much of this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Cyclones can give the ball to all-Big 12 point guard  
Stacy Frese and they put a lot of good shooters on the floor with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first five to 10 minutes are crucial,'' said Megan Taylor,  
one of those shooters. ``If you get down early, your confidence 
will drop. Against a team like UConn, you might not be able to come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia (25-6) plays Clemson (26-5) in the other Mideast game  
and an ugly, low-scoring affair would suit Georgia coach Andy 
Landers just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got all the confidence in the world if we don't put a lot  
of points on the board, because we're a good defensive team,'' 
Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Purdue (30-1) risks its 28-game winning streak  
against a quick, athletic team from North Carolina (28-7) in the 
Midwest Regional at Normal, Ill., a matchup of sensational 
backcourts. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue has All-American Stephanie White-McCarty, Ukari Figgs and  
Katie Douglas. North Carolina counters with sophomores Nikki 
Teasley and Juana Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's said they have the best backcourt in the nation, but  
there's some contradiction about that,'' Teasley said. ``Because we 
feel like we have a good backcourt with Juana and myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a great matchup, but it's not Juana and  
myself against Ukari Figgs and Stephanie White. It's Carolina 
against Purdue. Lord willing, we'll come up with a victory. It's 
going to be an exciting game. Don't miss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers (28-5), one of the nation's top defensive teams, will  
try to shut down Texas Tech (30-3) and second-team All-American 
Angie Braziel in the other Midwest game. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (28-2), riding a 20-game winning streak, and  
Louisiana State (22-7) traveled halfway across the country to meet 
in the West Regional at Los Angeles. They last met in 1991 and 
aren't interested in scheduling each other during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the very thing we need to avoid,'' Tech coach Leon  
Barmore said. ``You start focusing on why we don't play each other, 
UCLA comes in and kicks everyone's butt and goes to the Final 
Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA (25-7) has to drive only 10 miles down the freeway for its  
game against Colorado State (33-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's winners meet in the regional finals Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bombing Lawsuit Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A lawsuit filed by the husband of the woman  
killed in the 1996 bombing in Centennial Olympic Park has been 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Charles L. Carnes denied John Hawthorne's motion that the  
Georgia Recreational Property Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. The 
act protects property owners who make their property available for 
public recreational use free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawthorne's wife, Alice, was killed in the bombing.  
</P>
<P>
	He sued for unspecified damages contending that the Atlanta  
Committee for the Olympic Games and other defendants failed to keep 
the park safe and did not adequately clear the grounds before the 
bomb exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnes in January dismissed a similar suit filed by 37 people  
wounded in the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel this is no setback at all because the judge had already  
announced his feeling about the Olympic Park,'' said Hawthorne's 
lawyer, Gilbert H. Deitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Deitch said he would appeal the decision to the Georgia Supreme  
Court.

<HEADLINE> First Union Bank Cutting 5,800 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- First Union is looking to save $300 million  
in 1999 by cutting 5,850 jobs in a restructuring plan related to 
last year's merger with CoreStates Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts announced Friday, representing 7 percent of First  
Union's work force, will hit hardest in the Carolinas and 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger between First Union, now the nation's sixth-largest  
bank, and Philadelphia-based CoreStates was a $16.1 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking company had said last month it was considering  
cutting as many as 7,150 jobs. Its combined work force is about 
79,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect any additional (cuts) in 1999 and quite  
frankly don't expect any others going forward,'' bank President 
John Georgius said in a conference call with stock analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoff notices were delivered to employees in late February and  
early March, company officials said. Those employees losing their 
jobs will receive a severance package. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,400 jobs are being eliminated in Pennsylvania, including  
732 in Philadelphia. A total of 1,374 jobs are being cut in North 
Carolina and South Carolina, including about 950 in the Charlotte, 
N.C., area, where First Union is based. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, 500 cuts are planned in Sacramento, Calif., where  
the company's Money Store unit is based. The remainder are 
scattered nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that we're terribly surprised with the cutback,''  
said Jim McManus, senior vice president for the Philadelphia 
Chamber of Commerce. ``I don't think the Greater Philadelphia area 
is taking any proportionately larger hit than any other area under 
the First Union umbrella of operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry has seen major layoffs over the past half  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since October, there have been 26,750 job cuts announced by  
major banks, including First Union, BankAmerica, Banker's Trust and 
CitiGroup have totaled 26,750, according to Challenger, Gray &AMP; 
Christmas, a job outplacement firm. 
</P>
<P>
	After the cutbacks, First Union will employ more than 15,000 in  
Charlotte and about 5,500 in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union also warned Friday that its first-quarter earnings  
would be hurt by $380 million in one-time expenses related to the 
CoreStates merger and the restructuring. About $200 million of 
those expenses are related to personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, First Union  
fell 75 cents a share to $54.50. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking analyst Claire Percarpio of Janney Montgomery Scott in  
Philadelphia said the layoffs were mostly in line with 
expectations, but that the layoffs and lower short-term profit 
expectations would dampen Wall Street perceptions of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it's tough to not harm your revenues at all when  
you do 7 percent staff cuts,'' Percarpio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a `show me' kind of thing. I think management has  
lost credibility with the market for good reason,'' she added. 
``They're a company with good products and good execution that just 
paid too much for a series of acquisitions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company, with assets of $237 billion, operates banking  
offices on the East Coast from Connecticut to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides cutting jobs, First Union also said the restructuring  
will include getting out of the business of indirect, dealer-based 
auto lending and instead focusing on direct auto loans.

<HEADLINE> School Where 92 Kids Killed Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Catholic school that was rebuilt after a deadly  
fire 40 years ago claimed the lives of 92 children is closing its 
doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1958 fire, Our Lady of the Angels has become a symbol  
of endurance in this ever-changing city. 
</P>
<P>
	The school survived a massive rebuilding effort. The  
neighborhood around it changed. And new safety standards were put 
in place at schools across the nation as a result of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But low enrollment and financial woes will force the Chicago  
Archdiocese to close Our Lady of the Angels and two other parochial 
schools by the end of the school year, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came only days after Cardinal Francis George  
warned lawmakers that more Catholic schools would have to be 
shuttered if private school parents don't get tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I regret the closing of these schools, and I am especially sad  
to close Our Lady of the Angels school, which the parish worked so 
hard to rebuild,'' George said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It was mid-afternoon on Dec. 1, 1958, when the fire broke out.  
Authorities think it started in a pile of trash in a stairwell. 
Smoke and flames traveled quickly up an open stairwell, spreading 
out on the top floor and trapping many of the school's 1,300 
students and teachers in their rooms. 
</P>

	In the aftermath, school systems nationwide began requiring

	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Because of the recent agreement limiting  
cigarette sponsorship of sporting events, Jerry Forsythe's CART 
team is running without its sponsor's name emblazoned on the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Player's Ltd., a Canadian brand owned by American company Philip  
Morris, has been taken off the two Forsythe Reynards at 
Miami-Homestead Speedway, where the season-opening Marlboro Grand 
Prix of Miami will be run Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement between major U.S. tobacco companies and attorneys  
general in 46 states limits each company to spotlighting one brand 
in a sporting event. According to Player's Ltd., Philip Morris 
terminated the licensing agreement because the U.S. company's 
Marlboro brand is the lead sponsor on the Team Penske car driven by 
Al Unser Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we're obliged to remove our brand name because it  
is owned by Philip Morris, which already uses the Marlboro name for 
its sponsorship activities in auto racing,'' said Jean-Paul Blais, 
president of Players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forsythe team fields cars in the CART FedEx Championship  
Series for Canadian drivers Greg Moore and Patrick Carpentier. This 
week, those cars are adorned with the team's racing logo but no 
brand name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to talk with Philip Morris to see if we can  
reach a compromise, but I am confident that the Player's CART team 
will find a way to make itself visible this weekend with a strong 
performance,'' Blais said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	OUT OF ACTION: Rookie Shigeaki Hattori of Japan sustained a  
concussion Friday in a hard crash during practice on the 1 1/2-mile 
Miami-Homestead Speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Hattori, who escaped injury in a crash at virtually the same  
place during preseason testing, this time was taken to Jackson 
Memorial Hospital in Miami, where he was in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART, said  
Hattori would be kept overnight for observation and will not be 
cleared to drive any more this weekend. That means his CART debut 
will be April 10 in the Firestone Firehawk 500 in Motegi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SWEET TRIBUTE: All the cars in Sunday's race will carry a decal  
dedicated to former NFL star Walter Payton, who is battling a liver 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The decal, which is placed on the cockpit area near the driver's  
helmet, reads: ``Get Well Sweetness'' and is accompanied by a 
football helmet with No. 34 on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton, co-owner of Payton-Coyne Racing, was known as Sweetness  
during his playing career with the Chicago Bears. He was diagnosed 
recently with primary sclerosing cholangitis and is awaiting a 
liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small tribute from a concerned CART community wanting  
to express support for a colleague and friend,'' said Mike Zizzo, 
director of public relations for CART. 
</P>

	BIG PAYOFF: Craftsman Tools, the sponsor of NASCAR's Truck  
Series, has offered a special incentive to five drivers who have 
taken part in every race since the series began in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time defending series champion Ron Hornaday, 1997 champion  
Jack Sprague, Rick Carelli, Butch Miller or Joe Ruttman can win an 
extra $100,000 by taking the checkered flag on April 3 at Evergreen 
Speedway in Monroe, Wash., in the 100th series race. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them, they have won 47 of the 97 races through the end of  
the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season begins here Saturday with the Florida Dodge  
Dealers 400. The NASCAR series is sharing the Homestead track with 
CART, the first time the two series' have been paired during a race 
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Metropolitan St. Seeks Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- It's difficult for Metropolitan State  
guard Shane Ah Matt to imagine himself in a more unlikely 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 24 hours before the Roadrunners (28-5) were to play  
for the Division II national championship, Ah Matt and his 
teammates spent part of Friday afternoon taping interview segments 
to be shown on CBS' national broadcast of the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't fully sunken in yet, but it is pretty amazing,'' the  
freshman from Adelaide, Australia, said of Saturday's showdown with 
top-ranked Kentucky Wesleyan. ``To think that we are one of two 
teams left out of 300 is just mind-boggling to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got here five days ago and everybody was asking `Metro  
who?' We still haven't gotten the respect we deserve. But if we go 
out and play our game the best we can, that respect will be there 
waiting for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Respect isn't a problem for top-ranked Kentucky Wesleyan, which  
finds itself in the title game for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers (34-2) already have a record six Division II  
championships and, after a disappointing loss to Cal-Davis in last 
year's title game, will settle for nothing less than a seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play for Kentucky Wesleyan and that means a lot,'' said  
senior forward Dana Williams, who on Friday was named a second-team 
Division II All-American. ``We go other places and they have 
regional championships and things like that hanging up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing we have is championship banners. That is instilled  
in us as soon as we step on the court. Championships are expected 
out of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Wesleyan, a school of about 800 students located in  
Owensboro, was anointed Division II's preseason No. 1 squad and 
held that distinction all but one week of the season. Led by 
Williams and Division II Player of the Year Antonio Garcia, the 
division's leading rebounder the past two seasons, the Panthers are 
big enough and quick enough to invoke nightmares for opposing 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	In tournament victories over Lander and Florida Southern, Garcia  
scored 26 points and pulled down 33 rebounds while Williams chipped 
in 42 points and 24 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nobody like Garcia in the country,'' Metropolitan  
State coach Mike Dunlap said. ``Nobody as big and nobody as skilled 
around the rim. There's just no way to play him man-on-man and when 
you double team, he passes like a guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Williams is just a thoroughbred -- one of those players  
with an NBA body that can do it all. The way he plays kind of 
reminds me of Stacey Augmon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metropolitan State, located in Denver, has a dynamic duo of its  
own in center Lee Barlow and guard DeMarcos Anzures. In victories 
over No. 3 Salem Teikyo and Truman State this week, Barlow scored 
56 points and grabbed 20 rebounds and Anzures added 26 points and 
10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both solid players that can hurt you,'' Kentucky  
Wesleyan coach Ray Harper said. ``Barlow is a big, tough, physical 
kid who likes to bang down low and Anzures is quick and crafty and 
can hurt you with his penetration or his shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the high expectations placed on his players, Harper said  
he hasn't seen any signs of pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids have lived for (Saturday) since sitting  
disappointed in the locker room last year,'' Harper said. 
``Everybody talks about pressure. But we've been ranked No. 1 all 
season long and pressure has never been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was any pressure, it would have been in getting back  
to this position. I think these guys really enjoy what most people 
would call pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although his squad has never even been on national television  
much less playing for a national title, Dunlap said his team will 
not be awe-struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expected anything from us, so where's the pressure?''  
he said. ``There wouldn't even be a betting line on this game in 
Vegas. We know we're the underdogs and we'll take that role. It's a 
comfortable jacket to wear and we wear it pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at the same time, we're not just happy to be here. From  
the moment we entered this tournament, we expected to win. We've 
been tough and aggressive in nature all year long and we're not 
going to stop being that way now.''

<HEADLINE> Oscars Move to Sunday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Never on Sunday for Oscar, the film industry  
said for 46 years. Too risky to air the Academy Awards on the 
weekend, when people should be buying movie tickets instead of 
enjoying a free TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chance to shore up TV ratings -- and a growing  
appreciation of the Academy Awards as an unparalleled promotional 
tool for Hollywood -- finally caused a reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
	When host Whoopi Goldberg steps on stage at 8:30 p.m. EST  
Sunday, ABC and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences 
hope that the weekend broadcast will be the start of a new 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great move,'' said Gil Cates, who is producing his  
ninth Oscar ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday is a festive day, a day of relaxation. It's a non-work  
day, and I think that comports well with what Oscar should be,'' he 
said. ``The whole phenomenon of folks rushing home from work to 
watch the show is going to be avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Oscar ratings rise and fall, the ceremony is  
television's second most-watched event after the Super Bowl. 
Commercial rates reportedly have reached $1 million for a 30-second 
spot, up from around $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the show is lacking a hit centerpiece like last year's  
``Titanic.'' Some of the nominees are in films largely unseen by 
moviegoers, such as best actor contenders Nick Nolte in 
``Affliction'' or Edward Norton in ``American History X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a blockbuster date, Oscar can be relatively unpopular.  
The 1997 ceremony, at which the highbrow film ``The English 
Patient'' dominated, had the second-worst ratings on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one is expecting the ceremony to match the 1998  
numbers, the best in 15 years, ABC is counting on the move from the 
show's longtime Monday berth and a half-hour earlier starting time 
to avoid a big deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday has the highest 'HUT' level of the week, more  
'households using television' than any other night,'' noted Michael 
Davies, ABC executive vice president in charge of specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier start ensures the ceremony will end at a reasonable  
hour, a ratings plus. Viewership tends to plummet when the Oscars 
stretch into the midnight hour on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The star quotient, of course, remains unchanged. Harrison Ford,  
Jack Nicholson, Denzel Washington, Kim Basinger, John Travolta, 
Annette Bening, Andy Garcia and Helen Hunt are among the 
presenters. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers are Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Whitney Houston,  
Mariah Carey, Randy Newman, Peter Gabriel, Allison Moorer and 
Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar winner Geena Davis (``The Accidental Tourist,'' 1988) will  
be host of an academy first: an exclusive pre-ceremony show 
beginning at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to attempt to give the audience a backstage pass  
and look at everything that goes into making the Oscar ceremony,'' 
said Davis. That includes clips of events leading up to the 
ceremony, such as the nominees' luncheon, and, of course, the 
fashion parade of arriving stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she immediately said yes to the job. ``I've always  
been a fan not only of the Oscars but of the excitement, and 
arrivals have always been a big part,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony itself will celebrate the waning century, Cates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inasmuch as film is a child of the 20th century and made its  
impact in the century, we're going to reflect on that,'' he said, 
including a look at what film's role might be in the next 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One era will loom especially large because of an honorary award  
being given to director Elia Kazan, whose critically acclaimed 
films include ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Gentleman's Agreement.'' 
Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are presenting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Kazan drew fire by giving the names of colleagues  
to the House Un-American Activities Committee investigating 
communist infiltration in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the passage of time, the award has divided the industry.  
``Age and ability in the arts or anything else, in my opinion, does 
not excuse a crime,'' said actor Rod Steiger, star of ``On the 
Waterfront.'' Actor Karl Malden was the member of the Academy's 
board who proposed the lifetime achievement award for Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd, citing  
the controversy, wrote in the trade paper's March 10 issue: ``I'm 
just one who will still remain seated during that honorary Oscar 
presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Cates: ``I think Army Archerd is dead wrong in his attitude  
toward Kazan. I think the academy is absolutely correct in honoring 
Kazan. He's a great director. ... I think the majority of the 
audience is delighted with that honorary Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging there are those who will refuse to applaud Kazan,  
Cates said: ``We'll show all.'' There will be no ``sweetening'' if 
the applause is scant or attempt to mask any boos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	OSCAR, CONTINUED: There's lots of Oscar to go around. Bill  
Maher's hourlong ``Politically Incorrect After Party,'' whose 
guests include Rod Steiger and William H. Macy, will follow the 
Academy Awards by a half-hour on ABC. The Oscar feast at E! 
Entertainment Television begins at noon EST Sunday with the 
six-hour ``E! Live Countdown to the Academy Awards '99.'' It 
continues with Joan and Melissa Rivers' arrivals coverage from 6-8 
p.m. EST and wraps with a midnight post-show.

<HEADLINE> Suit vs. Pats QB Reportedly Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The woman who sued New England Patriots  
quarterback Drew Bledsoe and lineman Max Lane over a notorious dive 
from a nightclub stage reportedly has agreed to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe on Friday reported that Tameeka Messier will  
collect $1.2 million in the settlement, which also involves the 
band Everclear and the Paradise Rock Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradise owner Seth Greenberg detailed the proposed settlement  
for The Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal had not been signed, Greenberg said, but had been  
agreed to ``in principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's on the table now, and it's just a matter of dotting the  
I's and crossing the T's,'' he told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Messier sued the Paradise, the players and Everclear, claiming  
she was seriously injured when Bledsoe and Lane dove off the stage 
into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Messier, who was 23 at the time, underwent surgery to remove two  
damaged disks from her neck and take pieces of hip bone to fuse her 
spinal column. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Comen, Lane's attorney, told The Associated Press on  
Friday that the settlement had not been finalized, ``but I expect 
that within a very short period of time a settlement will be 
documented and finalized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The details of the settlement are confidential but the details  
reported in The Globe are not accurate,'' Comen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe reported that insurance companies for the Paradise and  
Everclear would each pay $100,000. Bledsoe would contribute 
$400,000 and Lane would pay $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe's contract is worth $42 million over 7 years while Lane  
earns $11 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe, who weighs 235 pounds, and Lane, who weighs 305 pounds,  
admitted they dived off the stage on Nov. 13, 1997, but said they 
did not cause Messier's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to lawyers for Bledsoe, the Paradise and Messier were not  
immediately returned Friday.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cartoons Show Smoking, Drink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Is Dumbo the poster elephant for  
substance abuse? 
</P>
<P>
	A new study suggests the animated film star -- who inadvertently  
swills champagne and ends up dreaming of pink elephants -- and his 
cartoon peers aren't the best role models for kids when it comes to 
drinking or smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, unveiled Thursday in New York at an American Medical  
Association conference in New York, says more than two-thirds of 
the 50 G-rated, animated films released by major studios during the 
past 60 years portray alcohol or tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Adam O. Goldstein, assistant professor of family medicine at  
the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, said he began the study two 
years ago when he took his children to animated films and was 
struck by the amount of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I just chalked it up to an oversight in editing and  
writing, but then I decided it was more than just coincidence,'' 
said Goldstein, an anti-smoking activist. 
</P>
<P>
	The films studied were released between 1937 and 1997 by  
MGM/United Artists, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studies, Walt 
Disney Co. and Warner Bros. studios. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said 34 films contained at least one episode of  
tobacco or alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-six characters smoked for a total duration of more than  
45 minutes, and 63 characters drank alcohol for 27 minutes, he 
said, with good and bad characters alike consuming the substances. 
Cigar and wine consumption were the most common, but cigarettes, 
pipes, beer, spirits and champagne were consumed as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Characters who drank frequently got drunk, passed out, hiccuped,  
lost their balance or fell over, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``To suggest that Disney films endorse or support the use of  
tobacco and alcohol is absurd,'' said Walt Disney Co. spokeswoman 
Claudia Peters. ``As filmmakers, we have voluntarily taken the 
position that smoking and drinking should not be shown in a 
children's film except in rare instances where it is relevant to an 
adult characterization or plot point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathy Merlock Jackson, a film historian and author of a book on  
the Disney company, said an animated character's occasional vice is 
nothing to be terribly alarmed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are kids being led astray because someone is smoking in a  
Disney film? I'm not sure we can go that far,'' said Jackson, 
chairwoman of the communications department at Virginia Wesleyan 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein's report will appear in next week's issue of the  
Journal of the American Medical Association.

<HEADLINE> Shares in Japan Telecom Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading of Japan  
Telecom Co. on Friday following a news report that AT&AMP;T Corp. and 
British Telecommunications may buy a large stake in the 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. and British companies are negotiating with Japan  
Telecom -- one of Japan's four largest long-distance companies -- to 
buy a joint stake of 30 percent, the Nihon Keizai business daily 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been decided at this time about the reported  
tie-up with foreign capital,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Before trading was suspended, Japan Telecom shares soared 16.4  
percent to 1.42 million yen ($12,034) per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said negotiations have entered ``the final stage.''  
If true, it would be the first investment by foreign phone 
companies in a major Japanese long-distance provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom has struggled with declining earnings since Japan  
started deregulating its long-distance market in recent years. Last 
year, it recorded a net profit of $131 million on $3.3 billion in 
sales.

<HEADLINE> HMO Bill Moves Forward in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to tighten federal regulations on  
health maintenance organizations moved forward in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee  
approved a Republican bill in a party-line vote Thursday. A series 
of attempts to broaden the measure failed, but Democrats promised 
to raise those issues again when the legislation goes to the Senate 
floor, probably this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	During two days of debate, Democrats said they were looking out  
for patients and doctors while Republicans only cared about 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans repeatedly emphasized the need to control costs and  
prevent unintended consequences that could come from overly broad 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill offers a number of protections that even the insurance  
industry has little problem accepting. It guarantees patients the 
right to reasonable emergency room payments and direct access to 
gynecologists for women. It allows pregnant women and terminally 
ill patients to keep their doctors for 90 days if the doctors are 
dropped from the plan's network. 
</P>
<P>
	But these provisions apply only to about 48 million Americans  
covered by federally regulated health insurance plans. Other 
patients are covered by state regulations, Republicans argue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats complained that all Americans deserve these

<HEADLINE> Judge Defends Scoring in Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While Lennox Lewis fumed about being ``robbed,''  
the judge at the center of Lewis' controversial draw with Evander 
Holyfield maintained she scored it the way she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
	And apparently she couldn't see it as well as the other two  
judges because of her ringside position. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at a state Senate hearing Thursday if she had any second  
thoughts about scoring the fight for Holyfield in wake of the 
controversy, Jean Williams said, ``No sir, I scored what I saw when 
I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She saw it 115-113 for Holyfield.  
</P>
<P>
	Much has been made of Williams scoring the fifth round for  
Holyfield although Lewis, the WBC champion from Britain, outpunched 
WBA-IBF champion Holyfield 43-11 and had him pinned on the ropes 
for about 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Roy Goodman, chairman of Senate Committee on  
Investigations, asked Williams how she would score the round after 
she watched a tape of it at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like Lewis won that round,'' Williams said. ``But  
what I saw on TV is not what I saw that night. Certain punches I 
saw now I don't remember seeing them that night because of movement 
of the (ringside) photographer and the position of Lewis' body. 
What I saw in each individual round is what I scored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, appointed by the IBF, was backed up by WBC judge Larry  
O'Connell of England, who scored the fight even at 115-115. WBA 
judge Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa favored Lewis 116-113. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did notice she had the worse seat of the lot because she was  
surrounded by photographers,'' O'Connell told the hearing by 
telephone from England. ``You do miss things from different angles 
of the ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell and Christodoulou did not have photographers around  
them. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams had scored the fifth round for Lewis, her score  
would have been 114-114 and the outcome would have been the same 
because it would have been a majority draw. A fighter must win on 
two cards to get a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	`Everything should be looked into,'' Lewis said Thursday upon  
his return to London. Frank Maloney, Lewis' manager, however, said 
he didn't believe bribes had been paid, but that it was more a case 
of incompetent judging. 
</P>
<P>
	Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has convened a  
grand jury to issue subpoenas and gather testimony about the 
unification fight. The New York State Athletic Commission also is 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Williams and O'Connell adamantly denied anyone tried to  
influence their scoring in any way. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman asked Williams, a $39,200-a-year account clerk from  
Atlantic City, if anyone attempted to use her filing for bankruptcy 
to influence her judging. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	King also testified Thursday, saying, ``I have nothing to do  
with the selection of officials. I have no interest in who they 
will select.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, spoke to the hearing by  
telephone from Mexico City and said he hadn't wanted either an 
American or British judge, but three neutral judges. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gilberto Mendoza of Venezuela selected Christodoulou,  
Sulaiman said he picked Daniel van de Wiele of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Of IBF president Bob Lee's selection of Williams, a judge for 10  
years, Sulaiman said, ``It was not a good choice and I told that to 
Mr. Tony Russo (executive secretary of the New York commission). I 
said we needed an experienced official.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Lee picked Williams, Sulaiman said he told Russo ``for  
reasons of neutrality (on American, one British and one neutral 
judge) and for some protection for our champion, I would appoint 
Mr. Larry O'Connell.''

<HEADLINE> Near Miss Spurs New Pilot Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A United Airlines jumbo jet that lost power in  
an engine during takeoff from San Francisco dipped low enough that 
its thunderous roar set off car alarms and sent airport neighbors 
scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the Boeing 747 so badly mishandled the recovery  
last summer that the plane cleared the 1,576-foot-high San Bruno 
Mountain, a few miles to the north, by only 100 feet, government 
and airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pull up! Pull up!'' shouted other pilots in the cockpit, as  
the electronic voice in the plane's ground-proximity device warned: 
``Terrain! Terrain!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered new training  
for the airline's long-haul pilots. While all pilots must make at 
least three takeoffs and landings every 90 days, the crews that fly 
United's long trips must now make at least one set of them in a 
real plane, not the flight simulators routinely used. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is a simple one: Long trips entail a lot of flying  
but only one set of takeoffs and landings. Also, airlines send 
along two crews to guard against pilot fatigue, so pilots sitting 
at the controls for departure aren't the ones there for arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that division of labor, the pilot flying United  
Flight 863 last summer had made only one takeoff and landing in a 
real plane during the previous year. When real trouble hit, 
government and airline investigators found, he reacted wrongly. 
</P>
<P>
	Details on what happened on June 28 at San Francisco  
International Airport surfaced Friday in The Wall Street Journal. 
Because the pilots reported the incident through a voluntary 
self-disclosure program, neither the airline nor the government 
would comment extensively. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's account was gleaned through interviews and  
information gained via the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight was to be flown in one of the most modern planes in  
the sky, the Boeing 747-400. It is distinctive because it has a 
lengthy upper deck and turned-up wing tips. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was destined for Sydney, Australia, with 307 people  
aboard. Up on the flight deck, there were two sets of pilots, one 
to relieve the other in flight. Both sets normally rest in bunks 
just off the flight deck. 
</P>
<P>
	As Flight 863 lifted off the runway for its 14-hour, 25-minute  
journey, it was hit with one of the most practiced airplane 
emergencies, a failed engine. The plane's right inboard engine, one 
of four mounted on the wings, stalled. The co-pilot, who was flying 
the plane, correctly responded by shutting it down. 
</P>
<P>
	What he did next created near-fatal problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Because it was overpowered on the left, the plane started to  
turn to the right. The correct response would have been stepping on 
the left rudder pedal, which would straighten the nose. Instead the 
pilot aboard Flight 863 turned the control wheel to the left. That 
deployed panels on the plane's wing, reducing its lift. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly the stick began to shake, an automatic warning  
indicating a loss of lift is imminent. ``Push down! Push down!'' 
the extra flight crew yelled, which would have implemented a tactic 
to gain speed. 
</P>
<P>
	By then the plane was off course and headed for San Bruno  
Mountain. Now the ground-proximity device was belching its warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the plane cleared the mountain, it startled nearby  
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to have to go under the couch,'' the  
Journal quoted one as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The captain soon took control and landed the plane safely back  
at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the near collision, United has filmed the  
scenario in a simulator and shown the videotape to its 9,500 
pilots. It has also increased the frequency of refresher training 
for its 747-400 crews to twice a year, instead of once. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the airline has formed a committee to study  
possible changes in how its long-haul aircraft should be manned. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have a situation that's not routine, we try to use it  
to learn lessons,'' airline spokesman Andy Plews told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is satisfied with the changes and the real flight  
training it has ordered. It has no plans to change the rule that 
allows other airlines to complete the mandatory takeoff-and-landing 
practice in simulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each airline is different, and our experience is that with  
other airlines, which may not have as many long-haul flights, it 
may not be a problem for them,'' agency spokeswoman Alison Duquette 
said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Hires Ex-BMW Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former BMW AG product development chief Wolfgang  
Reitzle was named Friday to oversee the luxury divisions of Ford 
Motor Co., including Britain's Jaguar Cars Ltd. and the recently 
acquired Volvo Cars of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle's appointment had been expected for more than a month,  
virtually since he resigned in a management shakeup at BMW that 
also resulted in Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. Reitzle 
had been considered Pischetsrieder's heir apparent at the German 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ford, the highly respected Reitzle will be based in London as  
group vice president of the newly created premier automotive group. 
He becomes chairman of Jaguar and Volvo and will oversee Aston 
Martin and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of new President Jac Nasser's campaign to bring  
more outside executive talent to Ford as it tries to strengthen its 
No. 2 position worldwide and challenge the leadership of General 
Motors Corp. Like the other U.S.-based auto companies, Ford 
traditionally has promoted from within. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Volkswagen AG also reportedly had sought to hire Reitzle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Reitzle's worldwide experience in the premium segment and his  
appreciation of classic marques makes him a highly appropriate 
addition to our senior management team,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, Nick  
Scheele, was appointed senior vice president of Ford of Europe with 
responsibility for marketing, sales and service. Scheele was 
credited with turning the troubled British automaker around since 
he assumed the job in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle, 50, headed markets and product development for BMW, a  
maker of high-performance sports and luxury cars. He is credited 
with bringing many of BMW's most successful products to market. He 
also oversaw the development of the new X5 sport utility vehicle, 
which will be produced in South Carolina and go on sale later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute that led to his departure was over Pischetsrieder's  
strategy for turning around its money-losing Rover car unit in 
Britain. Ford's news release announcing Reitzle's appointment made 
no mention of BMW, where the executive had worked for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle will report directly to Nasser. He and Scheele also were  
named officers of the company.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Auctions Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A government auction of $6.05 billion  
in soured business loans attracted 13 bids on Friday including four 
from outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Restructuring Sector Authority is attempting to  
sell the last of the business loans of 56 finance companies shut 
down in December 1997 and ordered into liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is responsible for liquidation of the finance  
companies closed in 1997 by the government after Asia's economic 
slowdown plunged the financial sector into disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	At the first auction of major loans in December, bids were  
significantly lower than government expectations. The agency sold 
loans then for an average of 25 percent of outstanding principal 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions have improved for the auction. The parliament has  
approved bills to streamline bankruptcy and foreclosure 
proceedings, and the loan package sizes have been reduced to 
attract more bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the state Asset Management Corp. bid on all 46  
tranches Friday, while other bidders made offers on one to 43 
tranches each. The company was set up by the government as a buyer 
of last resort of the closed finance companies as last resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai authorities have assigned the AMC a similar role to that of  
the Resolution Trust Corp., which the United States used in its 
liquidation of bankrupt savings and loans associations in the late 
1980s and 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Another auction of small loans should be held by May.

<HEADLINE> Fisk Home Run Ball To Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- George Foster wants to cash in on a home run that  
nearly cost his team the 1975 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Cincinnati Reds left fielder has the ball that  
Carlton Fisk hit off the left-field foul poll to win the sixth game 
of the Series at Fenway Park. The Reds came back to win the 
decisive seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has kept the ball in his trophy case all these years and  
plans to sell it in June to the highest bidder in a national 
auction through Leland's Auctions of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, there was no talk about the ball itself,'' said  
Foster, in Boston this weekend on a promotional tour with the ball. 
``I just took it home with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk's spectacular homer made Red Sox and baseball history, as  
he tried to will the ball into fair territory with his body 
language while moving down the first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster caught the ball off the foul pole and tucked it into his  
glove as he hustled off the field that night. The game finished 
late due to a rain delay -- so he tossed the glove and the ball into 
his locker, and turned in for the night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won Game 7, so we packed everything back to Cincinnati,''  
said Foster, who went on to play left field for the New York Mets 
for four seasons before retiring from the game. ``I put the ball in 
my trophy case, where it's been ever since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster didn't give the ball much thought until recently, when  
the baseball that rolled through Bill Buckner's legs during the 
1986 World Series fetched $93,000 at auction and a fan paid 
$500,000 for Eddie Murray's 500th home run ball. 
</P>
<P>
	And when St. Louis Cardinal Mark McGwire's record-breaking 70th  
home run ball sold for nearly $3 million, Foster realized the Fisk 
ball could be valuable. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Appel, a spokesman for Leland's, said auctioneers  
authenticated the Fisk ball based on unique World Series markings, 
scuff marks consistent with the play and video footage of Foster 
making the catch. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, who lives in Connecticut with his wife and two teen-age  
daughters and holds sports clinics for children, said he isn't sure 
how much the ball will fetch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sky's the limit,'' he said. ``It was one of the most  
famous home runs ever.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs $174M Claim Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A key U.N. panel has ruled that Iraq will have to  
pay an additional $174 million to companies that suffered losses 
resulting from Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The total approved by the U.N. Compensation Commission Thursday  
includes $128 million to 45 Kuwaiti firms. The remaining amount 
goes to corporations based in other countries, said U.N. 
spokeswoman Therese Gastaut. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest amounts come on top of $2.73 billion already approved  
by the panel for payment to individuals, companies and governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation awards approved by the 15-nation commission are  
paid from Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has received a total of $240 billion in  
compensation demands from individuals, governments and corporations 
seeking compensation for deaths, loss and damage caused by the 
invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Processing the claims is expected to take several more years.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Combats Vaccine Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with a small but vocal resistance, the  
Pentagon is struggling to overcome what officials call an 
Internet-driven proliferation of myths and misinformation about the 
health risks of getting inoculated against the deadly biological 
agent anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
	At the heart of the problem: doubts among some troops that the  
Defense Department is telling all it knows about a vaccine that 
Defense Secretary William Cohen has ordered for all 2.4 million 
people in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Those doubts, whether reasonable or not, are spreading on  
Internet chat lines. ``Risking your health for something 
unproven,'' one man wrote this week on a newspaper-sponsored chat 
line, ``is almost as dumb as trusting anything the military has to 
say.'' Others wrote of being used as ``guinea pigs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials are fighting back with their own form of  
Internet ammunition, starting with a Web site titled ``Countering 
the Anthrax Threat,'' featuring a photograph of Cohen with his 
shirt sleeve rolled up, a smile on his face and an American flag in 
the background, receiving his vaccine shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's Web page also features a ``Fact vs. Myth''  
section aimed at dispelling what officials consider misconceptions 
about the necessity of inoculating the troops and the health risks 
they face. The first fact: ``Mortality levels from a biological 
attack could exceed that of a nuclear explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears  
Iraq, North Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might 
try. Anthrax is a naturally occurring bacteria found in 
domesticated animals; it can be produced as dry spores that, when 
inhaled, cause death within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Another myth, according to the Pentagon: ``The anthrax vaccine  
may cause sterility. Fact: The vaccination has been routinely used 
for the past 28 years and has not been associated with sterility. 
Although we cannot conduct experiments with lethal agents on the 
human reproductive system (for ethical reasons), there is ample 
evidence that it does not cause any harm or sterility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The myth-debunking effort has not convinced some doubters.  
Twenty-three sailors on the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt 
have refused to receive the vaccination and have been disciplined 
with fines, extra duty and demotions in rank. The Roosevelt is due 
to leave port at Norfolk, Va., on March 26 to begin a six-month 
deployment in the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says it is not counting, but apparently 100 to 200  
service members so far have refused the vaccination. This is a tiny 
fraction of the approximately 220,000 people who have received it. 
</P>
<P>
	The resisters reportedly include about three dozen Marines and  
about 50 Air Force members, in addition to the defiant sailors. 
Nine members of the Connecticut Air National Guard resigned rather 
than take the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a phased inoculation program announced by Cohen last May, all  
troops serving in the Persian Gulf and East Asia -- considered the 
highest-risk areas for anthrax attack -- must get the vaccination. 
Starting this summer, the shots will be given to all troops in 
units designated for early deployment to either the Gulf or Korea 
in the event of war. And beginning in about 2003, the rest of the 
military will get the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics point to the Pentagon's checkered history of sharing  
facts on radiation exposure to troops in nuclear tests in the 
1950s, illnesses attributed to the herbicide Agent Orange in the 
Vietnam War, and speculation about the root causes of unexplained 
illnesses among thousands of Gulf War veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pentagon has been misleading at best and disingenuous at  
worst,'' says Mark S. Zaid, who was the lead civil defense attorney 
for Airman 1st Class Jeffrey A. Bettendorf, who refused to receive 
the anthrax vaccine and was discharged in early March under ``other 
than honorable conditions'' for his defiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaid contends that Pentagon officials have understated the risk  
of bad reactions to the shots and that there has been too little 
scientific study of the vaccine's long-term health effects on 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really scared,'' Zaid says, and some would rather  
end their careers than have the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials say they are concerned by the resistance, but  
they do not expect it to snowball into a major rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gen. Charles Roadman, the Air Force surgeon general, said in  
an interview that he is bothered by even the limited number of 
resisters. He says the Pentagon has ``framed the problem wrong'' 
and should be telling troops it's not the vaccination they should 
fear but the possibility of facing anthrax without it. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadman has received the six-shot vaccination. ``All I can do  
from a leadership standpoint is say, 'Look, I've got six holes in 
my arm where I did this. I believe this is the right thing for us 
to do,''' he said.

	Clinton Mulls Serb Bombing Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the collapse of the Kosovo peace talks  
making NATO airstrikes on Serb forces more likely, the State 
Department today began evacuating the U.S. embassy in Yugoslavia 
today. President Clinton, before an afternoon news conference, laid 
out his case to congressional leaders for a massive bombing 
campaign. The Pentagon sent more warplanes to the region. ``We're 
on the brink of a very grave situation,'' House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., said after a meeting at the White House.

<HEADLINE> Cleaves, Najera Hurt in Semifinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera was knocked  
unconscious and received a concussion in a violent collision with 
Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves during the NCAA Midwest Regional 
semifinal Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Najera sustained a grade I concussion, a bruised  
breast bone and a chipped tooth as well as a cut on the chin that 
took six stitches. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, it was feared the 6-foot-8 junior had broken his jaw.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was conscious when I got to him and responsive,'' Oklahoma  
trainer Alex Brown said. ``All X-rays were negative and he will be 
further evaluated in Oklahoma tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The collision occurred as Najera set a screen in the backcourt.  
Cleaves, unaware of the screen, smashed at full speed into Najera 
and both players crumbled to the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Najera lay bleeding and unconscious on the floor for several  
minutes after Cleaves' head caught him flush on the chin. Cleaves, 
who had joked the day before that the game would be a ``good 
old-fashioned smashmouth football game,'' also lay nearly 
motionless for several minutes as Michigan State officials attended 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves returned to the game moments later but Najera, still  
woozy, went back to the lockerroom for additional treatment before 
returning to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like I ran into a brick wall,'' Cleaves said after the  
Spartans won 54-46. ``It was a blessing both guys were OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of more than 43,000 fell silent while officials  
attended to Najera and bandaged his bleeding chin. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw him on the floor, he was out,'' Oklahoma coach  
Kelvin Sampson said. ``Seeing him face down, blood coming out of 
his face, makes you realize what these kids mean to you. I wanted 
to make sure Eduardo was OK. My heart went out to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampson said the Oklahoma lockerroom was ``very emotional.''  
</P>
<P>
	`He's got a gash from one side of his chin to the other. They  
were trying to get his chin put back together,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time this year Najera had been involved in a  
violent play. During a game at Missouri, Najera swiped at the ball 
as Tigers guard Keyon Dooling went up for a layup and caught him on 
the head, knocking him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves said he was glad to see Najera get back in the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't knocked out. I was all right,'' said Cleaves, who  
returned with 6:54 remaining. Najera returned with 4:25 left.

<HEADLINE> $17.5B GOP Anti-Crime Bill Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of dollars in crime-fighting grants  
to local law enforcement would be preserved and tougher penalties 
for drug traffickers imposed under a $17.5 billion bill unveiled 
today, Senate Republicans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is based on what we know reduces crime,'' said Sen. Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch clashed with Attorney General Janet Reno last week on her  
proposal to cut several anti-crime grants from her budget proposal. 
Reno said crime was down significantly nationwide, and she wanted 
to shift money to other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hatch said Friday that crime in the United States is still  
``significantly high by historical standards,'' and violent crime 
rates here remain the highest of any industrialized nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the funding in Hatch's ``21st Century Justice Act'' is  
set aside for grant programs Reno wants eliminated, the chairman 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs in dispute are:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, which  
congressional Republicans first proposed in their 1994 election 
blueprint, the ``Contract With America.'' Since 1996, the program 
has provided more than $1 billion a year to state and local 
governments for equipment and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	--Truth-in-sentencing grants, which would give states some $700  
million a year to build prisons to house violent and repeat 
criminals for at least 85 percent of their sentences. Many states, 
Hatch said, already have changed their laws to accommodate the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant, which would  
give states $450 million a year to build detention centers, perform 
drug testing and improve record-keeping for young offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate GOP leadership sources who requested anonymity said the  
GOP bill marks a new willingness among some senior Republicans to 
take on legislative initiatives that approach the gun-control 
issue. Republicans, many of whom have opposed such legislation in 
recent years, feared they would lose such a battle after nationally 
publicized firearm tragedies at schools and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's agenda, however, faces little risk of igniting a gun  
battle because it focuses primarily on the prosecutions, GOP 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would expand a Richmond, Va., program in which the U.S.  
attorney prosecutes as many local gun-related crimes in federal 
court as possible and seeks federal mandatory minimum sentences. 
Hatch said homicides in Richmond dropped 50 percent after that 
program took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also includes a media campaign to spread the  
message that ``an illegal gun will get you five years in federal 
prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said he plans a hearing on Monday on firearms  
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Extend federal laws against the murder of state and local law  
enforcement officers to the murder by federal detainees of state 
corrections officers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Add criminal penalties for recruiting minors for ``a criminal  
street gang'' and toughen penalties for witness intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Add penalties for teaching bomb-making on the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide state and local governments the resources and authority  
to address emerging high-tech and international crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Raise penalties for powder cocaine and methamphetamine  
offenses, and make criminals liable for the cost of cleanup of 
their methamphetamine labs.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Town Pulls for Bard Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) -- This town was in love with Shakespeare long  
before there was ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland is the home of the world-renowned Oregon Shakespeare  
Festival, which draws lovers of the Bard from all across the land. 
</P>
<P>
	What's good for Shakespeare is good for Ashland, and when the  
Oscars are handed out Sunday night, many of this town's 18,500 
residents will be pulling with a passion for ``Shakespeare in 
Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If any town is in love with Shakespeare, it's this town,''  
said Les Jensen, standing at the counter of his Shakespeare &AMP; 
Company bookstore. ``We've got over 300 Shakespeare volumes. You 
have to, in this town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ashland, all the town's a stage, and the play's the thing.  
</P>
<P>
	Around this former logging town in the Siskiyou Mountains,  
strollers on Main Street can look up to see red and gold banners 
with Shakespeare's name and heraldic lions. Visitors can stay at 
the Bard's Inn, stop by Puck's Doughnuts for a snack, or get a 
boost from the All's Well Herb &AMP; Vitamin Shop. And at the Varsity 
Theater on Main, ``Shakespeare in Love'' -- the box-office smash 
with 13 Academy Award nominations -- is playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashland's love affair with all things Shakespeare began 64 years  
ago, when college teacher Angus Bowmer staged the first Oregon 
Shakespeare Festival with productions of ``Twelfth Night'' and 
``The Merchant of Venice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City fathers were so worried no one would show up for plays  
nearly 400 years old that they demanded boxing matches between 
performances to guarantee their $400 investment. 
</P>
<P>
	But all's well that ends well: People showed up -- to see the  
plays, not the boxing -- and the crowds have been coming ever since 
-- 354,147 last year, the highest in the nation for a nonprofit 
professional theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, every year, from February to November, people flock to 762  
performances of 11 plays -- four of them Shakespeare and seven 
contemporary -- at the festival's three theaters, including the 
first Elizabethan-style outdoor theater in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Such names as William Hurt, Stacy Keach and Dick Cavett have  
passed through the casts over the years, and the festival was 
honored with a Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional 
theater in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, members of the festival company have been trooping up  
Main Street for screenings of ``Shakespeare In Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it four times,'' beamed Barry Kraft, who has appeared in  
every one of Shakespeare's plays, a rare feat known as completing 
the canon. ``And I have had no disillusionment. It is able to weave 
that spell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the tale of how the Bard came to write ``Romeo and  
Juliet'' employs many of Shakespeare's dramatic themes and 
techniques: first love, mistaken identities, children going against 
the wishes of their parents, the play within a play, and the deus 
ex machina, the character who drops in out of nowhere to solve a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, the person of Shakespeare is accessible, instead of  
this old gray-headed guy on a bust,'' said festival artistic 
director Libby Appel, who is not above putting a Burger King crown 
on Henry V to reach younger audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Playgoers streaming into the Angus Bowmer Theater for a  
weeknight performance of ``Othello'' had no trouble explaining the 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of boring to read, but when you see it acted out it  
comes to life,'' said Jan Smitzer, a special education teacher who 
drove 150 miles from Eugene with her postman husband, Curt. He has 
been coming to plays here since grade school. 
</P>
<P>
	Another playgoer, retired actor Wright King of Portland, summed  
up Shakespeare's enduring appeal: ``As you get older, he gets even 
better.''

<HEADLINE> White House Attacks GOP Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the White House traded charges  
over Social Security and tax cuts as the GOP pushed a $1.74 
trillion budget for fiscal 2000 through the Senate Budget 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., shoved the package through his  
committee by an 11-9 party-line roll call vote on Thursday after 
spending two days beating back Democratic attempts to kill or 
shrink GOP tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a similar version the House Budget Committee approved on  
Wednesday, the Senate measure pledges to cut taxes by $778 billion 
over 10 years and provide more money for schools and defense while 
heeding required spending limits. It would also use Social Security 
surpluses to trim the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our priorities are very good in this budget,'' Domenici said  
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before its passage, though, Vice President Al Gore accused  
the GOP of resorting to ``Republican retronomics'' resembling 
President Reagan's budgets of the 1980s, which he said ``created 
the deepest recession since the Great Depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have said Republicans would do nothing to reinforce  
Social Security and Medicare for the baby boomers' retirements and 
would bestow overly large tax cuts and force deep spending cuts -- 
all the while imperiling the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican plan puts risky tax schemes first and Social  
Security last,'' Gore told black newspaper publishers visiting the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said it was President Clinton, who would give  
Treasury bonds to the Social Security trust funds, who was not 
helping that program or Medicare. By proposing to reserve 77 
percent of surpluses over the next 15 years for those two programs, 
the president was merely trying to prevent Republicans from cutting 
taxes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has handed over the budget situation to the next  
election,'' Domenici told reporters. ``Instead of trying to get 
things done, they're trying to electioneer for Vice President Gore 
already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional budget provides lawmakers with overall tax and  
spending limits for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, but leaves 
decisions on specifics for future bills. It does not require the 
president's signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Before approving Domenici's budget, Sen. Christopher Bond,  
R-Mo., tweaked Democrats by forcing the panel to vote on the budget 
Clinton proposed last month. It was rejected 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they support the main principle of the  
president's budget: reserving most of the surplus for Social 
Security and Medicare. But with the two parties competing this year 
over protecting Social Security, they were reluctant to vote for 
the Clinton plan because it would allow some Social Security funds 
to be spent for domestic programs in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House and Senate are expected to approve both budgets  
next week and pass a compromise plan next month. In the months to 
come, though, the Republicans and the president seem certain to 
battle over spending and tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate continued to debate a $1.9 billion  
spending bill containing funds for Central American countries 
battered by Hurricane Mitch and other natural disasters, for U.S. 
farmers and for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators killed two amendments that would have told states how  
to spend their tobacco settlement money and cut off funding to 
prosecutor Kenneth Starr and other independent counsel probes. 
</P>
<P>
	By 79-21, the Senate rejected an amendment by Sen. Arlen  
Specter, R-Pa., that would have required states to spend 50 percent 
of the money they receive from their settlement with tobacco 
companies on health related matters. 
</P>
<P>
	On voice vote, senators rejected an amendment by Democratic  
senators that would have stopped federal funding to Starr and four 
other independent counsels six months if the statute providing for 
their jobs expires June 30.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Rail Car Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- It's back to Plan B for all who loved  
the idea of a separate railroad car for cell phone users. 
</P>
<P>
	``After closer scrutiny, the railroad decided it was  
impractical,'' Marjorie Anders, spokeswoman for the New York area 
commuter line Metro-North, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad, which serves New York's northern suburbs, said  
Monday that it might designate separate cars for telephone talkers 
because of complaints that they were shouting into their phones, 
disturbing other riders' work, conversation or daydreams. 
</P>
<P>
	But even for the brief time the idea was under consideration,  
the railroad knew it faced formidable obstacles -- free speech 
issues, overcrowding, accessibility for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	And a phone company attorney sarcastically suggested separate  
cars for people with head colds, hair spray or cheap after-shave. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those things about modern society that we are  
going to have to adjust to,'' Anders said. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman complained to the railroad after finding herself  
surrounded by five people on cell phones. Another passenger 
resorted to turning on a tape recorder in front of a lawyer who was 
talking loudly to clients, telling the lawyer, ``Your 
attorney-client privilege is no longer privileged.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake To Unveil Olympic Mascot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The scandal-delayed unveiling of the  
mascot for the 2002 Winter Games has been set for May 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee had planned to unveil the  
mascot on Feb. 8, but didn't like the mood brought on by the 
allegations that Salt Lake organizers provided $1 million in cash, 
scholarships and gifts to IOC members to win the event. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC president Mitt Romney on Thursday declined to say whether  
the mascot was one or more characters. But he suggested that rather 
than cute and cuddly, the mascot ``embodies the spirit of the 
American West and Utah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mascot is to be launched at an evening community  
celebration, with the 1,000-day countdown to the Winter Games 
starting at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC expects $52 million in revenue from licensed products, a  
big chunk of which are clothes, trinkets, pins and toys bearing the 
image of the mascot. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came at a press conference when Romney returned  
from Lausanne, Switzerland, where he met Tuesday with leaders of 
the IOC dealing with the worst corruption crisis in Olympic 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC voted to oust six members who accepted hundreds of  
thousands of dollars in gifts, cash and freebies from the Salt Lake 
City bid committee. Four members resigned earlier in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he didn't ``blurt out the truth'' that the SLOC  
plans to cut back on what it spends to host the IOC in 2002. 
``They're going to find out we can be frugal and still 
hospitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said what he did cover was the urgent need for the IOC,  
working with the SLOC, to sign up a computer hardware sponsor to 
work with Sema, the European consortium managing information 
technologies for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He also sought the IOC's help in identifying how the SLOC can  
make cutbacks in its $1.5 billion budget and asked for prompt, 
thorough reform that will satisfy sponsors skittish about the value 
of the scandal-tarnished Olympic rings. The SLOC needs to raise 
$288 million more from sponsors to finance its budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney lauded the reforms approved by the IOC on Thursday -- a  
change in the selection process for the 2006 Winter Games and 
special commissions to police members and reform the IOC -- and said 
he hopes to see more. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney predicted Utah companies that ``believe we've turned the  
corner'' will be the first to sign up as new sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two executives of the SLOC resigned in January, and the  
former president who had led the bid committee was stripped of his 
pension. In February, the committee hired Romney and restructured 
to expand community representation and endorsed policies for more 
open records, meetings and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Justice is investigating the scandal for  
possible criminal violations. 
</P>
<P>
	It expects to conclude the probe in June, The Salt Lake Tribune  
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we are still investigating on the ground in Salt  
Lake City, and we have people here in Washington, D.C., that are 
part of that team,'' said Brian Steel, a spokesperson for the 
Department of Justice. ``We are proceeding with all deliberate 
speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Justice prosecutors are interested in how  
former SLOC President Tom Welch arranged payments to ARCA, a 
company run by Alfredo La Mont, a Colorado Springs consultant who 
resigned as USOC director of international relations under 
conflict-of-interest accusations. Before October 1995, Salt Lake's 
bid committee made six payments totaling $18,185.90 to ARCA. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the SLOC ethics committee, La Mont and ARCA  
subsequently made monthly payments of $3,000 to Austin Sealy, an 
IOC member from Barbados. 
</P>
<P>
	Also still of interest to federal investigators is the  
``Claudet'' account that Welch and Jean-Claude Ganga, the ousted 
IOC member from the Republic of Congo, established at West One Bank 
in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also received $70,010 from SLOC that was deposited into  
another account, this one at First Security Bank, according to a 
report by the IOC. At issue is how the money was transferred into 
the account, for what reason and where it went after it was 
deposited. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney acknowledged the possibility that criminal charges could  
result from the Department of Justice probe, casting an even darker 
shadow over the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``I'm committed -- whatever the fickle finger of  
fate dishes out -- we'll be able to host great games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said he doubts Congress would take action that would hurt  
the 2002 Winter Games, although they may change how the IOC is 
treated by U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe Senator McCain or anyone else wants to  
jeopardize the ... opportunity for youth in America to take part in 
great Olympics,'' Romney said. ``Every senator recognizes this is 
one of the few opportunities to advocate peace in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has warned the IOC it may be in for  
rough treatment. On Thursday, he said the new measures ``fall short 
of the reforms needed to bring transparency and accountability to 
the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain will open Senate hearings April 14 on the Olympic  
scandal. Senators are proposing legislation to strip the IOC of its 
tax-exempt status, limit sponsors' tax deductions and reroute U.S. 
TV rights money to the U.S. Olympic Committee.

<HEADLINE> Montoya Ready for CART Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Some people expect Juan Montoya to become  
the new Wonder Boy of the CART FedEx Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Colombian, whose debut will come Sunday in the  
season-opening Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami, says he feels no need 
to replace two-time series champion Alex Zanardi in the hearts of 
open-wheel fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just having fun,'' said Montoya, last year's European  
Formula 3000 series champion and test driver for the Williams 
Formula One team. ``Everyone is taking the pressure off me. 
Everybody says don't worry, just go out and get experience. 
Actually, I try to worry because I want to do well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says just go out and finish in the top 10, get some  
time in the car, get some points. But it's tough because I want to 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has stepped into some big shoes, following Zanardi at  
Target-Chip Ganassi Racing and joining former champion Jimmy Vasser 
with the team aiming for its fourth straight PPG Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, trained on the road courses of South America and  
Europe, did run in the American Barber-Saab series in 1994, winning 
two races and finishing third in the points. Sunday's race will be 
his first race on an oval in a front line car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is different here -- the ovals, the cars, the power.  
Until I race, I can't know how much the driver and the car can do, 
or how little,'' he said. ``But I know the team is capable of 
winning. Now is my time to begin to show what I can do. I am 
excited about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he is nervous, Montoya said, ``Not yet. But on Sunday I  
will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya showed some speed on Friday, the first official day of  
practice for Sunday's race. He was fourth over the two sessions in 
his primary car, turning a fast lap of 211.715 mph, and was 13th in 
his backup Reynard-Honda at 209.622. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrian Fernandez, who finished sixth here last year in his debut  
with Patrick Racing, was fastest Friday at 213.218 in one of last 
year's Reynards. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Racing decided over the winter to switch from Reynard to  
Swift chassis, but wound up switching back to their old Reynards 
after problems arose with the new cars during testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's amazing,'' Fernandez said. ``We haven't done anything  
to it. That's the same car that we won Japan and Mid-Ohio with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say anything about the '99 (Reynard) car because I  
haven't driven it, but for sure the new cars are very similar right 
now. And we're very lucky the Ford engines go into the new cars the 
same way and haven't been changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dario Franchitti, one of the favorites to win the series title,  
was second to Fernandez at 211.218 in a new Reynard powered by a 
Honda engine, while Patrick Carpentier was third at 211.740 in 
another new Reynard with a Mercedes engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Moore, who won the pole for last year's race with a  
track-record 217.541, was fifth in practice at 211.657. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying for Sunday's race will be held Saturday on the  
1 1/2-mile track, with nobody expected to approach Moore's mark, 
thanks to gusty wind and the addition of NASCAR's Craftsman Truck 
Series to the CART weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trucks run a much different line than we do,'' Carpentier  
said. ``Running over the rubber they've left on the track makes our 
car feel real nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truck race, the Florida Dodge Dealers 400, will be run  
Saturday following the CART qualifying.

<HEADLINE> Dow Kisses 10,000 Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It would be hard to find a much better launching  
pad for 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average teased investors Thursday with  
a late bid at history, bobbing above 10,000 six separate times in 
the final 10 minutes of trading, only to creep back below and 
finish just 2.68 points beneath the vaunted milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the disappointment was another new high for the Dow,  
which rose 118.12 points for the day to close at a record 9,997.62. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also closed at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday  
morning, but pulled back after about a minute and closed with a 
loss. Thursday's high was 10,001.51, a shade below Tuesday's high 
of 10,001.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's last-minute flirtation with 10,000 sparked some  
confusion at the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
NYSE Chairman Richard A. Grasso and Dow Jones &AMP; Co. chief executive 
Peter Kann began celebrating too soon -- flinging baseball caps 
emblazoned with the words ``Dow 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 800 points, or nearly 9 percent, in 1999 --  
well on the way to what would be an unprecedented fifth straight 
year with a gain of at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While just a number, 10,000 would mark a crowning achievement  
for a resilient bull market that began more than eight years ago, 
on Oct. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has more than quadrupled since that time, driven by an  
extraordinary combination of positive factors, especially tame 
inflation, low interest rates, and a confident mood that has 
consumers buying everything from stocks to socks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main spark for Thursday's advance was a report that consumer  
prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month -- further confirmation 
that inflation remains in check and that the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing perception that the world's economic trouble spots are  
recovering has provided some extra fuel in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, investors were unfazed Thursday by a separate report  
from the Commerce Department showing that the nation's trade 
deficit shot up 21 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Improves, Takes Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is  
recovering from prostate cancer treatment and a case of flu and 
will take a four-month sabbatical from leading his group, his 
personal physician said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minister's life is not in imminent danger from any medical  
cause,'' Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should serve notice to all of the vultures who are  
hovering over what they expect to be a dead carcass that you can go 
home,'' he said. ``There is no death vigil. This is no death 
watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was first treated for prostate cancer in 1991.  
His most recent treatment, combined with two recent bouts of the 
flu, anemia and his hectic schedule, left him in need of a break, 
Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no sign of cancer in his body except in the  
prostate and a nearby sac. ``Some of you who have black hair now -- 
your hair will be silver before he leaves the scene,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was not at the news conference. The Muslim group's  
leaders, citing security concerns, declined to disclose his 
location beyond saying that he is not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about Farrakhan's health began after the Nation of  
Islam's newspaper, The Final Call, reported Farrakhan had fallen 
ill in early January with an undiagnosed condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was quoted as saying the current illness ``took me  
down so fast, that it concerned me greatly because, though I'm 
nearing 66, I have never been sick like this in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a Feb. 28 speech in Chicago, Farrakhan said he lost 20  
pounds and most of his muscle mass in less than two weeks and had 
``no appetite, night sweats, dealing with the after-effects of 
radiation therapy (for prostate cancer) and other things,'' the 
newspaper reported in a March 10 update on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has often sparked controversy with his outspoken  
support of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he has visited 
several times, and his negative comments about Jews, Christians, 
white people and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan reportedly was treated for prostate cancer by  
Gadhafi's doctors after announcing he had the illness in 1991. He 
most recently met with Gadhafi in November -- his fifth visit to 
Libya in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	His personal physician, however, denied at today's news  
conference that Farrakhan had ever been treated for cancer in 
Libya. He said that normal tests in connection with his cancer 
treatment were performed at a hospital in Tripoli while Farrakhan 
was on a world tour.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Good Outweighs Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a scandal-scarred year, President  
Clinton says he and his wife Hillary are ``working hard'' on their 
relationship and ``we love each other very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the box score of his presidency will show ``one  
negative'' when he lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
against ``hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times'' when he did 
``not abuse my authority as president, that I was truthful with the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered his accounting Friday at an hour-long news  
conference, his first full-scale question-and-answer session at the 
White House in nearly a year. The primary topics were the prospect 
of military action against the Serbs and suspicions that China 
stole nuclear secrets from U.S. nuclear laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said NATO must be prepared to carry out airstrikes  
against Serbs because ``hesitation is a license to kill.'' And he 
said the Serbs already had crossed the threshold that warrants 
military actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defended his administration's handling of China's  
suspected theft of secrets from U.S. nuclear labs in the 1980s. He 
also said, ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything 
to me about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the 
labs during my presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also was asked about impeachment, the loyalty of former aides  
who have written tell-all books and allegations that he sexually 
assaulted an Arkansas woman 21 years ago when he was the state's 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney has denied the assault allegation, and Clinton  
said, ``He speaks for me. I think he spoke quite clearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton refused to discuss his personal reflections about his  
bitterly partisan impeachment ordeal or comment on whether he feels 
resentment or relief. ``It's best for me not to focus on that now. 
I think it's best for me to focus on my job. I have nearly two 
years to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a questioner pinned him down about ``what your legacy will  
be about lying'' and the importance of telling the truth. After 
initially denying that he had an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton 
acknowledged last year that they had a sexual relationship and that 
he had lied about it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the lesson for young people will be that even presidents  
have to tell the truth and there are consequences when they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also think that there will be a box score,'' he said,  
``and there will be that one negative and then there will be the 
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times when the record will 
show that I did not abuse my authority as president, that I was 
truthful with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Clinton said that ``scores and scores of allegations  
were made against me and widely publicized without any regard to 
whether they were true or not. Most of them have already been 
actually proved false. And it's very hard to disprove every false 
allegation against you. But we have had more success, frankly, than 
I was afraid we would when we started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he and Mrs. Clinton are ``working hard'' on repairing  
their relationship and that, ``We love each other very much.'' He 
said he had not a clue whether she would run for a U.S. Senate seat 
from New York -- but added pointedly that the first lady had 
suggested they move there when he leaves the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The president chuckled when a reporter asked why people ``have  
been so mean to you. Is it a conspiracy, is it a plan?'' He said 
that despite all his troubles, ``I have been very blessed in my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to criticize former senior aide George  
Stephanopoulos, now a television commentator, and former political 
adviser Dick Morris for writing books that reveal insider secrets 
and their personal feelings about Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't read either of the books or even any articles about  
it,'' he said. But he said he valued the loyalty and service he has 
received ``from the overwhelming majority'' of people who have 
worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The president reserved special praise for Vice President Al  
Gore, tweaked by Republicans for his claims that he invented the 
Internet and spent his boyhood plowing hills in Tennessee. He said 
it's a challenge for any politician to promote himself without 
overdoing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be happy to toot his horn ... because there's no question  
that he has been integral to all the good things that have happened 
in this administration,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other personnel matters, he said he has not talked with  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about whether to reappoint 
him to another term. He also said he has not talked with Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin about his future, although rumors that Rubin 
is about to leave shake Wall Street from time to time.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators now must produce  
compromise legislation to commit the United States to a national 
defense against a limited ballistic missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Thursday approved its version 317-105, a day after  
the Senate passed similar legislation 97-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House once threatened to veto the legislation -- long a  
GOP priority and part of the Republicans' 1994 ``Contract With 
America.'' But members of the Clinton administration no longer are 
talking that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they plan to monitor a House-Senate conference  
committee that will come up with the final version, in hopes the 
finished product will more closely resemble the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China were quick to criticize Congress' action.  
</P>
<P>
	``That poses a serious threat to the whole process of nuclear  
arms control, as well as strategic stability, for which major 
international agreements have been worked out for decades,'' the 
Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the  
measure is counterproductive for arms control and disarmament and 
will ``have an impact on global strategic balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a bill to become law, both chambers of Congress must pass  
identically worded legislation, which the president must sign. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration favors the Senate bill because it promotes  
continued negotiations with Moscow to reduce nuclear warheads and 
stresses that missile-defense funds must be reviewed annually by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also states that the missile defense be deployed  
``as soon as technologically possible,'' a phrase not included in 
the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure is but 15 words: ``It is the official policy  
of the United States to deploy a national missile defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a deceptively simple bill. But it speaks volumes to the  
entire planet that we will not shy away from the challenge to make 
the United States and its people safe from ballistic missile 
attack,'' Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House 
intelligence committee, said during House debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no defense today against any missile system. It is a  
national priority that this Congress needs to address,'' Rep. Curt 
Weldon, R-Pa., chief sponsor of the legislation, told colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton vetoed a similar measure in 1995 and Democratic leaders  
previously opposed a commitment to such a system. But lawmakers 
from both parties said recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran 
and reports of nuclear weapons espionage by China helped rally huge 
support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Senate bill, the House measure envisions a scaled-back  
version of the Strategic Defense Initiative proposed in 1983 by 
then-President Ronald Reagan -- and derided by Democrats as ``Star 
Wars'' -- for a space-based defense against ballistic missile 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	While that plan was geared mainly at the former Soviet Union,  
the system now being promoted deals more with an accidental launch 
-- or by the deliberate launch by a rogue or terrorist state. It 
would not be space-based. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has spent over $50 billion on research and limited  
tests on such a system, even though one still has not been 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	The president put $10.5 billion in his budget for such a program  
over the next five years -- an increase of $6.6 billion -- but wanted 
to wait until June 2000 before deciding whether to actually deploy 
such a system.

<HEADLINE> Roughhousing Leads To Fatal Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A software salesman who plunged to his death  
from the 12th floor of his company's offices was pushed by a 
colleague during a party, investigators said Friday. A company 
executive said the men were roughhousing while celebrating a 
business success. 
</P>
<P>
	No immediate charges were filed. Police and prosecutors are  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The salesman, 36-year-old Douglas R. Buchholz, worked for  
Sterling Commerce, in the General Motors building. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cause of death was homicide. He was pushed,'' said Ellen  
Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The death happened as employees celebrated recent success in  
business, said the company's chief executive, Warner C. Blow. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that the two people involved were  
horseplaying in the office and that one of them ended up out the 
window,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times quoted an unidentified security consultant  
for the building as saying ``a tremendous amount of alcohol'' was 
found in the office. He said a group of employees started drinking 
beer at lunch to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and continued their 
party back at the office. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultant said four workers were in the office when  
Buchholz and a colleague began to wrestle. He said Buchholz pushed 
a colleague so hard that the man's body left an imprint on a 
Sheetrock wall. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the colleague then pushed Buchholz, described as burly  
and weighing 200 pounds, against a window, shattering the safety 
glass.

<HEADLINE> Duke Wears Down SW Missouri State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- This is how good Duke has been  
playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Blue Devils finished the first 20 minutes against  
Southwest Missouri State in Friday night's NCAA East regional up by 
just nine points, coach Mike Krzyzewski was a little disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	So the nation's No. 1 team turned up the intensity a notch or  
two and came away with 78-62 victory, a game in which coach K 
couldn't say enough about the other guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played great,'' he said of SMS. ``They played really good  
defense. They have good hands. They're always after it, chasing 
loose balls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, the Bears still lost by 16.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're a very good offensive team, the way they run their  
motion,'' Krzyzewski continued. ``They get a lot of touches. They 
don't turn it over much. We couldn't get them to turn it over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, Duke never trailed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're a confident team,'' coach K said. ``That's why they  
beat Wisconsin and why they beat Tennessee by 30. Their team played 
great against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All very nice but it didn't mean much in the long run for the  
Bears, who were in as trifle too deep against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Alford knew his team needed a nearly perfect game to  
compete with the Blue Devils. What he got was a somewhat imperfect 
one. SMS shot just 37 percent and that simply wasn't enough against 
Duke's relentless attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Anytime Duke needed a basket, it was able to get one, if not  
from Trajan Langdon outside, then from Elton Brand inside. If not 
from William Avery, then from Chris Carrawell. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Duke got some lecturing from Krzyzewski at halftime.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been playing great basketball, unusually great  
basketball,'' he said. ``I thought we started ... we didn't get a 
loose ball. If we pick it up, we get a score. Instead, they pick it 
up and get a score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that Duke was ever in trouble against SMS. It's just  
that the Blue Devils have grown accustomed to blowouts in this 35-1 
season. They hadn't scored fewer than 80 points since December. 
They hadn't won by less than 10 since January. 
</P>
<P>
	So in the second half, when a Duke player found himself  
surrounded by three SMS players in a loose ball scramble, coach K 
jumped to his feet. ``We've got four timeouts,'' he called to his 
team, a reminder to play smart basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the urgency?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're usually up by 30 at that point,'' Krzyzewski said.  
``We've got to get back to clipping coupons and shopping sales.''

<HEADLINE> Miami, Ohio Has Daunting Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This time, Miami of Ohio gets a chance to  
eliminate the other half of last season's NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Under normal circumstances, the prospect of taking on defending  
champion Kentucky in the Midwest Regional semifinals would be 
daunting. But after knocking off Utah, the No. 2 seed, the 
10th-seeded Mid-American Conference champions aren't exactly in awe 
of tonight's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad's always said this: Every game starts at zero and each  
team has the same opportunity to win,'' Miami star Wally Szczerbiak 
said. ``The aura Kentucky has, it's really no different from the 
aura Utah had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not this year, considering that Kentucky (27-8) is the No.  
3 seed. But don't forget to factor in the rich tournament heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats have been in the national title game the last three  
years. They've been to 40 NCAA tournaments, more than any other 
team, and this is their fifth straight appearance in the round of 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact we've been here and been so successful gives us  
confidence,'' forward Scott Padgett said. ``At this time of the 
year, we know what it takes to win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky also has won 17 in a row against Miami, with the last  
loss in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kentucky expects to get at least this far every year,  
Miami (24-7) is hitting a rare high note. Coach Charlie Coles' team 
has tied the school record for victories, is in the round of 16 for 
the first time since 1978 and has never made it to the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said somebody has made a big mistake if he and Kentucky  
coach Tubby Smith ever end up in the same place checking out 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never really cross paths,'' Coles said. ``If I see Tubby  
out recruiting someone, then I'm in the wrong gym. Nothing against 
our players, but that's just the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That even goes for Szczerbiak, the tournament darling and likely  
NBA lottery pick who has 67 points in Miami's first two NCAA 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't recruited by Kentucky at all,'' said Szczerbiak, who  
averages 24.3 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith isn't to blame, since this is his second season with the  
Wildcats. Still, it made him wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are a lot of great players who've fallen  
through,'' Smith said. ``It can happen. But in this day, it's hard 
to imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak carried Miami in the tourney-opening victory over  
seventh-seeded Washington, scoring 43 of the team's 59 points. 
Miami proved it's not a one-man team against Utah, winning 66-58 
even though Szczerbiak was held to 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Against Utah, I don't think I had a superhuman effort,''  
Szczerbiak said. ``Other guys stepped up and did the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami likely will need more performances like John Estick's  
season-best 18 points against Utah against a Kentucky team known 
for its bottomless bench. Four players average in double figures 
and Smith routinely substitutes for the entire starting five after 
the first four or five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett leads the team with 12.5 points and six rebounds a game,  
modest totals because of Kentucky's depth. Heshimu Evans averages 
11.8 points and five rebounds, Wayne Turner 10.7 points and 3.8 
assists and Michael Bradley 10.3 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky has held opponents to 37.9 percent shooting, the best  
at the school since 1962, and hopes to frustrate Szczerbiak as 
well. Smith said the best way to do that is to wear him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak's response: good luck. He averages about three  
minutes of bench time per game and has played every minute of the 
tournament so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like this is going to be our first 40-minute game,''  
Szczerbiak said. ``We've been doing this just about every time.''

<HEADLINE> Domingo Triumphs in New Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's been quite a week for aging tenors at the  
Metropolitan Opera. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Luciano Pavarotti returned in Puccini's ``Tosca,''  
sounding in better voice at age 63 than he had in several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Then two nights later, Placido Domingo, a mere 58, scored a  
triumph as he sang the part of Ghermann in Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of 
Spades'' for the first time -- the 112th role of his amazing career. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Thursday's revival of the Russian masterpiece was a  
one-man show. The Met's revival of Elijah Moshinsky's superb 1995 
production was strongly cast down to the most minor roles. And with 
Valery Gergiev again conducting, the orchestra played with dazzling 
virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tchaikovsky's opera, adapted from Pushkin, tells of Ghermann, an  
impoverished army engineer, who becomes obsessed with forcing an 
old countess to divulge a magic formula for winning at cards. 
Trying to learn her secret, he ends up frightening her to death and 
destroying the life of her granddaughter, Lisa, with whom he has 
carried on an affair. 
</P>
<P>
	The role of Ghermann is a daunting one, filled with sustained  
high notes and requiring an actor who can make convincing the 
character's descent into madness and eventual suicide. Domingo rose 
to the challenge admirably. His voice sounded strong and sure 
throughout the long night, and his portrayal was harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lisa, soprano Galina Gorchakova brought great artistry to the  
part of an impetuous young girl caught in the snares of a passion 
beyond her control. Her great third-act aria of despair was deeply 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a treat having baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky return in the  
relatively small role of Prince Yeletsky, Lisa's jilted suitor. He 
has one big moment -- his second-act aria, set to one of 
Tchaikovsky's most haunting melodies -- and his burnished tone made 
it memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Mezzo Olga Borodina nearly stole the show as Lisa's friend,  
Pauline. She has the wide range required for the melancholy ballad 
she sings to their friends, and she has the charm and lightness to 
pull off her part as the faithful shepherd in the pastoral 
opera-within-the-opera that is performed for the guests in the 
ballroom scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo wasn't the only old-timer in the cast. The crucial role  
of the countess was taken by Elisabeth Soederstrom, returning to 
the Met at age 71 -- some 12 years after she gave her ``farewell'' 
performance as the Marschallin in Richard Strauss' ``Der 
Rosenkavalier.'' She brought great dignity and even humor to the 
part, making her a less fearsome but more sympathetic character 
than she sometimes seems. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Domingo, he shows no signs of slowing down. Next fall  
he'll open the Met season in Leoncavallo's ``I Pagliacci,'' and it 
will be his 18th opening night -- breaking the record he currently 
shares with Enrico Caruso.

<HEADLINE> Trench Coat Robber Gets 24 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TACOMA, Wash. (AP) -- A man convicted in the biggest bank robbery  
in U.S. history was sentenced today to 24 years and seven months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Franklin D. Burgess also ordered Ray Lewis Bowman, 54, of  
Parkville, Mo., to pay $5.2 million and to forfeit 112 guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman was convicted in November of bank robbery, conspiracy to  
commit bank robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of a crime 
and transporting stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	He had faced a maximum 30 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	The trial centered on the Feb. 10, 1997, robbery of nearly $4.5  
million -- approximately 335 pounds of cash -- from the Seafirst bank 
branch in suburban Lakewood. The U.S. attorney's office said it was 
the biggest U.S. bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleged that from 1982 to 1997, Bowman and  
William Arthur Kirkpatrick of Hovland, Minn., pulled off 28 bank 
robberies that netted more than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In most of the jobs, the robbers wore disguises, including  
trench coats, which gave rise to the name Trench Coat Robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the pair would slip into banks, often at  
opening or closing, surprise employees and quickly make off with 
large amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against Kirkpatrick in the Lakewood robbery were dropped  
last year after a judge ruled a 1997 search of Kirkpatrick by a 
Nebraska state trooper was illegally conducted. Kirkpatrick still 
faces trial for the 1993 robbery of First Bank in Burnsville, 
Minn., and is charged with eight counts of money laundering.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Clings to 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average hovered above  
the 10,000 mark today as an early rally was deflated by weakness in 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 9.71 at 10,007.33. The  
index of blue chips soared nearly 88 points in the first hour of 
trading before sinking steadily throughout the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is struggling to extend its stay above the vaunted  
10,000 milestone for more than a few moments. On Thursday, the 
Dow's 118.21-point gain was nearly overlooked as the index made six 
dramatic bounces above 10,000 in the final minutes of trading. 
Thursday's close left the Dow at a record high of 9,997.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Dow component General Electric led the blue chips higher  
after a Lehman Brothers analyst issued a favorable report on its 
international growth prospects. Its shares rose 2 5/8 to 112 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also appeared to benefit from the volatility that  
accompanied a ``triple witching'' session. Today is one of four 
days during the year when contracts on stock options, index 
options, and index futures all expire. Triple witching typically 
adds volatility as portfolio managers rush to buy or sell stocks to 
square their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks introduced some weakness to the market. IBM  
fell 3 3/8 to 174 3/16. Analysts have begun questioning the strength 
of computer makers' earnings for the nearly completed quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks,  
reversed early gains and was down 9.60 at 2,453.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which has set its own string of  
records in recent weeks, also slipped after a strong morning, and 
was off 0.91 at 1,315.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a robust 479.2 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 1.16 to 616.45, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.56 at 713.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets around the world flourished following the Dow's strong  
rally on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei index soared 4.2 higher to its 
best finish since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading in Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 2.5  
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.2 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wreck Kills Two; Scatters Dimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GORE, Okla. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer rig carrying 8 million  
newly minted dimes ran off Interstate 40 early today and burst into 
flames. Two people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The $800,000 in dimes lay scattered around the wreckage of the  
truck, which investigators said was traveling from Denver to the 
Federal Reserve Bank in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. Jack Rosenberg said the accident  
happened about 6:30 a.m. when the American Armored Transport truck 
veered off the road, hit an embankment and went airborne before 
striking a second embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of Jason C. White, 25, of Mount Pleasant, Texas, and  
passenger Danial J. Moore, 25, of Chandler, Texas, were found in 
the burned cab. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers believe the driver fell asleep.  
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said the bags of dimes went flying upon impact. ``It's  
a mess,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service took over the accident scene and planned to  
scoop up the dimes so they can be cleaned and reissued.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Market's Key Index Recovers / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index recovered to  
an eight-month high on a rally in blue chips today, rebounding from 
the previous day's sharp drop. The dollar slid against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.52 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.00  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 117.45 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 660.86  
points, or 4.20 percent, closing the week at 16,378.78 points -- its 
highest close since July 31. On Thursday, the average closed down 
550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, after hitting an eight-month high 
on Wednesday. Today's high was just a tick above that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	While today's rally was partially in reaction to Thursday's  
sharp drop, traders said investors were encouraged by continued 
corporate restructuring by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors were large net buyers on the growing view that  
Japan's economy may have hit bottom, traders said. The rise in New 
York stocks overnight was another bullish factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 six times  
Thursday before closing at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 867  
million shares, down from Thursday's turnover of 1.30 billion 
shares. Advances outnumbered retreats 899 to 314, with 111 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among today's gainers were blue chips, including Sony Corp.,  
Toyota Motor Corp. and Kyocera. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 38.52 points, or 3.13 percent, to 1,269.76. 
The TOPIX lost 28.85 points, or 2.29 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slid as overseas investors  
bought yen to invest in rising Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just short-term foreign speculators but also  
long-term investors such as U.S. mutual and pension funds who are 
selling dollars for yen to invest in Japanese stocks,'' said Shuji 
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But other players retreated to the sidelines prior to a  
three-day weekend in Japan. The dollar ranged between 116.90 yen 
and 117.80 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Monday, March 22, for  
Spring Equinox Day, a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.36 yen, down  
from 130.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.665 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.685 percent, 
driving its price up 101.08 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Same Spot, New Site for Tar Heels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- North Carolina has been in this position  
before in the NCAA women's basketball tournament. Only the location 
has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar Heels are about to face the nation's No. 1 team in an  
arena filled with opposing fans. And this time, the Tar Heels are 
determined to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina (28-7) meets Purdue (30-1) on Saturday night in  
the semifinals of the Midwest Regional. The game comes one year 
after the Tar Heels almost pulled a huge upset, leading by 12 with 
7 1/2 minutes left before losing to Tennessee 76-70 in the Mideast 
Regional finals in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt's Memorial Gym was filled with orange-clad Tennessee  
fans that night, just as Purdue will have thousands of fans at 
Redbird Arena, only 2 1/2 hours from the Purdue campus. Having 
experienced what they did last year, the Tar Heels feel they'll be 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to help us a lot,'' sophomore guard Nikki Teasley  
said. ``We've been in this situation before. They're not that far 
from their hometown, they're going to have a large crowd. I have 
confidence in myself and my teammates that we won't make that same 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Sylvia Hatchell is happy that a team so young is getting  
this chance. The team's top three scorers, Teasley, Juana Brown and 
LaQuanda Barksdale, are sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really thinking these kids are motivated for the  
opportunity they have,'' Hatchell said. `They got a taste of it 
last year and they know how close they came. So I'm hoping they're 
going to want it a little bit more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue, which has won 28 straight, also reached the regional  
finals last year and lost to Louisiana Tech. But coach Carolyn Peck 
questions whether that has any bearing on what's happening now.

	``The way we look at things, we can't take any points or any  
steals from games that happened in the past,'' Peck said. ``Yeah, 
that probably will be in their minds, but that doesn't affect this 
game. You've still got to step out on the floor. You've got to play 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Tech (30-3) plays Rutgers (28-5) in the second game  
Saturday night. The winners meet Monday night to decide who goes to 
the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard play will be the focus in the opener. Purdue's offense  
revolves around Stephanie White-McCarty, a unanimous All-American, 
Ukari Figgs and Katie Douglas. North Carolina counters with Teasley 
and Brown, who lead a fastbreaking team that averages 82.6 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue shot only 36 percent in its victories over Oral Roberts  
and Kansas in the first two rounds but allowed just 48 and 41 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter how well you shoot the ball if you play  
tough defense,'' Peck said. ``We did that. People talk about it 
being an ugly game, it might be when you look at it from the 
offensive side. We look at the total package and defensively, it 
was a very balanced effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second game sends Big 12 champion Texas Tech against one of  
the nation's best defensive teams. Rutgers is allowing only 55.6 
points a game and nothing gives the Scarlet Knights a bigger charge 
than shutting down an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wants to be scored on and we all look at it as if our  
player gets the ball, they're not going to score,'' guard Tomora 
Young said. ``We're not even going to let our player get the ball. 
If everybody on our team has that attitude, it's kind of tough for 
anyone to execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tech's offense starts with center Angie Braziel, a second-team  
All-American who averages 20.7 points. But the Lady Raiders also 
have outstanding perimeter shooters in Rene Hanebutt and Julie Lake 
to keep the heat off Braziel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's important for us to shoot the ball well early so  
our post players can go 1-on-1 to the basket,'' Hanebutt said.

	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Mike Jarvis had actually recommended  
someone else for the head coaching vacancy at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lou Carnesecca, the former Red Storm coach who helped in the  
search last year, apparently wasn't listening when Jarvis talked 
about Bill Herrion, his former assistant who is the Drexel head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lou wears a hearing aid ... I think he turned it off for an  
hour when I was talking to him about Bill,'' Jarvis said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of days later, he called me back, and said he didn't  
want to talk about Bill,'' Jarvis said. ``He wanted to know if I 
was interested in the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis, who had been at George Washington for eight seasons,  
said he wasn't interested and hung up the phone. His wife Connie 
had different ideas, telling her husband to call Carnesecca back. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started to talk, one thing led to another and before you  
know it I'm at the press conference,'' Jarvis said. ``I'm glad I 
listened to my wife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm (28-8) play in the NCAA South Regional final  
Saturday against Ohio State (26-8) for a spot in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't know how we are having this season,'' Jarvis  
said. ``With a seven-year contract, you go into job with a 
different feeling ... I thought I'd be patient, try to teach the 
best I could and build a solid foundation. And I prayed for more 
patience.''

	 *GOOD TIMING:* Having lived in Columbus, Ohio, his entire life,  
Michael Redd has seen the good and bad of Ohio State basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore guard is happy to be part of the current  
turnaround -- from an 8-22 season last year to within a victory of 
the Final Four. But he remembers when things weren't so good. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to have been in Columbus all of my life. It  
made me glad that I made the choice to go to Ohio State and see the 
turnaround the last two years,'' said Redd, who is averaging 21 
points a game after 64 college games.

	 *SOUTH'S TOP FAILURES:* Since the NCAA tournament was expanded  
to 64 teams in 1985, no No. 1 seed from the South has won the 
national championship. And it won't happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn became the first No. 1 seed to fall in this year's  
tourney after a 72-64 loss to Ohio State in a South Regional 
semifinal Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 15 top seeds from the South (or Southeast Regional as it  
was known from 1985-97), only Kentucky and Oklahoma have reached 
the Final Four. The Wildcats lost in a 1993 national semifinal game 
and the Sooners lost to Kansas in the 1988 NCAA title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other No. 1s from the South made it to the regional  
finals, but Auburn became the fifth to be stopped trying to get 
past the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The only South No. 1 not to make it to the regional semifinals  
was Michigan, a second-round loser to eventual national champ 
Villanova in 1985.

<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- While Connecticut star Richard Hamilton was  
recovering from a broken foot last summer, he could have moped 
about his situation and missing a trip to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Hamilton used the down time to bond with his  
grandfather Edward, who had lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It taught me to not always take things for granted,'' Hamilton  
said Friday as the Huskies prepared to meet Gonzaga in the NCAA 
West Regional final on Saturday. ``If I had not been injured, I 
would not have had the time to be around the house and had the 
opportunity to spend a lot of time with my grandfather before he 
passed away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His grandfather didn't like to talk about the operations he  
underwent for cancer, but after Hamilton mentioned his own 
operation, it got Edward to open up about his. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very tough seeing him toward the end,'' Hamilton said.  
``But it was kind of good for me to be with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton said he dedicates games to his grandfather and often  
speaks about Edward Hamilton, who died in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad always tells me, `Pop is looking over you,''' said  
Hamilton, an All-America forward and two-time Big East player of 
the year. ``I play for him all the time. He is the inspiration of 
my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NEXT STOP JERRY SPRINGER?:* The jocular, almost jovial mood of  
the Gonzaga players would seem to make them ideal candidates for 
television talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	So the starters were asked if they were headed for the Jay Leno  
or David Letterman late night circuit? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'd be better on Jerry Springer than on late night  
talk shows,'' Matt Santangelo said, drawing laughter during a news 
conference. ``I think Springer would fit our personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, the Bulldogs are satisfied just getting on ESPN's  
highlights and being inundated with interview requests. Casey 
Calvary, who tipped in the winning basket against Florida on 
Thursday night, was awakened at 6:30 a.m. by a radio station and 
spent most of the morning answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being mad about being up at 6:30 in the morning, I  
thought about what an honor that we're here,'' he said. ``I talked 
with this Sports Babe this morning and it was kind of exciting. I 
watched that show when it was on ESPN2. It's something you can tell 
your friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two years from now, I'll be some bum on the corner in Spokane

	 *LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON:* Gonzaga coach Dan Monson has been  
around basketball forever. His dad, Don, coached at Idaho and 
Oregon, and discouraged his son from getting into what can be a 
ruthless profession. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Monson said his son was going to be a math teacher.  
</P>
<P>
	``He went to Oregon City, Ore., as a junior varsity coach, but  
he decided after teaching two classes of computer science and three 
of math each day he'd rather coach,'' Don Monson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan got his assistant coaching jobs at Alabama Birmingham, then  
at Gonzaga, without his father's help, his dad insists. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dan said it ultimately was his father's influence from early  
childhood that led him to the profession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still remember the rules in the gym,'' the son said. ``When  
practice was going on, and the whistle blew, you had to grab the 
ball, because it couldn't bounce when he was talking. I learned to 
add and subtract from the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a huge part of my life, and ultimately that's why I  
ended up in coaching, because I idolized my father and the kind of 
lifestyle he had.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEY, KHALID, WANT SOME PIZZA?:* Khalid El-Amin, Connecticut's  
flashy point guard, doesn't mind being teased about his chunky 
look. He's used to being offered advice and food, mostly food, by 
opposing fans before games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year at Virginia, we were warming up and on the layup  
line when a guy asked me if I was hungry,'' El-Amin said. ``He held 
up a Domino's pizza box. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I wasn't hungry, and he said he would hold it for me  
until halftime, that I should be hungry by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made me want to go out and have a better game.''  
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have a great game, but Connecticut did beat Virginia.

<HEADLINE> NJ Teen Pleas Guilty To Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A teen-ager pleaded guilty Friday to  
strangling an 11-year-old neighbor who came to his door selling 
gift wrap and candy for the PTA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Manzie, 17, appeared calm as he described in court how he  
choked Eddie Werner with a cord from an alarm clock for 40 minutes, 
stuffed his body into a suitcase and dragged it into the woods. He 
did not address prosecutors' allegations that he raped the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie, who was in sixth grade, was hoping to win a walkie-talkie  
set by selling the most items. His 1997 killing shocked the 
community and raised questions about the use of children for 
fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie faces 30 years to life in prison at sentencing April 14.  
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for his pleading guilty to murder, prosecutors  
dropped charges that he raped and robbed the boy. Manzie had been 
scheduled to stand trial as an adult next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, sitting in court and dredging up everything would  
be very difficult, hard for the kids, the family and his friends,'' 
said Eddie's mother, Valerie Werner. ``I'm just glad we won't have 
to go through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie's lawyers had planned to argue that Manzie, 15 at the  
time of the killing, had a mental defect that prevented him from 
forming the intent necessary to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie was killed three days after Manzie's parents sought  
unsuccessfully to have a judge commit the boy to an institution 
because of erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie also was involved with an alleged pedophile, Stephen P.  
Simmons, 45, whom he met in an online chat room, the defense said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Simmons carried on a sexual relationship with  
the teen that included hotel room trysts and photographs of sex 
acts. Simmons, of Holbrook, N.Y., is charged with sexual assault 
and other counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie allegedly killed Eddie when the boy rejected Manzie's  
sexual advances. Afterward, he took a photograph of the boy, who 
was half-naked and had a necktie and a cord around his neck, 
according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie then stuffed the 4-foot-11, 60-pound body into a suitcase  
and dragged it away. It was found two days later. Manzie was 
arrested within days.

<HEADLINE> Russian Leaders Seek IMF Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian officials tried today to persuade the  
International Monetary Fund to release new loans and warned that a 
refusal would be bad for the IMF as well as Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF mission has been in Moscow for more than a week to  
prepare a report on Russia's finances before Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov visits the United States next week for talks on resuming 
loans from the fund. The IMF group was expected to leave Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must head toward conclusion of the talks and find possible  
solutions to our problems,'' First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri 
Maslyukov said before meeting the IMF team. ``If talks fail to 
bring a success, we will both be hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov was also expected to meet with the IMF later today.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been trying to convince the fund that its finances  
are well enough in order to merit resumption of loans that were 
frozen after the government defaulted on some debts and devalued 
the ruble in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The country remains mired in economic recession and the  
government has said that it will not be able to pay about $17.5 
billion in foreign debts that fall due this year unless it gets new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But loan talks have been stalled for months because the IMF  
disapproves of the government's desire to cut some taxes, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov said Primakov would meet with President Clinton and  
Vice President Al Gore during his trip to the United States to 
lobby for IMF loans and discuss restructuring Russia's foreign 
debt, which totals $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``As is known, the U.S. administration has a large influence on  
international financial institutions,'' Maslyukov said in an 
interview with the business daily Kommersant, published today.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member May Have Gotten Jewelry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The former wife of embattled IOC  
member Phil Coles of Australia told the committee today that the 
couple received jewelry from a Greek businessman connected with 
Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The diamond-and-gold jewelry -- a necklace and cufflinks turned  
into earrings, all valued at $6,300 -- is at the heart of the latest 
allegations that Coles repeatedly violated rules limiting gifts 
from bid cities to $150. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said again today he wouldn't resign from the IOC. But a  
senior IOC official said the information probably would force the 
committee to reopen an ethics inquiry on Coles, who already has 
received a severe warning in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and 
been told that another offense could lead to his expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgina Coles sent a fax to IOC director general Francois  
Carrard and vice president Dick Pound, saying the jewelry was given 
to her and her then-husband during a visit to the Greek capital in 
1990 ``by a man associated with the Athens bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athens lost the '96 race to Atlanta in September 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	In the fax, received at IOC headquarters early today from  
Australia, Georgina Coles said she had the cufflinks turned into 
earrings. A photo in today's Sydney Morning Herald showed her 
wearing what the paper said were those earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the two IOC officials this would be her final comment  
on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The fax was taken to an IOC executive board meeting but there  
was no immediate decision on how to proceed, IOC spokesman Franklin 
Cerven-Schrieber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC has been interested in serious proof,'' he said. ``We  
still have to see whether all the material evidence is sufficient 
to see if the investigation should continue or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who is the head of the IOC's internal investigation that  
expelled six members in the Salt Lake case, said before the board 
meeting that he had not seen the fax and could not comment. He said 
Thursday that he would wait for Georgina Coles to provide 
information before deciding weather to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	But another board member on the inquiry commission, Belgium's  
Jacques Rogge, said the inquiry probably would reopen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine so,'' Rogge told Australian Associated Press when  
asked if the investigation would resume. 
</P>
<P>
	John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee,  
also said he expected the inquiry to resume. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to wait for the filing. That will determine if Phil  
is still and IOC member,'' Coates said. ``It's very sad for Phil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and repeated today that  
he would not resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, absolutely not,'' he said when asked if he planned to step  
down from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Sydney, Olympics boss Michael Knight called on Coles to  
``stop the pain'' by quitting the board of SOCOG, the organizing 
committee for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, the SOCOG president, said the IOC had to investigate the  
jewelry claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had stepped aside from the SOCOG board pending the IOC's  
inquiry into the Salt Lake City ethics report. Now he wants to come 
back, although Knight remains strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very surprised if he walked back into the next  
SOCOG board meeting,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing that Phil could do, in his best interest, to  
stop all this pain that he's getting publicly, is to stop bearing 
that pain and make a decision himself,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry about Phil's situation. I feel very sad for Phil  
Coles. You've only got to look at television of him out of Lausanne 
to see his health's not good, his demeanor's not good and he's 
obviously very shattered by the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``On a human level, you can't help but feel sorry for him.''  
</P>
<P>
	Knight said he and Coles had not talked because Coles is upset  
at Knight's recent comments. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway said the Sydney Games were  
bleeding because of the controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always taken the view that no aspect of these  
controversies has been helpful,'' Hollway told reporters in 
Lausanne. ``I've said it's been hurtful, there's been remorselessly 
bad publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now (the IOC) clearly have to have some investigation, some  
form of inquiry into the allegations about Athens and the 
jewelry,'' Knight said. ``You don't have to be a rocket- science 
student looking at this morning's newspapers to know that some of 
those stories and photos don't look terribly good for him whatever 
the final outcome.''

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Prison officials denied today news reports  
that they were considering transferring an American woman serving a 
life sentence for terrorism back to a frigid mountain prison. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-native Lori Berenson, 29, was transferred in October  
from Yanamayo prison, 12,700 feet above sea level in the Andes 
mountains, to the lower-lying and warmer Socabaya prison, 465 miles 
southeast of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents had complained their daughter's health was  
deteriorating in icy Yanamayo, where there was no heating or glass 
over the windows, allowing mountains winds to sweep through cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Major newspapers in Lima reported Friday that authorities in  
Socabaya had discovered that Berenson was planning to escape with 
the help of rebels outside the prison and had asked that she be 
transferred back to Yanamayo, which has greater security.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Wealthy landowners in a southern state

Brazilian media reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most landowners have armed themselves with guns and  
machine-guns and several are also using land mines to protect their 
property,'' the Jornal do Brasil news agency quoted Dioneia Froes 
Dresch, a landowner and attorney representing several ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dresch said the landowners were protecting their land from the  
Landless Rural Workers Movement, which has drawn national attention 
to land reform by organizing large-scale invasions of land it 
considers unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman at the Parana State Security Bureau said police were  
investigating ``to determine if the lawyer was telling the truth or 
if she was bluffing.''

	Vendors who usually stack wares on the sidewalks were instead  
swarming along Duarte Avenue Friday morning, where nervous shop 
owners periodically raised and lowered the steel shutters they use

Wednesday and Thursday over fears of vandalism.

<HEADLINE> Gore to Get Daschle's Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore will pick up the  
presidential endorsement of the Democrats' Senate leader, Tom 
Daschle, during a visit to South Dakota on Monday, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was endorsed by Rep. Dick Gephardt, the party's House  
leader, this week as the Democratic establishment began to close 
ranks. Some Democratic leaders are hoping to settle the nomination 
early, allowing the party to focus on the battle to retain the 
White House without a difficult primary campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is headed Monday to an innovative elementary  
school in Sioux Falls for an appearance with Daschle and South 
Dakota's other Democratic senator, Tim Johnson. Johnson said both 
he and Daschle would endorse Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore is a very solid, very thoughtful leader ... who  
understands the problems of rural America, but also understands the 
need to promote a high-tech future for our country as well,'' 
Johnson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, who had considered seeking the nomination himself,  
endorsed Gore this week during a campaign swing through New 
Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The only rival to formally enter the race for the Democratic  
presidential nomination is former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, who 
has run an active campaign in key early states such as Iowa and New 
Hampshire, though he's trailed in the early polling. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time candidate Jesse Jackson is also considering a bid.  
</P>
<P>
	While Gore is well positioned in the race for the Democratic  
nomination, polls have shown some weakness in matchups with 
prominent Republicans such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush and 
Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a large field of potential Republican candidates, and  
some Democrats believe Gore could benefit if he could take the high 
road while Republicans rip into each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Following his appearance in South Dakota, Gore will head for two  
campaign stops in central Iowa later Monday. Precinct caucuses in 
Iowa launch the presidential nominating season early next year, 
followed quickly by the nation's first primary in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential contenders should avoid attacking Bush  
and Mrs. Dole to give them ``a decent interval'' to lay out an 
agenda, commentator Pat Buchanan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make our differences known closer to the primaries,''  
Buchanan said in an interview. He said he had spoken with some of 
the other Republican candidates on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan himself is known as a firebrand on the campaign trail.  
Some Republicans blame his 1992 primary campaign against 
then-President Bush for setting the president up to lose the 
election to Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican strategists also argue that a strident assault on  
front-runner Bob Dole during the last primary season left him a 
wounded nominee incapable of seriously challenging Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan rejected suggestions that he was a strange candidate to  
be bearing a peace pipe. He noted that it was Steve Forbes who 
waged the assault on Dole in the last election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing Bush and Mrs. Dole with a big lead over their  
potential rivals, there have already been some rhetorical shots 
fired this year. Former Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has 
criticized Bush's use of the term ``compassionate conservative'' 
and publisher Forbes also has had critical remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said of his party's front-runners: ``I believe and I  
hope the Republican candidates will respond and give them some 
breathing room and a chance to lay out their agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Republicans are going to hold their fire as long  
as they can,'' he said. ``Republicans want to avoid a bloodbath 
because they can taste victory in 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been exploring a presidential candidacy for  
months, Rep. John Kasich snapped that he doesn't ``do politics'' 
when a television reporter asked him this week about his ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio Republican was making campaign-style appearances in New  
Hampshire when an interview with television station WNDS went awry. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporter Alicia Preston said Friday that Kasich had just  
finished touring a Merrimack investment company and she asked him 
when he would decide whether to run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea,'' he barked. ``That's a mechanical, political  
question and I don't do politics. You'll have to ask my press 
secretary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WNDS aired the exchange that night, describing Kasich as  
``agitated and abrupt.'' Later in the week, The Union Leader of 
Manchester wrote sarcastically about his comments in a political 
column. 
</P>
<P>
	A supporter said Kasich was not aware he was being filmed. He  
went on to answer other questions for the WNDS reporter, then 
hurried off to another appearance and an interview with another 
station.

<HEADLINE> Shares in Japan Telecom Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange halted trading of Japan  
Telecom Co. on Friday following a news report that AT&AMP;T Corp. and 
British Telecommunications may buy a large stake in the 
long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. and British companies are negotiating with Japan  
Telecom -- one of Japan's four largest long-distance companies -- to 
buy a joint stake of 30 percent, the Nihon Keizai business daily 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been decided at this time about the reported  
tie-up with foreign capital,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Before trading was suspended, Japan Telecom shares soared 16.4  
percent to 1.42 million yen ($12,034) per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said negotiations have entered ``the final stage.''  
If true, it would be the first investment by foreign phone 
companies in a major Japanese long-distance provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom has struggled with declining earnings since Japan  
started deregulating its long-distance market in recent years. Last 
year, it recorded a net profit of $131 million on $3.3 billion in 
sales.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Investigate Jewelry Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A day after a crisis meeting to  
clean up the Salt Lake bribery scandal, the IOC began investigating 
a prominent Australian member after his ex-wife said the couple 
received $6,300 in jewelry from a bid city. 
</P>
<P>
	The former wife of Phil Coles sent a fax to International  
Olympic Committee officials stating the couple received diamond 
cufflinks and a gold necklace during a trip to Athens in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the jewelry was presented to the couple by an  
unidentified man involved with Greece's failed bid for the 1996 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more than  
$150. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Coles said the cufflinks were turned into gold earrings,  
adding, ``This is my final statement on the matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A photo in Friday's Sydney Morning Herald showed Mrs. Coles  
wearing what the paper said were those earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations previously had been reported in the Australian  
media, but the IOC said it wouldn't investigate unless it received 
documented evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of the fact that a communication has been received  
from a third party, the executive board decided to investigate the 
matter further,'' the IOC said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil and Georgina Coles went through a bitter divorce in the  
early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles, 67, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and repeated  
Friday that he would not resign from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, absolutely not,'' he said when asked if he planned to step  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he would remain on leave from the board of the  
organizing committee for the 2000 Sydney Games ``until the matter 
is resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had previously resigned from his paid position as  
international relations director of the Australian Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Olympics boss Michael Knight called on Coles to quit  
the board of the Sydney Organizing Committee (SOCOG). 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be very surprised if he walked back into the next  
SOCOG board meeting,'' Knight said. ``The best thing that Phil 
could do, in his best interest, to stop all this pain that he's 
getting publicly, is to stop bearing that pain and make a decision 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Olympic Charter, IOC members from the host country  
must serve on the board of the organizing committee. As long as 
Coles remains on the IOC, he would keep his SOCOG position. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was one of more than 20 members implicated in the bribery  
scandal involving Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. In an unprecedented purge, six members were expelled 
Wednesday, while four others had previously resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	He was among 10 members who received warnings in the Salt Lake  
case from a special IOC inquiry commission. He received the most 
severe degree of censure for accepting excessive travel, gifts and 
hospitality from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry panel said Coles could face expulsion ``should  
similar facts ever occur again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, the IOC said the inquiry commission was  
being dissolved and its responsibilities were being taken over by 
the executive board, pending the formation of a new ethics 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The move takes the Coles case out of the control of Dick Pound,  
the IOC vice president who headed the inquiry panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound had been accused of showing favoritism toward Coles, a  
longtime friend. The two dined together last month after Coles 
testified before Pound's commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissolution of the inquiry panel could also affect the other  
investigation that remains open -- that of South Korean executive 
board member Kim Un-yong, the highest-ranking official implicated 
in the Salt Lake affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim had received the same severe warning as Coles. The inquiry  
panel said he would be expelled if new evidence proved Kim knew 
that the Salt Lake committee paid for his son's salary at a 
telecommunications company. Pound had said he believed such 
evidence existed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim and Pound are bitter rivals. They were involved in a heated  
confrontation at IOC headquarters earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' case came up during a meeting of the executive board with  
Sydney organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their business, not mine,'' SOCOG chief executive Sandy  
Hollway said. ``They showed us a copy of the letter and said they 
want to deliberate on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said SOCOG was still $135 million short of its sponsorship  
revenue target, with $53 million still to be identified. But he was 
confident much of the money will be raised. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted the scandals have made the revenue drive more  
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acknowledge the climate has not been ideal, but so far it  
has not hurt us on the sponsorship side,'' he said. ``All the 
sponsors want the scandal cleaned up and they have all stayed 
solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another matter, the executive board approved a change in the  
start time of the women's marathon, from 7:45 a.m. to 9 a.m., on 
the request of Japanese TV networks.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Taking a Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Louis Farrakhan's doctor scornfully denied today  
that the Nation of Islam leader is gravely ill but said he is 
suffering the side effects of cancer treatment, flu and fatigue and 
will take four months off to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should serve notice to all of the vultures who are  
hovering over what they expect to be a dead carcass that you can go 
home,'' Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad said at a news conference at 
Farrakhan's South Side restaurant, Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no death vigil. There is no death watch. The  
minister's life is not in imminent danger from any medical cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was not at the news conference. Nation of Islam  
officials said only that he is not in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent article in the Nation of Islam newspaper, The Final  
Call, said Farrakhan has been ``struggling to overcome the forces 
of death'' since he came down with a mysterious illness in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted the minister as saying in a Feb. 28 speech  
that he had lost 20 pounds in two weeks and had ``no appetite, 
night sweats ... the after-effects of radiation therapy and other 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was first treated for what the doctor called ``garden  
variety prostate cancer'' in 1991, with hormonal therapy. Three 
years later, doctors began planting radioactive seeds -- bits of 
metal designed to kill cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad said Farrakhan has taken the prostate specific antigen  
test commonly given to middle-aged and older men and has gotten 
readings that ranged from ominous to seemingly cancer-free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of you who have black hair now -- your hair will be silver  
before he leaves the scene,'' Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Farrakhan has suffered intestinal discomfort and  
anemia as side effects of the treatment, and has been weakened by 
two bouts of the flu last September and 40 years of leading the 
Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Farrakhan has decided to stay out of sight and rest  
before returning to go on a 35-city tour of the United States. 
``You all will have to wait four months before you see him and then 
you can judge for yourself,'' Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	The minister has been controversial because of his support of  
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and contemptuous remarks about Jews, 
Christians, white men and the U.S. government.

<HEADLINE> LVMH Offers To Buy All of Gucci </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy  
Louis Vuitton offered Friday to buy all of Gucci Group in a sudden 
change of course forced by a rival offer for the Italian fashion 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH's bid came after Gucci agreed earlier in the day to sell a  
40 percent stake to French retailer Pinault-Printemps-Redoute for 
$2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH said if Gucci scraps that deal, it will offer more than the  
$75 per share offered by Pinault-Printemps. But LVMH declined to 
reveal the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial analysts, howver, estimated the offer is about $80 a  
share, which would value Gucci at more than $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gucci spokeswoman, who declined to be named, called LVMH's  
takeover bid ``a victory for Gucci,'' as LVMH is offering the price 
that Gucci has been asking since LVMH began buying Gucci shares on 
the stock market earlier this year. She also declined to name the 
price LVMH has offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci said its board would review LVMH's bid at a meeting Sunday  
and decide whether to recommend it to shareholders over the offer 
from Pinault-Printemps, whose chairman is Francois Pinault, 
France's wealthiest financier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gucci is the world's prime luxury brand and LVMH is obviously  
willing to pay for it,'' said Jan Linderman, a director at the 
London consulting firm Interbrand, Newell and Sorrell. ``It is not 
a cheap buy, but I think they can pull it off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinault-Printemps' move for Gucci amounted to a slap in the face  
for LVMH's chairman Bernard Arnault, who has spent the past month 
wooing Gucci himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci had argued until now that LVMH was attempting a ``creeping  
takeover,'' and demanded that LVMH either make a full bid or 
provide legal guarantees limiting its influence. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH had sought control of Gucci, but said it wasn't interested  
in making a full takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH and Gucci have been locked in a fight for control for the  
past month, following LVMH's $1.4 billion purchase of a 34.4 
percent stake in the Italian company. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that Gucci, which has staged a spectacular  
turnaround over the past two years, has the potential for growth in 
leather goods, watches and fashion items that could give LVMH a 
needed boost. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH on Thursday posted a 29 percent drop in 1998 net profit,  
mainly because of weakness in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH isn't limiting its horizons to Gucci, however. The United  
States is an increasingly important market for the luxury goods 
giant, which wants to counterbalance the effects of Asia's 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the new direction, the French group on Thursday  
announced it has purchased a controlling stake in New York 
cosmetics and spa company Bliss World, which makes and markets 
skin-care and home-spa products under the Remede and Bliss brands, 
and also bought a 24 percent stake in U.S. sportswear brand Gant 
through its LV Capital investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
	LVMH owns a wide array of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton,  
Christian Dior, Givenchy and champagne maker Veuve Cliquot.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-American Memorial Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis joined Japanese-American  
World War II veterans and former internees to unveil the design for 
a new national monument that honors their sacrifices during the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1942 and 1946, nearly 120,000 Japanese-Americans on the  
West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii were deemed security threats by the 
U.S. government and forced from their homes into internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first heard about the idea of constructing this  
memorial, my first response was, 'It's about time,''' Davis said 
Friday at the Japanese American National Museum in the city's 
Little Tokyo area. ``When America makes a mistake, it should 
acknowledge the mistake, make amends for the mistake and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Washington-based National Japanese American  
Memorial Foundation said they have raised nearly $5.7 million for 
the project but need an additional $2.9 million by August to start 
construction in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in the audience was Herbert Kimoto, an engineer with  
the U.S. Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a mostly 
Japanese-American unit that fought German soldiers in Italy. He 
hopes the memorial will remind younger generations about the role 
Japanese-Americans played during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a lot of lives. This will prove our worth, that we did  
fight for our country,'' he said. ``We had to sacrifice a lot to 
get to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An artist's rendering of the design showed a high granite wall  
surrounded by gardens on a triangular piece of federal land near 
the Capitol. On the wall will be inscriptions and engraved pictures 
detailing the lives of Japanese-American veterans and internees. 
</P>
<P>
	A reflecting pool near the wall will contain six large rocks,  
representing the islands of Japan. In the center of the monument 
will stand a sculpture of two Japanese cranes entwined in barbed 
wire, symbolizing the loss of freedom suffered by internees, 
foundation officials said.

<P>
	Today is Saturday, March 20, the 79th day of 1999. There are 286  
days left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Highlight in History:  
</P>
<P>
	On March 20, 1899, Martha M. Place of Brooklyn, N.Y., became the  
first woman to be executed in the electric chair. She was put to 
death at Sing Sing for the murder of her stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	On this date:  
</P>
<P>
	In 1413, England's King Henry IV died.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1727, physicist, mathematician and astronomer Sir Isaac  
Newton died in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte entered Paris, beginning his  
``Hundred Days'' rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1816, the Supreme Court affirmed its right to review state  
court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1896, U.S. Marines landed in Nicaragua to protect U.S.  
citizens in the wake of a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, John Lennon married Yoko Ono in Gibraltar.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1976, kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst was  
convicted of armed robbery for her part in a San Francisco bank 
holdup. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of  
AZT, a drug shown to prolong the lives of some AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, in Tokyo, 12 people were killed, more than 5,500 others  
sickened, when packages containing the poisonous gas sarin leaked 
on five separate subway trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth confirmed  
that his office was investigating ``serious allegations'' involving 
Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose. Ueberroth's successor, A. 
Bartlett Giamatti, later banned Rose from baseball for betting on 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: El Salvador held its first presidential election  
following the country's 12-year-old civil war. Armando Calderon Sol 
of the ARENA party led the vote, but needed to win a run-off to 
achieve the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: President Clinton's lawyer, appearing before a  
federal court, declared that Paula Jones' evidence of sexual 
harassment was ``garbage'' unworthy of a trial. A tornado in rural 
northeast Georgia killed at least 13 people and injured 100. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Numbers Like Duke's Don't Lie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A team that has an advantage in  
almost every area doesn't need any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Duke has one.  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils have national bests of 93.6 points per game and  
a 26.3 average margin of victory, a 51.7 shooting percentage that 
ranks No. 2 in the country, a school-record 29-game winning streak 
and two NCAA tournament games they won by an average of 41 points. 
What other edge can they have as they head into tonight's East 
Regional semifinal against Southwest Missouri State? 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is 13-1 in Continental Airlines Arena, and four of those  
wins have sent the Blue Devils on to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	That means 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State has to play Duke  
in a building where the Blue Devils have a better winning 
percentage than they do at Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about not being in awe,'' Bears coach Steve Alford said.  
``What we've tried to do over the last four days is diminish the 
awe a little bit as each day passes. Because if we're in awe at 
7:35, by 7:45, like a lot of other teams this year, it's going to 
be over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (34-1) has won its last 11 games by an average of 31  
points, and since Feb. 11, only one team has been within 20 points 
at game's end. That was North Carolina State, which lost by 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of 35 games, there have been probably 30 games where a  
team has, I don't want to say quit, but you know it's over,'' Duke 
forward Chris Carrawell said. ``A couple of teams we played, they'd 
just start talking to us: `You guys are really good.' It's a 
conversation now. We're buddies because the game is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri State (22-10), which has won its NCAA  
tournament games by a combined 41 points, has to make sure it 
doesn't get started in this reverse trash-talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're a great team, they've been a great team all  
year, the No. 1 team in the polls,'' Bears junior guard Kevin Ault 
said. ``We just have to put all that behind us. There are 16 teams 
left in the country and we're one of them, and we have to play that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke center Elton Brand, the only unanimous AP All-American,  
isn't concerned he and his teammates could get caught up hearing 
about how great they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach has instilled the will to win in us, to play our hardest  
every time out,'' Brand said of Mike Krzyzewski. ``We don't look at 
the name of the team we're playing. As long as Duke's playing, 
we're out there to play our best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski needs two wins to tie John Wooden for second place on  
the career NCAA tournament victory list at 47, 18 behind Dean 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford has two wins in the NCAA tournament -- the ones over  
fifth-seeded Wisconsin and fourth-seeded Tennessee last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team doesn't have the fortune of being led by a coach  
who's been there and done that,'' Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski was asked which is tougher: bringing in a heavy  
favorite or leading the underdog with nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the coach in each particular situation will tell you  
that situation is the hardest,'' he said. ``I'd rather be in the 
situation I'm in. I have a really good basketball team. I respect 
the team we're playing. I'd rather get my team ready to play 
Southwest Missouri State than switch roles with Steve Alford. I 
don't know which is harder, but I'll take the one I'm in.''

	Dow Tops 10,000  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average hovered over  
the 10,000 mark today, trying to cling to early gains fed by 
yesterday's market rally. Just before noon EST, the Dow was up 7.49 
at 10,005.11. The Dow teased investors yesterday, climbing above 
10,000 six separate times, only to fall just 2.68 points short at 
the close. The Dow has more than quadrupled since 1990. NYSE 
decliners led advancers 1,489-1,257. The Nasdaq was down 8.64 to 
2,454.32.

	Mandela: Libya To Hand Over Suspects  
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- South African President Nelson Mandela says  
Libya will turn over two suspects in the deadly bombing of a Pan Am 
jet over Scotland some time in the next three weeks. The men have 
long been wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of the London 
to New York flight, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, 
killing all 270 people aboard. America and Britain have agreed to a 
plan to put the suspects on trial in the Netherlands, using 
Scottish judges.

	Kosovo Peace Talks Adjourned  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade is being evacuated and  
international monitors are leaving Kosovo after peace talks broke 
down today, raising the prospect of NATO airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces also appear to be preparing for all-out 
war in the province. Ethnic Albanians have signed a peace deal that 
would end the violence in Kosovo, but Serbs have refused to agree 
because of a key element that calls for NATO troops to be stationed 
in Yugoslavia.

	Confusion Over Train Witness Story  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- There are conflicting reports about  
what an eyewitness claims to have seen before the deadly derailment 
of an Amtrak train. Authorities say language problems with the 
Spanish-speaking man are leading to conflicting statements about 
whether the gates were up or down at a crossing when a truck the 
train struck started across. The witness is a motorist who says he 
was driving directly behind the truck that was hit by the train. 
Eleven people aboard the train were killed.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- At least 56 people were killed today when a  
powerful bomb exploded in a crowded food market in southern Russia. 
More than 100 others were injured in the blast, police said. 
Authorities said it was difficult to determine how many people were 
killed because many bodies had been torn to bits by the blast. The 
bomb exploded near a row of stalls selling potatoes and many of the 
dead and injured appeared to be pensioners and poor workers, 
witnesses said. Police had no immediate details on what happened or 
who may have been responsible for the bombing.

	Teen To Plead Guilty in Killing  
</P>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A teen-ager accused of killing an  
11-year-old neighbor who was selling items door to door for a 
school fund-raiser has agreed to plead guilty, authorities said. 
Sam Manzie, 17, was scheduled to enter his plea this afternoon. He 
was charged with murder, robbery and aggravated sexual assault. 
Eddie Werner, 11, was robbed, raped and murdered on Sept. 27, 1997, 
as he was out selling gift wrap and other holiday items for the 
PTA. Manzie allegedly killed him after luring him into his home.

	Man Jailed for Eating Tortoise

	HONG KONG (AP) -- A Chinese illegal immigrant was given a year in  
jail for breaking into a Hong Kong home and eating an expensive pet 
tortoise. The judge spared Chau Chao-ping a longer sentence because 
Chau pleaded guilty and spared two other turtles. No one connected 
Chau with the death of the $130 tortoise until he was caught two 
weeks later sneaking back into Hong Kong -- clinging to the bottom 
of a container truck -- and his fingerprints matched those from the 
crime scene.

	Lakers Anticipate Rodman's Return  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers expect Dennis Rodman  
to return to the team shortly, but with Rodman, there's no way to 
tell when ``shortly'' actually is. The rebounding champion left the 
team last week because of ``personal issues.'' He has missed three 
games, two of which the Lakers lost. Coach Kurt Rambis says Rodman 
is being fined for every day he stays away.

<HEADLINE> DNC Chairman Decries GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democrats' incoming party chairman,  
promising today to be a scorched-earth GOP critic, called 
Republicans ``the cranks of American politics'' and their 
presidential hopefuls for 2000 a ``motley crew -- a disaster in the 
making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The current crop of Republican presidential candidates is a  
Democratic consultant's dream,'' Joe Andrew said in a speech to the 
Democratic National Committee, which is set to name him national 
chairman on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican spokesman Mike Collins replied that Democrats, with  
Vice President Al Gore as their 2000 favorite, are in no position 
to criticize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats are becoming aware with Al Gore's gaffe-a-day  
campaign that the chips in his head are having their Y2K crisis 
nine months early,'' he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton tapped Andrew to replace Steve Grossman, a  
longtime activist from Massachusetts who resigned after the mostly 
successfully midterm election last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend's Democratic meeting also will provide the latest  
stage for Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in their 
contest for the party's presidential nomination. Bradley, busy 
campaigning in Iowa, sent his wife to court activists. Gore will 
address the group Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming majority of DNC members back Gore, but an  
anxious minority say they may side with Bradley. Some say they fear 
that Clinton scandals will rub off on the vice president; others 
are fretting about polls showing Gore trailing Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the current GOP favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to open this up so people can see who Bradley is,''  
said Virgie Rollins, a DNC member from Detroit who is not committed 
to either candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton hosted a reception Friday evening for the party leaders  
on the South Lawn of the White House and exhorted them to recruit 
strong candidates for the 2000 elections and involve people from 
all walks of life to get involved in the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democratic Party is determined to go into the 21st century  
taking everybody along,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew, 39, the former Indiana state party chairman who  
introduced the use of computer technology in his state's 
grass-roots organizing, promised an information-age approach to his 
work in Washington. He wants to create a National Voter File to 
help state parties ``slice and dice information'' so they can 
customize their messages to voting blocs. 
</P>
<P>
	And he will invest $1 million to upgrade software of state  
parties, linking them by computer to the DNC. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew also promised to re-establish a training center for  
Democratic operatives, recruit 1 million volunteers by 2000, create 
a Democratic Mayors Campaign Committee, build a new Washington 
headquarters for the DNC and open a ``campaign store'' on the 
Internet -- one-stop shopping for a candidate who needs anything 
from telephones to car rentals. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks Friday were laced with attacks on Republicans, and  
the boyish-looking Andrew said after his address that he didn't 
mind being called the party's attack dog. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans have become the cranks of American politics,''  
he said, contending that GOP stands for ``Grumpy Old Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the midst of undeniably good times, they still see an enemy  
under every bed, a crack in every sidewalk, a cloud behind every 
silver lining,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew saved a one-liner for nearly every GOP presidential  
hopeful, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--Texas Governor Bush, son of former President Bush: ``Voters  
know astonishingly little about him other than the monogram on his 
shirtsleeve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Vice President Dan Quayle: ``Quayle's a punchline, not a  
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Businessman Steve Forbes: He has ``the bank account of Bill  
Gates and the personality of MS-DOS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole. The GOP  
field is so weak ``no wonder lots of Republicans want to call in 
the Red Cross. Too bad for Liddy Dole that the first women elected 
president is going to be a pro-choice Democrat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Andrew and General Chairman Roy Romer conducted a  
news conference with their new co-chairmen, including Detroit Mayor 
Dennis Archer and Rep. Loretta Sanchez. Bush was a frequent target 
all day. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Democratic Chairman Molly Beth Malcolm, contending that  
her governor won't take a stand on national issues, said his 
nickname should be ``Beat-around-the Bush.''

<HEADLINE> Law Firms To Probe Minn. Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Minneapolis law firm and another with close  
ties to the NCAA will investigate reports of academic fraud 
involving Minnesota basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Glazier, a partner with suburban Kansas City, Mo., firm  
will lead the investigation. Donald Lewis of a Minneapolis-based 
firm will serve as co-counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof also said Friday he had  
instructed the investigation team to work closely with the NCAA 
enforcement staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``An investigation conducted by outside experts with  
considerable experience in NCAA matters will allow us to establish 
the facts in a thorough, impartial and prompt way,'' Yudof said. 
The inquiry is expected to take six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Four players were ruled ineligible for Minnesota's first-round  
NCAA game last week against Gonzaga after Jan Gangelhoff, a former 
office manager in the academic counseling office, said she did 
course work for at least 20 players over six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the initial fact-finding is completed by the outside  
firms, the Board of Regents and I will be in a position to identify 
the actions necessary to respond,'' Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glazier's firm is less than a mile from the headquarters of the  
NCAA's Overland Park office.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Moves to Sunday Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Never on Sunday for Oscar, the film industry  
said for 46 years. Too risky to air the Academy Awards on the 
weekend, when people should be buying movie tickets instead of 
enjoying a free TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chance to shore up TV ratings -- and a growing  
appreciation of the Academy Awards as an unparalleled promotional 
tool for Hollywood -- finally caused a reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
	When host Whoopi Goldberg steps on stage at 8:30 p.m. EST  
Sunday, ABC and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences 
hope that the weekend broadcast will be the start of a new 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great move,'' said Gil Cates, who is producing his  
ninth Oscar ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday is a festive day, a day of relaxation. It's a non-work  
day, and I think that comports well with what Oscar should be,'' he 
said. ``The whole phenomenon of folks rushing home from work to 
watch the show is going to be avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Oscar ratings rise and fall, the ceremony is  
television's second most-watched event after the Super Bowl. 
Commercial rates reportedly have reached $1 million for a 30-second 
spot, up from around $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the show is lacking a hit centerpiece like last year's  
``Titanic.'' Some of the nominees are in films largely unseen by 
moviegoers, such as best actor contenders Nick Nolte in 
``Affliction'' or Edward Norton in ``American History X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a blockbuster date, Oscar can be relatively unpopular.  
The 1997 ceremony, at which the highbrow film ``The English 
Patient'' dominated, had the second-worst ratings on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one is expecting the ceremony to match the 1998  
numbers, the best in 15 years, ABC is counting on the move from the 
show's longtime Monday berth and a half-hour earlier starting time 
to avoid a big deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday has the highest 'HUT' level of the week, more  
'households using television' than any other night,'' noted Michael 
Davies, ABC executive vice president in charge of specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier start ensures the ceremony will end at a reasonable  
hour, a ratings plus. Viewership tends to plummet when the Oscars 
stretch into the midnight hour on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The star quotient, of course, remains unchanged. Harrison Ford,  
Jack Nicholson, Denzel Washington, Kim Basinger, John Travolta, 
Annette Bening, Andy Garcia and Helen Hunt are among the 
presenters. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers are Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Whitney Houston,  
Mariah Carey, Randy Newman, Peter Gabriel, Allison Moorer and 
Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar winner Geena Davis (``The Accidental Tourist,'' 1988) will  
be host of an academy first: an exclusive pre-ceremony show 
beginning at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to attempt to give the audience a backstage pass  
and look at everything that goes into making the Oscar ceremony,'' 
said Davis. That includes clips of events leading up to the 
ceremony, such as the nominees' luncheon, and, of course, the 
fashion parade of arriving stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she immediately said yes to the job. ``I've always  
been a fan not only of the Oscars but of the excitement, and 
arrivals have always been a big part,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony itself will celebrate the waning century, Cates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inasmuch as film is a child of the 20th century and made its  
impact in the century, we're going to reflect on that,'' he said, 
including a look at what film's role might be in the next 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One era will loom especially large because of an honorary award  
being given to director Elia Kazan, whose critically acclaimed 
films include ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Gentleman's Agreement.'' 
Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are presenting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Kazan drew fire by giving the names of colleagues  
to the House Un-American Activities Committee investigating 
communist infiltration in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the passage of time, the award has divided the industry.  
``Age and ability in the arts or anything else, in my opinion, does 
not excuse a crime,'' said actor Rod Steiger, star of ``On the 
Waterfront.'' Actor Karl Malden was the member of the Academy's 
board who proposed the lifetime achievement award for Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd, citing  
the controversy, wrote in the trade paper's March 10 issue: ``I'm 
just one who will still remain seated during that honorary Oscar 
presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Cates: ``I think Army Archerd is dead wrong in his attitude  
toward Kazan. I think the academy is absolutely correct in honoring 
Kazan. He's a great director. ... I think the majority of the 
audience is delighted with that honorary Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging there are those who will refuse to applaud Kazan,  
Cates said: ``We'll show all.'' There will be no ``sweetening'' if 
the applause is scant or attempt to mask any boos, he said.

<HEADLINE> Retarded Kid's Parents File Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For a decade, Christina Anderson has tried to get  
her 41-year-old disabled daughter into a residential treatment 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie is mentally retarded, deaf and legally blind. Still,  
Christina Anderson said she has been told repeatedly that her 
daughter is ineligible because she is not considered a ``crisis'' 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against a stone wall,'' the retired 61-year-old  
factory worker from New Bedford said. ``I don't know what my own 
health needs will be, and I'd like to know she will be taken care 
of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christina Anderson is one of many plaintiffs in a class-action  
suit filed Friday in federal court to end long waiting lists for 
Medicaid-funded programs and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are demanding Massachusetts help 3,000 disabled  
adults, many of whom have waited more than 10 years for a place in 
a program that will take care of them. The plaintiffs are asking 
for an injunction forcing the state to act within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was inspired by a recent federal case in Florida,  
where the state was ordered to help thousands of retarded residents 
immediately or risk losing Medicaid funds, said Boston lawyer Neil 
McKittrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are legally entitled to these services and they  
shouldn't have to wait any longer,'' McKittrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Tummino, assistant commissioner for the state  
Department of Mental Retardation, said Massachusetts has earmarked 
$15 million a year over the next three years to bring the waiting 
list down from 3,400 in 1997 to 2,700 by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he said, the state will spend more than $50 million  
over six years to eliminate the waiting list for residential and 
day programs for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've done quite well, but I know we have more to  
do,'' Tummino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate action demanded by the federal lawsuit would be  
disruptive and unwieldy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But immediate action is what's needed for the estimated 52,000  
retarded adults who need housing support and 65,000 who need 
daytime or work support programs nationwide, the National 
Association for Retarded Citizens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're talking about the year 2007,'' said Leo Sarkissian,  
executive director of the Association of Retarded Citizens of 
Massachusetts, who estimated $100 million would be needed to solve 
the state's problem within the next four years. ``What does that 
mean for a caretaker in their 70s?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said increased lobbying across the country is having some  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to several lawsuits, the Florida Legislature is  
evaluating a $200 million budget proposal to establish more housing 
and programs for the retarded. New York is hammering out a 
five-year, $129 million plan to help 4,900 retarded adults on 
waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in New Jersey and Maryland are also taking closer  
looks at their waiting list problems, McKittrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Ann Boulet, 68, of Sharon said she hopes the Massachusetts  
lawsuit will cut through 15 years of red tape in getting her 
40-year-old son -- who is retarded and needs constant supervision 
for seizures -- into a group home. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, 6-foot-3 and more than 200 pounds, needs help  
showering, shaving, dressing and communicating with others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're frustrated,'' she said. ``We haven't been able to think  
about our own future at all. People don't really know what it's 
like.''

<HEADLINE> Van in Parade Deaths Had Defect </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A police van that plowed into a crowd at a  
parade Dec. 4, killing a baby and his aunt, had a mechanical 
defect, and no felony charges will be filed against the driver, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	State troopers determined that a mechanism to prevent the van  
from suddenly accelerating was disabled at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Tom Sawina was picking up intoxicated people along the  
route of the Holidazzle Parade, a downtown display of holiday 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the crash, the van revved loudly, and its wheels  
screeched and burned so much rubber that a thick cloud of black 
smoke floated up. The van smashed into an empty police cruiser, 
then plowed into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were 5-month-old Blake McCarty and Denise Keenan, 35.  
Eleven other spectators were injured. 
</P>

Sawina.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Leads NCAA Swimming Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Misty Hyman swam to victory in the 100-yard  
butterfly and was on two winning relay teams for Stanford, but host 
Georgia held onto its lead in the NCAA women's swimming and diving 
championships Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford is seeking its sixth national title in seven years,  
while Georgia has never finished higher than third in the national 
championships. But the top-seeded Lady Bulldogs grabbed a lead on 
the first day of the meet without winning an event, then made it 
stand on Day 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Hyman, Stanford set an American record in the 200 medley  
relay and dominated the 800 freestyle relay, the final event of the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped Stanford close the gap on Georgia, which leads with  
323.5 points. Georgia finally captured its first victory when world 
champion Kristy Kowal defended her title in the 100 breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford was second with 312 points and swapped places with  
Southern Methodist, which dropped to third with 273.5 points. No 
other school was even close to the leaders heading into Saturday's 
final night of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	SMU's Martina Moravcova won the ninth individual title of her  
career in the 200 freestyle. If the Slovakian swimmer defends her 
title in the 100 freestyle Saturday, she will finish second in 
career wins to Tracy Caulkins of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Caulkins won 12 individual titles before swimmers were limited  
to three individual events per championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Kowal failed to break her American record of 59.05 seconds in  
the 100 breaststroke, still winning with a time of 59.25. But she 
said winning the national title comes above individual 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can I be disappointed with my second-best time ever?'' she  
asked. ``We're not worried about personal bests at all. We're 
worried about the team now. The higher we place, the more points it 
means for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyman, the 1998 NCAA swimmer of the year, was the star of the  
night for Stanford. She helped the Cardinal defend its title in the 
200 medley relay, breaking their year-old NCAA record by 
three-hundredths of the second with a time of 1:37.77 
</P>
<P>
	Two events later, Hyman swam to victory on her own with a  
clocking of 51.77 in the 100 butterfly, even though a rule change 
prevented her trademark long underwater swims. Now, competitors 
must surface within 15 meters or face disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a great race, especially since the change in  
the rules affected my technique,'' she said. ``To come back and be 
as successful as I was makes me happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Hyman swam the fastest leg of the 800 freestyle relay  
as Stanford ran away from the field in 7:06.22 -- beating Arizona by 
nearly three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia had second-place finishes in both the 200 medley relay  
and 400 individual medley, Keegan Walkley giving the Lady Bulldogs 
valuable points in the latter race while freshman Maddy Crippen 
swam to Villanova's first national title ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (Saturday) morning is crucial,'' Georgia coach Jack  
Bauerle said, referring to the preliminary heats. ``I mean, that's 
the meet. We have to do well early to win the meet.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> America West, Union Keep Talking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The union for flight attendants at America West  
Airlines said Friday it was encouraged that talks continued even 
hours before a strike was to begin at the nation's ninth-largest 
air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the airline's 2,300 attendants were preparing for random  
walkouts in a campaign they call ``CHAOS'' that could leave up to 
100,000 passengers stranded this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	America West serves 53 domestic destinations overall and eight  
cities in Mexico and Canada. It has hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday morning, the airline and the union met for the third  
day in Washington, D.C., with federal mediators. But if they failed 
to reach an agreement by 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday, the flight 
attendants were free to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline brought in extra ticketing agents and airport staff  
Friday at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and McCarran 
International Airport in Las Vegas, said Stephen Johnson, America 
West vice president of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the company had contingency plans to ``respond to  
every eventuality,'' but said details of those plans were being 
kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping and praying for an agreement,'' said Deanna  
Clarkson, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union threatened a series of random, announced worked  
stoppages, dubbed CHAOS, for ``Creating Havoc Around Our System.'' 
On Thursday, it conducted a dry run to see how long it would take 
to get word to flight attendants that a flight was being struck and 
then to inform passengers. Clarkson said the flight attendants 
believe they can shut down the airline in 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	America West has threatened to fire flight attendants involved  
in such a strike and has warned that it may shut down the entire 
airline if CHAOS strikes begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants have been locked in a feud with the  
airline for four years since they unionized in 1994 -- three years 
after America West filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	During the bankruptcy reorganization, flight attendants took a  
10 percent pay cut, which has not been restored. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, buoyed by low fuel costs and good economic times,  
posted record profits in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants have been demanding that their pay be on  
par with the average of the top-10 carriers. Currently, about 
two-thirds of America West's flight attendants earn the top-scale 
salary of $23,800. Top-scale flight attendants at rival Southwest 
Airlines earn $41,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants also want the same daily expenses that  
pilots receive, $1.80 an hour away from their base city. Currently, 
flight attendants get no per diem allowance. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New  
York, said that like the 10-day sickout by pilots that disrupted 
American Airlines operations last month, the fight seems to be 
about more than the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a bitterness against the company,'' he said. ``There  
is a sense here that they want to show management that they matter 
or that they are important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engel said he didn't expect any strike to be long.  
</P>
<P>
	``They will have made their point. They will have vented,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Down; Crude Oil Up a Bit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean futures rocketed higher and were followed by corn and  
wheat in trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar was lower and crude oil posted modest  
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures were boosted by a preliminary estimate that  
showed reduced crop outputs in South America and feelings the 
United States government may take some action to assist soybean 
farmers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	While rumored government acreage set-asides that boosted prices  
earlier in the week apparently will not come to fruition this year, 
there is talk officials are mulling other options. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are indications the administration understands the  
plight of the American farmer, particularly the soybean farmer,'' 
said Don Roose of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited, however, by uncertainty over the South  
American figures and the fact that this is expected to be a harvest 
weekend in Brazil, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures followed soybeans higher, but received pressure  
from news of rainfall in parts of the central United States, where 
the hard red winter wheat crop is considered to be in good 
condition already. Wheat futures had fallen sharply Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also news that the Chinese wheat belt has received  
beneficial rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures hit an 8-month high amid speculation that a credit  
line allowing South Korea to purchase more corn could be approved 
next week. Also supportive were rumors that U.S. acres will be 
lower than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were kept in check by news that China is getting more  
aggressive in offering corn for export. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 2 cents to $2.75 3/4 a bushel; May corn  
rose 4 3/4 cents to $2.29 a bushel; May oats rose 2 cents to $1.13 a 
bushel; May soybeans rose 7 1/4 cents to $4.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies both posted 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures fell 0.50 cent to 66.65 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle fell 0.18 cent to 71.82 cents per pound; April 
lean hogs rose 0.53 cent to 42.80 cents a pound; and May pork 
bellies rose 0.55 cent to 51.45 cents per pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar fell on word that Brazil, the world's largest grower, is  
boosting exports despite weak world demand, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian cane crop could exceed last year's record output  
when it is harvested starting next month. Larger-than-expected 
harvests in Thailand and China are contributing to the ample 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for May delivery fell 0.18 cent to 5.54 cents a pound  
on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil posted slight gains on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange Friday as market participants awaited ratification of 
output cuts pledged by some of the world's largest producers. The 
agreement is expected to be approved at a meeting of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for April delivery rose 24 cents to $15.24 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends Gore about Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton defended Vice President Al  
Gore's claims that he helped create the Internet -- but didn't get 
it quite right himself today as he described the explosive growth 
of the worldwide computer network since his election. 
</P>
<P>
	The president defended Gore as ``one of the major architects of  
America's progress in technology'' and said he ``deserves a lot of 
appreciation for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton also appeared to undercount by almost 5,000 times  
the size of the Internet when he was first elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep in mind, I think when I became president in 1993 there  
were still only 50 or 60 sites on the Internet, and now there are 
millions and millions,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, by July of 1993 the computer network actually had  
26,000 total sites, called ``domains'' -- each with a unique 
Internet address, according to figures from the Commerce 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sites, however, weren't like the World Wide Web sites that  
most computer-users now browse with just a simple point and click. 
Instead, those earlier sites required arcane keyboard commands to 
navigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web was in its earliest stages in 1993. But  
Clinton failed to distinguish in his comments that he was referring 
only to the Web portion of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar Web sites didn't come into widespread use until 1994,  
although most experts estimate there were roughly 130 such Web 
sites by mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest browser to be widely used by consumers, Netscape's  
Mosaic software, emerged in late 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The company responsible for Internet addresses ending in  
``com,'' ``net'' and ``org'' recently announced it had registered 4 
million such sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore drew criticism from Republicans when he said last week that  
during his time in Congress he ``took the initiative in creating 
the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas called it an  
``outrageous claim,'' noting that the Internet developed from a 
research network originally constructed in 1969 -- long before Gore 
was elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stood by his running mate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, you know, he came a lot closer to inventing the Internet  
than I did,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Check for Overlooked Deductions / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If you refinanced a home mortgage last year, you  
may be eligible for a nice little tax deduction this year, along 
with any savings on interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax breaks also may be awaiting those struggling with college  
costs, job hunters, corporate climbers, even families who routinely 
chauffeur around the local soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government makes a wide array of tax deductions  
available each year, but some get overlooked simply because 
taxpayers don't know they exist or fully understand how they might 
apply to them. Although the IRS doesn't keep track of these sins of 
omission, tax preparers maintain they can add up to a lot of lost 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can happen whether people prepare their own taxes or have  
someone else do it for them,'' said Edward A. Slott, an accountant 
from Rockville Centre, N.Y., who publishes a weekly newsletter on 
tax and estate planning. ``People forget things ... and they forget 
to tell their preparer things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And speaking of preparers, the most easily overlooked tax  
deduction, according to the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young: fees for 
tax preparation services and IRS audits. 
</P>
<P>
	To get a better handle on potential tax savings, Slott and other  
tax experts suggest pulling out last year's return and using it as 
a road map for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see carryover. If, for example, you owed state taxes  
last year, that's an itemized deduction this year,'' Slott said. 
``There's a lot of tax information in last year's return that can 
help you this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While you're at it, pull out last year's calendar to help jog  
your memory about changing life situations for which you may be 
entitled to tax breaks, experts say. Did your household change 
during the year? Was there a change in residence or job? 
</P>
<P>
	If you're widowed and divorced and your son or daughter moved  
back home last year, for example, you may be in line for the breaks 
that come with filing as a head of household, rather than as a 
single individual. Also, if you helped an aging parent's medical 
expenses, you may be entitled to a deduction if you provide more 
than half of his or her support, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Job hunters can deduct the cost of a resume, postage and travel  
expenses, while those trying to improve their job skills and move 
up the corporate ladder can deduct nonreimbursed education expenses 
or items like dues to professional organizations, subscriptions to 
professional or trade journals, magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Your checking account statement also may be helpful in  
uncovering overlooked deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look where you spent your money. Did you have a lot of medical  
expenses? Did you write checks to charity? Some of these can be 
deducted,'' noted John Gardner, senior manager of the accounting 
firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most overlooked deductions may involve your home  
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	If you refinanced your mortgage more than once to take advantage  
of the ongoing decline in interest rates, you may be entitled to a 
deduction when you prepare your tax return this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's why: In refinancing the first time, you may have paid  
``points'' in exchange for a lower rate. One point equals 1 percent 
of the loan value. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service requires you to deduct the points  
you paid over the life of the refinanced loan rather than all at 
once. If you refinanced, say, two years ago and paid $3,000 in 
points on a 30-year loan, you probably have been deducting $100 a 
year for tax purposes. But when you refinance again, the life of 
the first refinanced loan ends, which means you can deduct the 
remaining points in a single year. In this case, the remaining 
$2,800. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something a lot of people miss,'' said Slott, adding  
that some individuals still might be able to take advantage of 
missed opportunities by amending previous years' returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Other missed opportunities may involve charitable work.  
</P>
<P>
	Garner urges individuals to not only keep track of big  
charitable gifts, but also pocket expenses paid while doing good 
work for nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly time is not deductible, but mileage is,'' he said.  
``If you're a soccer coach and you're running the kids around town 
(with your own car), that is something that is deductible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parking fees, tools, stamps and long-distance phone calls count  
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax preparers also urge individuals to keep track of changes in  
the tax law that can bring about savings, like the three new tax 
credits for 1998. This year, some taxpayers can get a $400 credit 
for children under age 17 and two education credits -- the Hope and 
Lifetime Learning credits -- that provide up to $1,500 and $1,000 
respectively for certain education expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Student loan interest also can be deducted. It begins at $1,000  
for tax year 1998 and reaches $2,500 by 2001.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Killed in Russian Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A powerful bomb shattered an outdoor food market  
packed with families doing their weekend shopping in southern 
Russia on Friday, killing at least 42 people and wounding scores of 
others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb exploded in downtown Vladikavkaz, the regional capital  
of North Ossetia, which borders the breakaway region of Chechnya. 
The blast raked the busy market, shattering stalls and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place looks like a meat grinder,'' said local journalist  
Olga Vyslova, reached by phone from Moscow, adding that the blast 
scene was littered with severed heads and limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Moscow,  
Viktor Beltsov, said 42 people had been killed and at least 70 
injured in the blast. But police officers in Vladikavkaz put the 
death toll at 50 with more than 100 injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Local people, many of them crying and shaking with grief,  
searched through the debris for survivors or helped ferry the 
injured to the hospital in ambulances and cars. Dozens of police 
officers and soldiers joined in the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said it was difficult to determine how many people were  
killed because many bodies had been torn to bits by the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many killed and injured. The situation is very  
confused,'' a police officer reached by phone said before hanging 
up abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulance workers and police used trolleys, normally used to  
shift boxes of vegetables, to remove bodies. Many of the victims 
were cut in half by the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb exploded near a row of stalls selling potatoes and many  
of the dead and injured appeared to be pensioners and poor workers, 
witnesses said. Blood covered surrounding walls. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical and emergency rescue teams from around the region were  
sent to the city to assist overwhelmed local hospitals cope with 
the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had no immediate details on what happened or who may have  
been responsible for the bombing. Local officers estimated the bomb 
had a blast equivalent to eight pounds of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin told Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin,  
head of the country's law enforcement services, to fly to 
Vladikavkaz to personally head the investigation in to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The region has been hit by a wave of violence and lawlessness in  
recent years because of political and ethnic unrest and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The region is close to Chechnya, which claimed independence from  
Russia after a 1994-96 war. Many parts of Chechnya are controlled 
by armed bands and the region is awash with crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	A EURO 2000 soccer match is scheduled to be held in Vladikavkaz  
next week between Russia and the tiny country of Andorra. The 
Andorra soccer federation earlier this month expressed concern 
about their team's safety in Vladikavkaz because of its proximity 
to Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, the Russian interior minister, had said Wednesday  
that the Andorra concerns were unjustified. He told reporters that 
he ``guarantees absolute security for the match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they doubted the bombing had any connection to the  
soccer match, but all possibilities were being investigated.

<HEADLINE> Realistic Fund Approach Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before you venture into any kind of mutual fund  
investment, it's a very good idea to check your expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	If you don't have a realistic picture of the potential rewards  
or risks involved in the style of investing your fund follows, your 
chances are seriously diminished of picking one that suits your 
needs and temperament. 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to gauge a fund's future prospects, one of the first  
things everybody looks at is how it performed in the past. But that 
alone can't give you a solid sense of how a fund might fare in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming into 1999, for example, many stock funds had racked up  
double-digit gains for four consecutive years. According to the 
research firm Lipper Inc., stock funds in the aggregate boast an 
average annual gain of better than 15 percent over the last decade, 
with nary a down year since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	You can certainly hope payoffs like this continue in the future.  
But it's not prudent to count on that kind of outcome, projecting 
that yesterday's trend will still be in force tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	``Be realistic,'' says Theresa Hamacher, chief investment  
officer at the Boston fund firm of Pioneer Investment Management 
Inc. ``Since 1983, U.S. stocks, represented by the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500, have averaged about 18 percent a year. That's well 
above the historical average. Returns are more likely to be smaller 
in the years ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies in recent years have concluded that stock fund  
investors take a far-too-rosy view of their prospects. But a poll 
taken last fall for MFS Investment Management in Boston suggests 
that that isn't so. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide, surveyed more  
than 1,000 people, including 700 investors. It found that 80 
percent of the respondents expected returns in the 5 percent to 15 
percent range, which fits with the historical record. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 3 percent of the survey participants expected returns  
of 20 percent or beyond. Some 7 percent said they ``didn't know'' 
what return to expect, which could be viewed as the best-informed 
answer of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Other evidence, however, suggests that misguided expectations  
can still be a big problem. A poll taken last month for the 
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards in Denver found more 
than a third of respondents expected that a planner would promise 
to put them into the best-performing stocks and mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Good professional advisers can be of use in many ways, including  
supplying the knowledge and judgment to help people pick 
investments that are consistent with the goals they want to 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody, professional or not, knows which fund or stock is  
going to achieve the best gains in the future. That depends on a 
range of variables, most of which simply can't be predicted by 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Whitman, who runs the Third Avenue Funds group in New  
York, puts it this way: ``The managers of Third Avenue Funds do not 
predict the future, but rather deal in probabilities. Probabilities 
are driven by securities prices as they relate to underlying 
corporate realities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our strong belief that the higher the current market  
price relative to corporate fundamentals, the greater the 
investment risk -- and the lower the current market prices are 
relative to corporate fundamentals, the less the investment risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When you try to put all these pieces together, what is a  
sensible set of expectations about mutual fund investments? Well, 
in a nutshell, that stock funds offer the greatest hope of reward, 
but also the highest risk along the way; that bond funds offer more 
moderate rewards, with more moderate risk, and that money market 
funds promise the smallest rewards along with the least risk. 
</P>
<P>
	A diversified portfolio mixing two or all three of these  
categories covers you against most of the likely future events in 
the world of economics and finance. The key is not to try to figure 
out what will happen in the future, but to adjust the probabilities 
of risk and reward in your own portfolio to suit your goals and 
still permit you to sleep well at night.

<HEADLINE> Island Sale Sped up for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are looking to take Manhattan -- or at  
least nearby Governors Island. At the prodding of some farm-state 
members, the Senate Budget Committee agreed to speed up the sale of 
Governors Island to subsidize improvements in federal crop 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 173-acre island off the tip of Manhattan was a military base  
for more than 300 years until the Coast Guard closed down 
operations in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turning that island over to the private sector would probably  
be a good thing, and heaven knows we need to scratch wherever we 
can to find some additional dollars,'' Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has offered to give it to New York for $1,  
provided it is used for public purposes. But Congress two years ago 
ordered it to be auctioned in 2002 for $500 million as part of a 
plan to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	New York officials have since been struggling to devise a plan  
for developing the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently assigned a task force to pore  
over dozens of development ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can get $500 million, they should take it,'' said  
Giuliani spokesman Curt Ridder. ``We don't think they can achieve 
anything near that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York lawmakers are certain to fight the 2000 deadline, said  
Tony Bullock, an aide to Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., and a member 
of Giuliani's task force. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have needs for the crop insurance program. We have no  
desire to stop them from getting it, but not over the body of 
Governors Island,'' Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the agricultural economy stuck in one of its worst  
downturns in a decade, farm-state lawmakers are working with the 
Clinton administration to expand crop-insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance currently costs the government $1.6 billion a  
year. A five-year budget plan that the Budget Committee approved 
Thursday would nearly double that amount, starting in 2001. Without 
the Governors Island proceeds, there would have been no extra money 
for crop insurance next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It allows us to start the crop insurance reforms next year,''  
said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Details Serb Bombing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton prepared congressional  
leaders today for what one senator called a ``robust and serious'' 
bombing campaign against the Serbs that would soon put American 
military lives in danger. The U.S. Embassy in Belgrade was being 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have them all out within 24 hours,'' a U.S. official  
said of employees of the embassy, noting that other governments 
also were pulling their staffers out of the Yugoslav capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' Sen. Joe  
Biden, D-Del., told reporters at the White House after the 
president's hastily called morning meeting with 31 top-ranking 
members of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us the danger to pilots is real.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``laid out a precise and rational plan as to why we  
would have to participate with NATO and initiate bombing if 
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not sign on to the 
peace agreement,'' said Biden, the first to emerge from the private 
huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must, we must do as we committed -- move forward with a  
bombing campaign.'' After the president's briefing, Biden said, he 
expected that campaign to be ``robust and serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered five Navy  
EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes to fly to Europe from their 
base at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Wash., to rejoin the 
American fleet of warplanes that is preparing for possible 
airstrikes against Yugoslavia. The five Prowlers had been in Europe 
but were sent home in February when the threat of strikes 
dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, there are more than 200 U.S. warplanes in Europe on  
standby for possible strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, nonessential U.S. personnel and their family members  
had departed the Serb capital of Yugoslavia. Their way out was paid 
by the State Department, which did not insist that they leave. 
</P>
<P>
	But overnight, the situation changed, and an order for  
evacuation was set in motion. Some two dozen essential U.S. Embassy 
people were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Before meeting with Clinton, Senate leaders delayed until Monday  
legislation that could block money for any U.S. military 
involvement in the Serbian province without prior congressional 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people need to have a better understanding what  
the United States' national security interests are, if any,'' said 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and other Senate leaders received a briefing Thursday from  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other members of 
Clinton's national security team on the fragile status of peace 
negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in Paris and on the 
continued threat of U.S.-led NATO airstrikes against Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks broke down today and French and British mediators said  
in a statement they won't resume if the Serbs continue to reject 
the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no purpose in extending the talks any further,'' the  
mediators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, as she went into the closed-door briefing with  
lawmakers, said ``NATO stands ready to take whatever measures are 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Lott said he wasn't satisfied -- and requested a  
meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think that the predicate has been laid, that the  
Senate, let alone the American people, know enough about what the 
reasons are for potential airstrikes at this time,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are the risks? What do we hope to achieve? And what  
happens next? I'm just saying that we need to know a lot more than 
we presently have been advised,'' Lott added. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon's top military commanders told a  
Senate hearing that military action against Milosevic's forces 
could be difficult and could result in American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said sentiment in the GOP-led  
Congress had changed from ``qualified support'' for administration 
policy ``to real serious debate over whether we should be heading 
into a long drawn-out campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, a White House spokesman on national security  
issues, said that at today's meeting, Clinton would emphasize 
``that the United States has a clear national interest in 
preventing a wider war from spreading in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes it's important to have strong  
bipartisan consensus here at home as we deliver a strict message to 
President Milosevic that his actions are intolerable and there will 
be further consequences if he does not abide by his obligations and 
agree to a political settlement that guarantees Kosovo's 
autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has warned it will bombard Serbian targets if Milosevic  
continues to resist a proposed three-year settlement to give Kosovo 
autonomy. The latest round of settlement talks in Paris appeared to 
be at an end Thursday, and it was unclear whether any more would be 
held or whether the Serbs would be given a few days to consider 
their position. Yugoslav forces appeared to be mobilizing for 
all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed in a year of fighting in  
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant of two remaining 
republics comprising Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he's prepared to send up to 4,000 Americans  
there as part of a 28,000-member NATO force that would enforce the 
peace -- if a settlement is signed by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's air defenses are sophisticated and heavily  
defended, Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are very good. So taking on these defenses with air  
power will not be easy. There is a distinct possibility we will 
lose aircraft in trying to penetrate those defenses,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be tremendously dangerous,'' Marine Corps  
Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo nine-to-one. But the  
Serbian province remains under Serb control and the military 
directed by Milosevic from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Judge Affirms Hoffa Union Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday affirmed James P.  
Hoffa's election to head the Teamsters union despite a continuing 
probe of other union candidates allied with Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein in New York affirmed a  
federal overseer's decision in January that certification of the 
election results should not be delayed because of charges pending 
against some members of the Hoffa slate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa, son of legendary Teamsters leader James R. Hoffa,  
defeated Tom Leedham in the December contest after a campaign 
finance scandal overturned incumbent president Ron Carey's 1996 
re-election and barred Carey from trying to reclaim the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... look forward to the opportunity, at long last, to lead  
the Teamsters union back to greatness,'' Hoffa said in a statement 
Friday night. ``A reunited, financially sound, corruption-free 
Teamsters will now take its place in the family of labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Election officer Michael Cherkasky certified the results of  
Hoffa's win in January but barred one of Hoffa's running mates from 
taking office and delayed certifying the election results for two 
vice presidency slots representing Canadian locals. 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham had argued that none of the election results should be  
certified until investigations of other candidates on Hoffa's slate 
had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelstein affirmed Election Appeals Master Kenneth Conboy's  
conclusion ``that certain allegations and charges regarding members 
of the Hoffa Slate pending before the Independent Review Board did 
not justify a delay in the certification of the results of the 
(Teamsters) Rerun Election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham argued that Cherkasky was obligated to screen the  
character of candidates ``to preclude candidates who have a 
propensity to abuse power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Justice Department, which has investigated the  
union for years amid charges of corruption and mob influence, last 
week challenged Leedham's characterization of Cherkasky's role. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's office told Edelstein in a letter  
that Cherkasky's job under a consent decree between the union and 
the Justice Department ``is to ensure a fair, honest and open 
election process, not to pass judgment on a candidate's character 
or fitness for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed, upholding the certification results reached by  
the election officer and appeals master. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelstein also affirmed Cherkasky's decision to disqualify J.D.  
Potter from holding office as southern region vice president. The 
judge directed Cherkasky to submit plans by April 1 for a rerun 
election to fill the southern vice presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherkasky had ruled that the Teamsters general executive board  
could fill Potter's position by appointment. Edelstein called that 
decision ``an abuse of his discretion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Review Board had accused Potter, the leader of a  
Texas local, of lying to election officers about breaking donation 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the Teamsters Canada vice presidential contest  
still have not been certified. An investigation is ongoing 
concerning alleged election rule violations there.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Scandal Moves to Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Goodbye, Lake Geneva. Hello,  
Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of the Olympic bribery scandal is shifting back over  
the Atlantic Ocean, now that an emergency meeting of the 
International Olympic Committee has finished with its first steps 
toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up: hearings before the Senate Commerce Committee, where a  
hostile and powerful chairman awaits. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCain, the committee leader and one of the most powerful  
members of Congress, said the changes made during the two-day 
meeting, though radical by IOC standards, ``fall far short of the 
reforms needed to bring transparency and accountability to the 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing I have witnessed provides any substantive movement in  
that direction,'' said McCain, who has issued a series of stinging 
remarks about the IOC this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also saying the IOC needed to do more was its harshest critics  
among corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't hear any reform yet,'' said David D'Alessandro,  
president and chief operations officer of John Hancock insurance. 
``What I heard was they are going to study reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they left their headquarters city by the lake today, IOC  
members could tick off an unprecedented string of major changes as 
they battle to rebound from the million-dollar vote-buying scheme 
that helped Salt Lake City get the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are six members, the first ever expelled from the club.  
Gone, too, is the traditional way the IOC chose host cities, with 
the 2006 Winter Olympic site to be picked from just two finalists 
and no trips to view the venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Added are an ethics commission with the first outside members  
and a reform panel -- IOC 2000 -- that is supposed to draw up a 
radical redesign of a body that, except for its bank balance, has 
changed little in 105 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee leaders said the actions proved they are committed to  
mopping up from the scandal and never letting it happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We promised to clean house. We did it. We promised reforms. We  
did it. We promised an Olympics united. It's done,'' president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch said at a news conference wrapping up the 
extraordinary session. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal, he said, ``is in the past,'' and the IOC is ready  
to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world needs the Olympics Games,'' Samaranch said. ``It is  
the most important event in the world, not just in sports. The 
youth of the world deserve the Olympic Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch pledged the IOC would cooperate with the McCain  
committee, which has scheduled Washington hearings on the Olympic 
scandal for April 14. No IOC officials have been subpoenaed to 
testify so far, but whoever is asked to appear can expect a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said after the expulsions that they alone were  
meaningless if the IOC did not also change at its core. Olympic 
officials said they were hopeful that McCain and other critics 
would take time to look at what the IOC perceives as revolutionary 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope Senator McCain will look at all the other things we  
are doing,'' IOC vice president Anita DeFrantz said. ``The 
expulsions were a beginning, not an end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, McCain's office issued another critical statement,  
and D'Alessandro -- who earlier cut off Olympic ad talks with NBC 
and removed the Olympic Rings from corporate papers -- said progress 
was made -- but not much. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be moving the ball 5 yards,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, the senior Olympic official in the United States, said  
she understood skepticism about the convictions of a 
tradition-bound club to change its stripes, but asked for time and 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one should accept it at face value, just as no one should  
accept it if we came out and said, `Look at us, we're pure.''' she 
said. ``But we hope people will look at the whole panoply of what 
we do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the fact that Samaranch would pick the members and  
serve as chairman of IOC 2000, described as the main engine of 
reform, was ``worrisome at best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the purpose of the new panel is to truly restore the  
integrity of the organization, it must be completely independent 
and its recommendations must be binding,'' the senator said. ``That 
is true of any initiative for reform anywhere in the world.''. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said Samaranch's leadership of the commission was not a  
retreat from change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Presiding over a meeting doesn't mean you make all the  
decisions,'' she said. ``Everything we do will be criticized until 
the first athlete starts competing in Sydney (at the 2000 
Olympics). I accept that is the way it's going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top two officials of the U.S. Olympic Committee, which  
offered less-than-overwhelming support of the IOC's reform efforts 
in recent weeks, said Thursday they were encouraged by what took 
place in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's another step along the road to recovery,'' USOC  
executive director Dick Schultz said. Bill Hybl, the USOC's 
president, said the IOC had ``done what they said they were going 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl also said that Samaranch's promise of cooperation with  
McCain's hearings was ``another positive sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But both USOC officials, in a telephone interview from Colorado  
Springs, Colo., said more needed to be done. Each offered his No. 1 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Term limits'' on IOC members now appointed for life, Schultz  
said. ``I think they are very healthy in an organization and could 
have avoided some of the troubles of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl called for ``accountability of the organization, both  
actual and perceived.'' He said Thursday's release of the IOC's 
first fully public audit in four years showed ``they are starting 
down the road to full accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those records, from the accounting firm of  
PricewaterhouseCoopers, showed the IOC with a $136 million net 
worth and a $40 million operating surplus last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For years IOC members have been pictured as a bunch of  
international sports vagabonds, addicted to hotel suites and 
caviar. The audit showed the living to be somewhat lower-level, 
although still pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch's living arrangements when he is in Lausanne cost the  
IOC $204,000 last year, the report said. He does not draw a salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Members get $150 a day plus room, board and airfare when they  
attend committee meetings, including the Olympics. The 11 executive 
board members receive $1,000 per meeting, weather three days or 
three weeks long, but have all expenses paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch described it as ``pocket money.''  
</P>
<P>
	The ex-wife of embattled IOC member Phil Coles of Australia told  
the committee today that the couple received jewelry from a Greek 
businessman connected with Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Games. 
The diamond-and-gold jewelry -- a necklace and cufflinks turned into 
earrings, all valued at $6,300 -- is at the heart of the latest 
allegations that Coles repeatedly violated rules limiting gifts 
from bid cities to $150. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of one top Olympic sponsor says corporations would put  
their money elsewhere if Congress stripped tax deductions for games 
marketing. D'Alessandro said that pending legislation would push 
the cost of deals with the IOC too high.

<HEADLINE>  Gordon Wins Darlington Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon, looking to establish  
early-season dominance, took another step in that direction Friday 
by winning the pole for the TranSouth 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, with two victories in four starts this year and five in  
his last seven outings at Darlington Raceway, ran the third-fastest 
lap in the history of NASCAR's oldest superspeedway. He went 
173.167 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' said Gordon, who wanted to build momentum  
after winning five days earlier at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``The 
car was just right, and I gave it everything I had. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably the most confidence I've had in a race car in  
a long time. I knew I could drive into the first turn really hard, 
and that's one of the keys to qualifying here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has emphasized the importance of starting near the front of  
the field on a track Winston Cup drivers consider the most 
difficult of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, seeking to tie a record by winning his third straight  
title and fourth overall, covered the 1.366-mile oval in 28.398 
seconds in a Chevrolet. What was so impressive was that he came 
close to the record Ward Burton set at 173.797 three years ago -- 
after the track had been repaved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon had the second-fastest speed behind Burton on the record  
qualifying run of 1996, and was able to break 173 again because of 
his approach to qualifying on what is called ``the track to tough 
to tame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the speed I carried through the first two turns was as  
fast as anybody could go,'' he said. ``After we got through three 
and four, I knew is was a fast lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was capable of more than I was.''  
</P>
<P>
	Burton, one of the best qualifiers on the circuit, had a bad  
run. He was just 28th and, with only the top 25 spots locked in, 
will have to try again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just real disappointed,'' he said. ``We're definitely  
better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surprising second was Johnny Benson, who took the outside of  
the front row in a Ford with a lap of 172.541. His teammate, Mark 
Martin, who earlier in the day won the pole for the Busch series 
Diamond Hill 200 on Saturday, will start third off a speed of 
171.878. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't ask for a better lap,'' Benson said. ``I was going  
to be happy just to be in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was satisfied with his lap, although he wondered at first  
if he would finish it on a day when so many cars had problems in 
both Winston Cup and Busch Grand National practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty loose there on that lap, and it took my breath  
away,'' Martin said. ``I'm still a little bit in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth was the Chevrolet of points leader Mike Skinner at  
171.830, followed by John Andretti's Pontiac at 171.782. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 25th pole of Gordon's career and second at  
Darlington, where he has won the Southern 500 a record four times 
in a row in addition to his 1996 victory in the TranSouth 400. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Gordon Wins Darlington Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon, looking to establish  
early-season dominance, took another step in that direction Friday 
by winning the pole for the TranSouth 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, with two victories in four starts this year and five in  
his last seven outings at Darlington Raceway, ran the third-fastest 
lap in the history of NASCAR's oldest superspeedway. He went 
173.167 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' said Gordon, who wanted to build momentum  
after winning five days earlier at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``The 
car was just right, and I gave it everything I had. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably the most confidence I've had in a race car in  
a long time. I knew I could drive into the first turn really hard, 
and that's one of the keys to qualifying here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has emphasized the importance of starting near the front of  
the field on a track Winston Cup drivers consider the most 
difficult of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, seeking to tie a record by winning his third straight  
title and fourth overall, covered the 1.366-mile oval in 28.398 
seconds in a Chevrolet. What was so impressive was that he came 
close to the record Ward Burton set at 173.797 three years ago -- 
after the track had been repaved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon had the second-fastest speed behind Burton on the record  
qualifying run of 1996, and was able to break 173 again because of 
his approach to qualifying on what is called ``the track to tough 
to tame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the speed I carried through the first two turns was as  
fast as anybody could go,'' he said. ``After we got through three 
and four, I knew is was a fast lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was capable of more than I was.''  
</P>
<P>
	Burton, one of the best qualifiers on the circuit, had a bad  
run. He was just 28th and, with only the top 25 spots locked in, 
will have to try again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just real disappointed,'' he said. ``We're definitely  
better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surprising second was Johnny Benson, who took the outside of  
the front row in a Ford with a lap of 172.541. His teammate, Mark 
Martin, who earlier in the day won the pole for the Busch series 
Diamond Hill 200 on Saturday, will start third off a speed of 
171.878. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't ask for a better lap,'' Benson said. ``I was going  
to be happy just to be in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was satisfied with his lap, although he wondered at first  
if he would finish it on a day when so many cars had problems in 
both Winston Cup and Busch Grand National practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty loose there on that lap, and it took my breath  
away,'' Martin said. ``I'm still a little bit in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth was the Chevrolet of points leader Mike Skinner at  
171.830, followed by John Andretti's Pontiac at 171.782. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 25th pole of Gordon's career and second at  
Darlington, where he has won the Southern 500 a record four times 
in a row in addition to his 1996 victory in the TranSouth 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett, hoping to tie David Pearson's mark of three  
straight victories in the Darlington spring race, qualified 21st in 
a Ford. He was not happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best we've been today, but that's not saying

<HEADLINE> Foley Traded to Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- New York Jets quarterback Glenn Foley, who lost  
his job last season to Vinny Testaverde, was traded Friday to the 
Seattle Seahawks for a seventh round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glenn is a fierce competitor with a good understanding of the  
game,'' said new Seattle coach and general manager Mike Holmgren. 
``He's a natural leader who we think fits our system and will be a 
positive influence on this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, 28, was a seventh-round draft choice out of Boston  
College in 1994. He will back up and perhaps challenge Seattle's 
starting quarterback, Jon Kitna. In New York, he started eight 
games in five seasons and is 1-7 as a starter. He lost each of his 
three '98 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, he completed 192 of 349 attempts for 2,186  
yards, 10 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Friday that he was  
happy to be moving to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look across the league, there's obviously a lot of places to  
go. But this was the one I really had my eye on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley just signed a two-year deal with the Jets worth $1.75  
million, and he will bring that contract to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren also is expected to pick a quarterback in the draft --  
perhaps using the team's first-round selection, 17th overall.

<HEADLINE> Nissan Nears Decision on Renault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. moved closer Friday to a deal  
meant to ensure its survival by surrendering some control to a 
foreign company in exchange for an infusion of badly needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
	So embarrassed is Japan's No. 2 automaker about having to turn  
to France's Renault SA for help that chairman Yoshifumi Tsuji has 
decided to resign to take responsibility, Japanese news reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan spokesman Masataka Saito refused to comment on the  
reports. But Nissan did say that its board will make a decision on 
March 27 about Renault's bid to buy a 35 percent stake in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``A potential business tie-up with Renault will give Nissan  
significant benefits and synergies in many areas,'' Nissan's 
president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese news reports said Nissan's board will almost certainly  
vote to accept the offer, valued by analysts at about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign automakers have bought stakes in other Japanese car  
makers, but not in the largest ones such as Nissan. Ford Motor owns 
a controlling minority stake in Mazda Motor, and General Motors 
recently increased its stake in Isuzu Motors to 49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The past year has seen a series of major cross-border  
consolidations in the auto industry. Ford announced in January it 
was buying the passenger car operations of Volvo AB, Daimler-Benz 
AG bought Chrysler Corp. last year, and General Motors Corp. is in 
talks with Saab Automobile AB to buy the 50 percent of Saab that it 
doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan ranks seventh in the world in production of cars and  
trucks and Renault is No. 11, according to Ward's Automotive 
International, an industry newsletter. If the two merged -- which is 
not being proposed -- the combined business would rank fourth in 
terms of production and fifth in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been seeking a foreign investor to help it return to  
profitability. The carmaker has lost money in five of the last six 
years, and it forecasts losing another $250 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan got into trouble by trying to compete with stronger rival  
Toyota Motor Corp. head-to-head in almost every segment of Japan's 
auto market. It now appears likely that Nissan will cut the number 
of model types it makes from its current 25 to as few as five and 
focus more on products that can earn money. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance would give Renault a premier distribution system in  
Asia as well as access to Nissan's superior technology in engines, 
suspension, batteries and fuel cells. Nissan would, in turn, get a 
desperately needed cash infusion, better European distribution and 
management talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's board met Friday to discuss Renault's offer but decided  
to postpone the vote as lawyers were still trying to work out 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	After a deal is struck, Nissan's chairman will offer his  
resignation at the company's next shareholder meeting in late June, 
Japan's state-run NHK television and the Kyodo News agency 
reported. Tsuji, 71, will step down out of contrition for putting 
Nissan in the position of surrendering management autonomy to a 
foreign company, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of Renault's bid, the French carmaker would  
install one of its own executives in Nissan's No. 2 management 
spot. Renault employees would also fill another one or two seats on 
Nissan's board.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan Improves, Takes Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan is  
recovering from prostate cancer treatment and a case of flu and 
will take a four-month sabbatical from leading his group, his 
personal physician said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minister's life is not in imminent danger from any medical  
cause,'' Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``This should serve notice to all of the vultures who are  
hovering over what they expect to be a dead carcass that you can go 
home,'' he said. ``There is no death vigil. This is no death 
watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was first treated for prostate cancer in 1991.  
His most recent treatment, combined with two recent bouts of the 
flu, anemia and his hectic schedule, left him in need of a break, 
Muhammad said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there was no sign of cancer in his body except in the  
prostate and a nearby sac. ``Some of you who have black hair now -- 
your hair will be silver before he leaves the scene,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was not at the news conference. The Muslim group's  
leaders, citing security concerns, declined to disclose his 
location beyond saying that he is not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Concern about Farrakhan's health began after the Nation of  
Islam's newspaper, The Final Call, reported Farrakhan had fallen 
ill in early January with an undiagnosed condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan was quoted as saying the current illness ``took me  
down so fast, that it concerned me greatly because, though I'm 
nearing 66, I have never been sick like this in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a Feb. 28 speech in Chicago, Farrakhan said he lost 20  
pounds and most of his muscle mass in less than two weeks and had 
``no appetite, night sweats, dealing with the after-effects of 
radiation therapy (for prostate cancer) and other things,'' the 
newspaper reported in a March 10 update on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has often sparked controversy with his outspoken  
support of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, whom he has visited 
several times, and his negative comments about Jews, Christians, 
white people and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan reportedly was treated for prostate cancer by  
Gadhafi's doctors after announcing he had the illness in 1991. He 
most recently met with Gadhafi in November -- his fifth visit to 
Libya in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	His personal physician, however, denied at today's news  
conference that Farrakhan had ever been treated for cancer in 
Libya. He said that normal tests in connection with his cancer 
treatment were performed at a hospital in Tripoli while Farrakhan 
was on a world tour.

<HEADLINE>  Iraq Ships Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARAR, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Iraq packed 18,000 destitute pilgrims  
onto buses without tents, food or warm gear today and sent the 
convoy rolling into Saudi Arabia -- a challenge the kingdom could 
not ignore, or win. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi border guards stepped aside at their checkpoints to let  
nearly 400 buses and trucks pass, and by day's end King Fahd agreed 
not only to accept the illegal arrivals but also to pay all their 
expenses for a religious pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a daring move for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, one  
that had threatened to deeply embarrass the Saudi king if it 
appeared he had failed to aid needy fellow Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	For when it comes to the hajj, Islam's most sacred ritual, even  
political divisions as deep as those between Iraq and Saudi Arabia 
must be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	The two neighbors have had no formal relations since Iraq's 1990  
invasion of Kuwait, and -- much to Saddam's annoyance -- Saudi Arabia 
is a solid supporter of harsh U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after 
the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Saudis historically have welcomed all pilgrims making  
the journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Sending back 
the Iraqis, regardless of Baghdad's motivations, could have been 
perceived as putting national interests ahead of religious 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Six hours after the pilgrims entered the kingdom, the official  
Saudi News Agency announced that King Fahd had ordered all of the 
pilgrims milling about in the desert border town of Arar to be 
allowed in and be bused to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	The unprecedented illegal entry -- many of the pilgrims arrived  
without passports -- was a step toward fulfilling their prayers of 
getting to Mecca and their Islamic duty of making the hajj. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if the Saudis allow me to do the pilgrimage on foot, I am  
ready,'' said one of the Iraqis, Mohammed al-Duleimi. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to say. I am so happy that I want to cry,''  
said another, Jalil Jabr. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the pilgrims were elderly and already had spent two  
nights camped on the Iraqi side of the border, where temperatures 
in the desert dipped to near freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilgrims, who were led by senior Iraqi officials, drove  
through two checkpoints and did not stop until reaching Arar. 
</P>
<P>
	Many called out ``Allahu akbar!'' or ``God is great'' as they  
passed the dozen or so Saudi border guards. 
</P>
<P>
	As the hours passed -- and lines to the three public toilets grew  
to hundreds long -- the Iraqis grew tired and nervous. They had no 
food, and most had no money. 
</P>
<P>
	A few pilgrims carrying small amounts of Saudi or U.S. currency  
bought Pepsi or crackers from shopkeepers -- astounded at prices 
double or more those in Iraq. Shopkeepers in Arar would not accept 
Iraqi dinars. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pilgrims wondered how they would spend the night in Saudi  
Arabia if a decision on whether they could proceed was not reached 
quickly. Their tents and most blankets remained on the Iraqi side 
of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	But by late Friday afternoon, Saudi authorities had begun taking  
pilgrims on the 18-hour bus ride from Arar to the holy city of 
Mecca. There, they were expected to be assigned to tents set up for 
hajj pilgrims, fed and allowed to carry out their religious duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Able-bodied Muslims who can afford it are required to make the  
pilgrimage to the Mecca and Medina at least once in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Saddam even managed to sidestep the United Nations with his bus  
convoy -- which followed failed attempts to agree on a U.N. 
sanctions committee plan for funding the pilgrimages of 22,000 
Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq had wanted the money deposited in its central bank; the  
committee insisted on a voucher system and travelers checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Baghdad also sent three planeloads of pilgrims to Saudi Arabia  
this year in violation of the U.N. sanctions, which ban air travel 
to or from Iraq. The Saudis allowed the pilgrims, whose paperwork 
was in order, to continue their journey, but briefly detained two 
of the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was released Thursday, and the second on Friday after  
Saudi authorities at King Abdel-Aziz International Airport in 
Jiddah finished interrogating the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane and its 18-member crew took off Friday for Iraq after  
crew members promised not to repeat such flights, Saudi officials 
said on customary condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures rose Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by rumors of reduced crop estimates 
out of South America and hopes the United States government may 
take some action to assist soybean farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were limited, however, by uncertainty over the South  
American figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures followed soybeans higher, but received pressure  
from news of rainfall in parts of the central United States, where 
the hard red winter wheat crop is considered to be in good 
condition already. Wheat futures had fallen sharply Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also news that the Chinese wheat belt has received  
rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also rose amid speculation that a credit line  
allowing South Korea to purchase more corn could be approved next 
week. Also supportive were rumors that U.S. acres will be lower 
this year. The gains were kept in check by news that China is 
getting more aggressive in offering corn for export. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery was up 2 cents to $2.75 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn was up 4 3/4 cents to $2.29 a bushel; May oats were up 2 cents to 
$1.13 a bushel; May soybeans were up 7 1/4 cents to $4.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and feeder cattle futures were lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while lean hogs and pork bellies both posted 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures fell 0.50 cent to 66.65 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle were off 0.18 cent to 71.82 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs were up 0.53 cent to 42.80 cents a pound; and May 
pork bellies were up 0.55 cent to 51.45 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Court to Reconsider Student Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The federal appeals court for nine Western  
states today withdrew a ruling allowing students to lead prayers at 
high school graduation. The issue will be heard again by a larger 
panel of judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals upheld the policy of heavily Mormon school district in 
Idaho that allows the top students in each senior class to decide 
whether to include a prayer in their graduation speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said no one's rights were violated as long as the  
students were free to decide on the prayer without interference 
from the district. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the appeals court said Friday a majority of its active  
judges had voted to refer the case to an 11-judge panel for a new 
hearing. The court apparently took the vote at the request of one 
of its judges; there was no record of a request for a rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Lynch, a lawyer for the Madison, Idaho, school  
district, said he wasn't sure what issues the judges wanted to 
consider. He declined comment on the court's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Pevar, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer whose  
clients challenged the policy, said he was surprised and cautiously 
hopeful. Pevar said his clients were two non-Mormon students who 
felt ``like outcasts'' at graduation ceremonies.

<HEADLINE>  Tokyo Market's Key Index Recovers / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index recovered to  
an eight-month high on a rally in blue chips today, rebounding from 
the previous day's sharp drop. The dollar slid against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.52 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.00  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 117.45 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 660.86  
points, or 4.20 percent, closing the week at 16,378.78 points -- its 
highest close since July 31. On Thursday, the average closed down 
550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, after hitting an eight-month high 
on Wednesday. Today's high was just a tick above that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	While today's rally was partially in reaction to Thursday's  
sharp drop, traders said investors were encouraged by continued 
corporate restructuring by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors were large net buyers on the growing view that  
Japan's economy may have hit bottom, traders said. The rise in New 
York stocks overnight was another bullish factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 six times  
Thursday before closing at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 867  
million shares, down from Thursday's turnover of 1.30 billion 
shares. Advances outnumbered retreats 899 to 314, with 111 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among today's gainers were blue chips, including Sony Corp.,  
Toyota Motor Corp. and Kyocera. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 38.52 points, or 3.13 percent, to 1,269.76. 
The TOPIX lost 28.85 points, or 2.29 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slid as overseas investors  
bought yen to invest in rising Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just short-term foreign speculators but also  
long-term investors such as U.S. mutual and pension funds who are 
selling dollars for yen to invest in Japanese stocks,'' said Shuji 
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But other players retreated to the sidelines prior to a  
three-day weekend in Japan. The dollar ranged between 116.90 yen 
and 117.80 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Monday, March 22, for  
Spring Equinox Day, a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.36 yen, down  
from 130.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.665 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.685 percent, 
driving its price up 101.08 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Pay Cuba Shootdown Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The families of three men shot down by Cuban jets  
over international waters have won a $6.2 million judgment, but say 
justice won't be served until those responsible for the deaths are 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue fighting until the criminals are jailed. This  
is our prime objective,'' said Miriam de la Pena, whose son was 
killed. ``Our goal is to have criminals behind bars. We will not go 
away until we reach that reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge James King on Thursday ordered the  
money, owed to Cuba by U.S. phone companies, to be paid instead to 
the families of three of the four men killed in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, sure to be appealed by the State Department, means  
direct phone service between the United States and Cuba through 
several U.S. carriers will remain severed for now. 
</P>
<P>
	King ruled that President Clinton did not have the authority to  
waive a new anti-terrorism law allowing the families of three of 
four fliers to receive blocked Cuban assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The families won a $187 million judgment against the Republic of  
Cuba and the Cuban Air Force in 1997, but were unable to collect 
because of Clinton's waiver and State Department objections. 
</P>
<P>
	The families say the ruling not only gives them a portion of the  
money they want from the Cuban government but the impetus to 
continue their legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to get it all,'' said Aaron Podhurst, an attorney  
for the families. 
</P>
<P>
	Four members of the Miami-based group Brothers to the Rescue  
were searching for Cuban refugees on rafts when Cuban MiGs shot 
down their private planes in the Florida Straits on Feb. 24, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the men were U.S. citizens. Their families plan to  
share any money received with relatives of the fourth man. 
</P>
<P>
	The families received $300,000 each in November 1996 that the  
U.S. government plucked from frozen Cuban accounts, calling it a 
humanitarian gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	The $6.2 million comes from payments for long-distance calls  
from U.S. telephone companies to Cuba's phone company -- Empresa de 
Telecommunicaciones de Cuba S.A., or ETECSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba severed most phone service to the United States on Feb. 25  
because the U.S. phone companies had withheld payment since 
December, pending King's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. have carriers rerouted calls to the island, apparently  
through third countries or onto Sprint telephone lines, which were 
not affected. AT&AMP;T said it will continue the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T and MCI owe ETECSA about $4.1 million and $1.05 million,  
respectively. Spokesman for AT&AMP;T and MCI would not comment on the 
judges ruling.

<HEADLINE> Charges vs. First Lady Were Drafted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The chief deputy for Whitewater  
prosecutor Kenneth Starr testified that he drew up a draft 
indictment of Hillary Rodham Clinton after concluding that she and 
the president had been dishonest and untruthful. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Thursday in Whitewater figure Susan McDougal's criminal  
contempt trial if he ever had said the Clintons were ``crooks and 
liars,'' W. Hickman Ewing said he had ``made that statement 
in-house'' to another member of Starr's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had to do with conflicting stories given by people in the  
Rose Law Firm'' about work Mrs. Clinton did for Madison Guaranty 
Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;L was owned by Mrs. McDougal's late husband, James  
McDougal, who was partner with then-Gov. Bill Clinton and Mrs. 
Clinton in the Whitewater land development. Questions were raised 
over whether Clinton had asked McDougal to take his legal business 
to the Little Rock firm where Mrs. Clinton was a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, however, Ewing added: ``I don't believe I used  
the L-word or the C-word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said that at dinner one evening with other Starr aides he  
graded the president and the first lady on their responses to 
questioning by Whitewater investigators, after observing her 
answers during a July 1995 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said the president was about a `C' and Mrs. Clinton about an  
'F,''' Ewing testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave those grades, he said, after Mrs. Clinton said ``I don't  
recall'' about 50 times during the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing did not say what charge might have been included in an  
indictment of Mrs. Clinton, and said no such indictment was ever 
presented to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's private lawyer, discounted Ewing's  
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere fact that this prosecutor's office drafted a  
frivolous indictment three years ago has no significance 
whatsoever,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, called Ewing as his first  
witness as he continued his strategy of putting the conduct of 
Starr and his deputies on trial. Mrs. McDougal is charged with 
refusing to answer questions posed by Starr's office before a 
Whitewater grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos is trying to demonstrate that prosecutors wanted to use  
Mrs. McDougal to get to the Clintons, even if there was not enough 
evidence to charge them. Mrs. McDougal says she refused to testify 
because she was convinced she would be charged with perjury even if 
she testified truthfully. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial continues Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said he arranged a meeting in May 1995 with Mrs.  
McDougal's lawyer at the time, Bobby McDaniel, to explore 
possibilities for her cooperation with the Whitewater prosecutor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Mr. McDaniel talked about total immunity ... and we  
were not in a position at that time to agree to that,'' Ewing said. 
Instead, he said, he and two assistants at the meeting suggested 
that McDaniel or his client make an offer specifying what Mrs. 
McDougal would be able to testify about, so the Whitewater 
prosecutor's office might consider making a deal by letting Mrs. 
McDougal plead guilty to a relatively minor charge. 
</P>
<P>
	But no such offer was ever forthcoming from Mrs. McDougal or her  
lawyer, Ewing said. Her position was that she had done nothing 
wrong, he said, and would therefore not agree to plead guilty to 
any charge, even a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said he drew up the draft indictment against Mrs. Clinton  
sometime after September 1996. Early that year, Mrs. Clinton's 
long-sought law firm billing records mysteriously surfaced in the 
White House, revealing that she had worked on a failed land 
development that James McDougal was trying to use to prop up his 
failing S&AMP;L. 
</P>
<P>
	Until those records emerged following their disappearance during  
the 1992 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton had not revealed work 
she had done on the McDougals' Castle Grande development, which 
federal regulators said was riddled with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing also said the president had changed his responses to  
questions about whether he had asked McDougal to hire Mrs. 
Clinton's law firm to represent Madison Guaranty in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related matter Thursday, a federal judge in Washington  
dismissed one of Starr's criminal counts against presidential 
friend Webster Hubbell in a fraud indictment. The count accused 
Hubbell of scheming to conceal work done by him and Mrs. Clinton, 
his former law partner at the Rose Law Firm, on the Castle Grand 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson agreed with Hubbell that the  
allegations in the count were too vague. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr had obtained a 15-count indictment of Hubbell in November  
in connection with Castle Grande. Federal regulators said the deal 
was riddled with ``insider dealing, fictitious sales and land 
flips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was referred to 36 times in the original indictment  
against Hubbell, signifying that her name could be brought up 
repeatedly in the trial set to begin June 14.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Anticipate Rodman's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers expect Dennis Rodman  
to return to the team shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, with Rodman, there's no guarantee.  
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman John Black told The Associated Press several  
hours before the Lakers faced the Cleveland Cavaliers at Gund Arena 
on Thursday night that Rodman spoke with executive vice president 
Jerry West and general manager Mitch Kupchak earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, he's making some progress taking care of the  
personal business he needs to take care of,'' Black said. ``We 
expect him to rejoin us sometime soon, in the not-too-distant 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game against Cleveland was the first of four in five days  
for the Lakers, who play at Philadelphia tonight, Orlando on Sunday 
and Dallas on Monday night to complete a six-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected Rodman to rejoin the Lakers before the team  
heads home, Black replied, ``That we're not sure of; hopefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Rodman continues to be paid for the games he's missed  
-- the game at Cleveland was the third since Rodman told the Lakers 
he needed time off to deal with personal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, coach Kurt Rambis said Rodman will be fined.  
</P>
<P>
	``That will be handled internally,'' was Black's only comment on  
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about what I don't have,'' Rambis said. ``If  
he's here, he's going to be used. If he's not, I can't moan about 
it. It doesn't do me any good. It doesn't do the team any good. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's at practice, great. When he's at a game, great.  
When's he's not there, I don't let if faze me. I don't let it 
disrupt the team. We just keep moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Matt Labov, a spokesman for the Beverly Hills firm of  
Baker-Winokur-Ryder, hired earlier this week as Rodman's publicist, 
said Thursday there was nothing new to report as far as the player 
was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when asked about a report in the Daily News of Los  
Angeles that quoted a source as saying Rodman was in Cancun, 
Mexico, Labov replied, ``That's completely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was also reported earlier in the week that Rodman spent time  
in Las Vegas since the Lakers left Los Angeles without him last 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Nuke Power Ambivalence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer than half of Americans say they support  
using nuclear power to produce electricity and an increasing number 
of people admit they don't know what they think about it, according 
to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, taken 20 years after a serious accident at the Three  
Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., found 45 percent of 
adults saying they support the use of nuclear energy. That is down 
10 percentage points from a 1989 AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent in the latest poll say they believe nuclear plants  
are safer now, but half the respondents believe a serious nuclear 
accident is likely at a U.S. power plant. Those numbers are about 
the same as in the 1989 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear power industry supplies about 20 percent of the  
nation's energy. No new plants are being built in this country and 
many existing facilities are seeking relicensing. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in three people surveyed said they oppose the use of  
nuclear power, while one in four said they didn't know. The 
percentage in opposition was the same a decade ago, but the number 
who said they didn't know where they stood on the issue was twice 
as high as it was in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Men were more likely than women to support nuclear power,  
according to the poll, conducted by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think it will work,'' said 73-year-old Jim Bissey, a  
cashier from Springfield, Ohio. ``We have nuclear submarines and 
other nuclear devices that seem to work OK. I'm hoping that 
technology has moved forward so that whatever happened at Three 
Mile Island they can control or eliminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 28, 1979, a series of failures cut off the flow of  
cooling water to the reactor, which caused the top half of the 
reactor's radioactive core to collapse and melt. Contaminated 
coolant water escaped into a nearby building, releasing radioactive 
gases. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,015 people was taken Friday through  
Tuesday. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a majority of those who support the use of nuclear power  
said they wouldn't want to live within 10 miles of a plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen enough evidence to be anti-nuclear power,''  
said Kirsten Hoffman, 33, of Corpus Christi, Texas. ``But it's the 
old NIMBY syndrome -- not in my back yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials say the 1990s are good times for nuclear  
power, even though no orders for new plants have been placed in 
more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Peterson, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute,  
said the industry has ``more than 100 nuclear power plants 
operating at record levels of efficiency and safety.'' He sees the 
environmental debate over pollution from coal and oil plants as a 
significant boost for nuclear power and said that in another decade 
there may be an appetite for more large-scale plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The storage of radioactive waste continues to be an  
environmental concern, with almost half in the poll saying they 
believe it cannot be safely stored for many years. One-third said 
they thought it could be safely stored. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing nuclear plants may be able to compete economically  
with other types of plants in energy production costs, said Tom 
Cochran, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
But Cochran said the prohibitive cost of building new plants could 
reduce the amount of nuclear power in another couple of decades. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be fine with Dianne Carr, a 42-year-old Sharpsburg,  
Md., resident who vividly remembers news reports about the Three 
Mile Island accident in neighboring Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nuclear power is pretty scary,'' she said. ``I remember  
reading about evacuation plans for cities after Three Mile Island, 
and it was mind-boggling.''

<HEADLINE> China Scholar Doak Barnett Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A. Doak Barnett, 77, one of the nation's  
foremost scholars and advisers on China who pushed for renewed 
relations with the Asian country, died March 17 at Georgetown 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered from lung cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Born in Shanghai to missionaries, Barnett went on to author or  
edit more than 20 books on China and to play an influential role in 
shaping U.S. policy in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	After a long period of severed ties between the two nations,  
Barnett advocated in 1966 that the United States reevaluate its 
overall approach to communist China. At a key Senate hearing on the 
issue that year, Barnett called for ``a policy of containment but 
not isolation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's thinking gained support with President Lyndon B.  
Johnson, as China split from its alliance with the Soviet Union, 
and laid the groundwork for eventual renewal of relations initiated 
by President Richard Nixon.

<HEADLINE> 2 Bodies Found in Sightseer Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities searching for three  
women who vanished last month after a visit to Yosemite National 
Park found two bodies in the trunk of their badly burned rental 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies were not immediately identified, and the cause of  
death was not released, James Maddock, the FBI agent in charge of 
the investigation, said today. There was no sign of a third victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI believes Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Julie Sund, 15,  
and their Argentine friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, were either 
kidnapped or carjacked late Feb. 15 or 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The red Pontiac Grand Prix they rented was found burned Thursday  
in a remote area about 100 yards off a highway. The bodies were 
discovered Friday morning, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund's father, Francis Carrington, said in a brief and  
tearful statement Friday that he wants justice served so that no 
other family must face the same tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find the animals that did this. They're terrible  
people. We don't want them to do this to anyone else's daughter or 
granddaughter,'' Mrs. Sund's mother, Carole Carrington, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrington, whose family made millions in Northern California  
real estate and now mostly lives in Eureka, had offered a $300,000 
reward for information leading to their safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Jens Sund, Carole's husband and Julie's father, was with his  
other children in Eureka on Friday when he got the news, said 
family friend Lee Ulansey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a horrifying situation,'' Ulansey said. ``We hoped  
for the best, but expected the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI believes whoever torched and abandoned the car knew the  
area, which is accessible only by narrow, muddy, logging roads 
hidden by dense woods. It's often used by locals as a dumping 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot where the victims were found is nearly three hours away  
from Cedar Lodge in El Portal, at the western entrance to Yosemite. 
The last confirmed sighting of the women was at the lodge's 
restaurant, on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Shopkeepers in the town of Twain Harte, near where the car was  
found and just west of Yosemite, said they had called the FBI to 
report seeing the women a day later on Feb. 16, but initially 
didn't get a response. 
</P>
<P>
	Penny Mann, owner of the Cedar Cottage gift shop, said she  
believes the three visited her shop that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gone over this so many times,'' Mrs. Mann said Friday.  
``I'm sure it was them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she called the FBI hotline about three days later but  
couldn't get through. After talking to friends and family, she 
called again about a week ago and passed her information on to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Mrs. Sund's wallet was found along the side of a road in  
Modesto, two hours west of Yosemite, on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Guthmiller, who owns a gas station about a mile from  
where the car was found, believes she sold the women a small amount 
of gas. She said Friday that she didn't know what day that 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Guthmiller told the Stockton Record she asked the group if they  
were on their way home, and one of the women -- she believes it was 
Silvina -- said, ``No, I'm from Argentina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guthmiller said she called the FBI more than a dozen times to  
report the information but never got through. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock wouldn't comment today on the additional sightings in  
the area where the car was found. ``There is not much more 
information, frankly, that we can or will release,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: US Must Have 'Will To Act' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With NATO air strikes looming, President  
Clinton today spelled out the need for risky American military 
action in Kosovo if Serbian leaders are bent on aggression. The 
allied nations must act, he said, because ``hesitation is a license 
to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we and our allies don't have the will to act, there will be  
more massacres,'' Clinton declared, acknowledging at the same time 
that ``U.S. and other NATO pilots will be put in harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first full-fledged news conference in nearly a year,  
Clinton also acknowledged that he had lied to the American people 
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky but called that just ``one 
negative'' that should be balanced against hundreds of good deeds. 
He noted that many allegations against him had been proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of George Washington's legendary statement that he  
could not tell a lie, Clinton said children can learn from his 
mistakes that people must tell the truth. ``I think that what young 
people will learn from my experience is that even presidents have 
to do that and there are consequences when you don't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also dealt with a mounting controversy over alleged  
spying at U.S. nuclear installations. A Chinese-American working at 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was fired after 
allegations arose that secret information about nuclear weapons was 
given to the Chinese. The president denied that the administration 
reacted too slowly or out of political motivation in light of 
Chinese-Americans contributions to Democratic campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he said security measures at nuclear research  
laboratories have been too weak for ``years and years and years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid growing speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's possible  
political plans, the president said ``I literally don't have a 
clue'' whether his wife will run for a Senate seat in New York. He 
said she told him a year ago it might be a good idea to move to New 
York after they leave the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He said their marriage is still strong, despite a year of  
revelations about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. ``We're working 
hard. We love each other very much and we're working on it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, he declined to comment on a Little Rock, Ark.,  
woman's allegation that he sexually assaulted her when he was 
Arkansas' attorney general 21 years ago. His attorney denied the 
allegation in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He speaks for me,'' Clinton said. ``I think he spoke quite  
clearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a light moment, the president was asked why his enemies  
always pick on him. He told a long story in which God tells a man 
complaining about his fortunes: ``Son, there's just something about 
you I don't like.'' More seriously, Clinton said he feels he has 
lived a blessed life and enjoys being president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton brushed off personal criticisms leveled at him in books  
written by two former close associates, political adviser Dick 
Morris and counselor George Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had any pain since I haven't read any of the  
books,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Clinton tried to increase pressure on the Serb-led  
Yugoslav government led by President Slobodan Milosevic, declaring, 
``Only President Milosevic stands in the way of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They have massed their troops. They have continued to take  
aggressive action. They have already leveled one village in the 
recent past, killed a lot of innocent people. I do not believe that 
we ought to have thousands more people slaughtered and buried in 
open soccer fields before we do something. I think that would be 
unfortunate, if we said we have to have a lot more victims before 
we can stop what we know is about to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly concerned about the possible conflict, Clinton said: ``I  
do not want to put a single American pilot in the air. I do not 
want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not want a conflict. I 
would give anything to be hear talking about something else. But a 
part of my responsibility is to try to leave to my successors an 
environment in Europe that is stable, humane and secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Serbs have had enough time to agree to peace,  
the president said, ``I think that threshold has been crossed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Defended Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the Democratic  
presidential nomination and faces allegations of padding his resume 
by claiming to have created the Internet. Clinton said Gore 
deserves ``a lot of appreciation'' for his efforts to promote the 
global computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he was concerned that the skyrocketing stock market  
appeared to be contributing to the dip in Americans' savings rates, 
and that those falling rates pose a threat to continued economic 
good times. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he was taking a back seat to Attorney General Janet Reno  
in the debate over whether the independent counsel law should be 
allowed to expire because he was a target of Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr's investigation.

<HEADLINE> Albright Backs Dobbins on Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior American diplomat assigned recently  
to oversee U.S. policy in the Balkans on Thursday denied 
allegations he may have lied to Congress about death squads in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who recruited  
him from the White House's national security staff, James F. 
Dobbins produced documents that showed he was cleared in 1998 of 
accusations of intentionally misleading the House International 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a letter criticizing the way he testified was placed in  
his file that year. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department's inspector general, Jacquelyn L.  
Williams-Bridgers, had found Dobbins ``acted with reckless 
disregard'' in his testimony in 1995 about an FBI investigation 
into the murder of a right-wing critic of President Jean-Bernard 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
	Her investigation was undertaken at the request of Rep. Dan  
Burton, R-Ind., a member of the committee, despite letters to the 
chairman, Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., from Warren Christopher, 
then the secretary of state, and Anthony Lake, who headed the 
National Security Council, saying that Dobbins' answers were 
truthful. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department did not prosecute Dobbins, but Sally  
Light, who headed the personnel office at the State Department, 
decided he should be reprimanded. Her ruling was set aside in 
October 1988 by Janice F. Bay, a senior personnel officer, who had 
a ``letter of admonishment'' placed in Dobbins' file. 
</P>
<P>
	``We determined that he was careless, that he could have  
expressed himself better, but that he did not intentionally seek to 
mislead Congress, that he testified in good faith,'' James P. 
Foley, the deputy spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was a single answer to Burton, and Bay concluded it was  
``technically truthful'' but Dobbins should have ``more carefully 
considered'' his reply that the FBI had not briefed him about the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Bay said, Dobbins had not received detailed briefings  
but could have given Burton a more complete response. 
</P>
<P>
	Under State Department procedures, the letter was kept in  
Dobbins' personnel file for a year and then destroyed -- in effect, 
clearing his record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobbins testified in a period when the Clinton administration's  
policy on Haiti was under Republican attack. Dobbins, a longtime 
career diplomat who has served in Europe as an ambassador, defended 
the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, when Albright selected Dobbins to oversee U.S.  
policy in Bosnia and in Kosovo, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote Albright 
suggesting she pick someone ``who has not been accused by the State 
Department's inspector general of lying to Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Foley said Dobbins retained Albright's ``full  
confidence'' and that she would explain that to Helms. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman went on to describe Dobbins, 56, as ``one of the  
to-flight diplomats in the State Department'' with ``a really 
remarkable record of service to this country.''

<HEADLINE> Padres Catcher Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres starting catcher Carlos  
Hernandez will be out for the season after undergoing surgery to 
repair his ruptured left Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy said team trainer Todd Hutcheson told him  
the tendon was completely torn. The surgery was performed Thursday 
night by team doctors Jan Fronek and Steven Copp at Scripps Green 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to all go well,'' Bochy said.  
</P>
<P>
	One club official said it'll be six months before Hernandez, 31,  
will be able to do light jogging and squatting exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was injured after hitting a pop fly in San Diego's 7-6  
exhibition win against the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday in 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven seasons as a backup in Los Angeles and one in San  
Diego, Hernandez became the Padres' everyday catcher last year. He 
handled a staff that had the fourth-lowest ERA in the majors, and 
hit .262 with nine homers and 52 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez had several clutch hits in the regular season, then  
hit .325 in the postseason for the NL champion Padres. He led San 
Diego with a .417 average in the division series win against 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rewarded in December with a three-year, $6.5 million  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sad thing is, last year he really was able to shed  
that label of just being a backup catcher,'' general manger Kevin 
Towers said from Peoria, Ariz. ``He proved not only to us, but to 
the baseball world, that he's a solid, everyday catcher. It's tough 
when you lose your everyday catcher. He's more than just one of 
your nine. I mean, they're responsible for the success of your 
pitching staff, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres planned to carry three catchers this year, with Jim  
Leyritz and Greg Myers backing up Hernandez, the stronger defensive 
player of the three. Towers said the team will use the final two 
weeks of spring training to decide whether to carry two or three 
catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Top prospect Ben Davis, who had been slated to play at Class AAA  
Las Vegas, could get a shot, but Bochy said Thursday night that it 
might be best if Davis wasn't rushed to the big leagues. Also in 
camp is Mark Parent, 37, who was signed primarily to work with 
Davis in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to carry three,'' said Towers, who added that  
the Padres could go with two catchers and then carry an extra 
pitcher or outfielder. But Leyritz, who is Sterling Hitchcock's 
personal catcher, also backs up Wally Joyner at first base, and the 
Padres could leave themselves a little bare if they go with just 
two catchers.

<HEADLINE> Investigation at Crash Site Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Federal investigators began wrapping up  
their work at the site of a deadly train-truck accident Friday, and 
the question of when the truck driver entered the track crossing 
remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by National Transportation Safety Board  
investigator J.S. Dunn said ``a number of people'' claiming to have 
witnessed the crash that killed 11 had come forward and that their 
stories would be checked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any characterization of witness statements up to this point  
would be one person's interpretation and not the position of the 
Safety Board,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal sources told The Associated Press that the first witness  
to come forward said he saw the truck loaded with steel enter a 
railroad crossing despite flashing warning lights just before it 
was struck by an onrushing Amtrak passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the AP had reported that the witness had said that  
the truck driver tried to snake through lowered crossing gates and 
beat the train. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an NTSB source said language problems made it unclear  
if the Spanish-speaking witness said the crossing's gates were down 
at the time the truck entered. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson,  
said the engineer of the City of New Orleans train claimed the 
truck driver tried to zigzag his tractor-trailer through the 
crossing gates after they had come down. 
</P>
<P>
	NTSB member John Goglia said a full statement from the engineer  
will have to wait, since he is sedated and still shaken by the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	After days working to identify the remains, the Kankakee County  
coroner's office released a complete list of the dead Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-car train slammed into the truck loaded with steel rods  
at 79 mph in a rural crossing 50 miles south of Chicago on Monday. 
All of those killed in the fiery wreck were found in a sleeper car 
that was badly damaged by one of the engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucker John Stokes, 58, reportedly said he couldn't see the  
train coming and the gates were up when he entered the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Sacks, an attorney representing Stokes, told WGN-TV in  
Chicago that Stokes was ``very upset, very distressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's affected him. It will affect him forever,'' Sacks said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have confirmed a criminal investigation is under  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois secretary of state records show during the last 31  
years, Stokes had 13 driving-related convictions and was involved 
in nine accidents before Monday's train collision, spokeswoman Anne 
Dybek said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The records include five Indiana speeding tickets he received  
while driving a commercial vehicle. The earlier accident records do 
not indicate whether Stokes was at fault nor where the accidents 
occurred or whether he was driving a truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Stokes' convictions over the years was one in 1978 for  
disregarding a traffic control light and one for reckless driving 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Sacks said he did not know anything about Stokes' driving  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know that he was properly licensed, that they tested him  
for substances,'' Sacks said. ``Anything else to me isn't 
relevant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A brother and sister whose mother -- Marie Munson, 64 -- died in  
the crash visited the site Friday and urged the truck driver to say 
publicly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he ran the gates and they were down, I'd like for him to  
come out and admit it,'' Robert Munson said. ``If he did do it, 
have the common decency to admit it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiffany Munson said their mother was en route to New Orleans to  
visit relatives and originally bought a coach ticket, then upgraded 
it to a berth on the ill-fated sleeper car. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was scared to death of flying'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Investigation at Crash Site Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Tiffany and Robert Munson wanted the  
world to know how much they loved their mom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved her so much. She was my best friend,'' said Miss  
Munson, her voice choking with emotion as she and her brother stood 
in a field Friday, not far from where Marie Munson and 10 others 
died in the fiery crash of Amtrak's City of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kankakee County coroner finally was able to identify all of  
the victims and release a list of the dead Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Munson, 64, of Mount Prospect was traveling to visit  
relatives in New Orleans when the train slammed into a truck loaded 
with steel Monday night at a crossing in this community about 50 
miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mom loved to ride on trains,'' said Munson, 31. ``Ever  
since she was a little girl, that's what she loved to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She was scared to death of flying,'' added his 28-year-old  
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people were injured in the crash. Fifteen were  
still being treated at area hospitals, with one person in critical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators began wrapping up their work at the site  
of the accident Friday, and the question of when truck driver John 
Stokes pulled onto the tracks remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by National Transportation Safety Board  
investigator J.S. Dunn said ``a number of people'' claiming to have 
witnessed the crash had come forward and that their stories would 
be checked. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal sources told The Associated Press on Thursday that the  
first witness to come forward said he saw the truck enter the 
crossing despite flashing warning lights. 
</P>
<P>
	However, language problems made it unclear if the  
Spanish-speaking witness said the crossing gates were down at the 
time. NTSB investigators are waiting to formally interview the 
train's engineer, who is hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes, 58, reportedly said after the crash that he couldn't see  
the 14-car train coming and the gates were up when he entered the 
crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Sacks, an attorney representing Stokes, told WGN-TV in  
Chicago that Stokes was ``very distressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's affected him. It will affect him forever,'' Sacks said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past 31 years, Stokes had 13 driving-related convictions  
in Illinois and was involved in nine accidents before Monday, 
secretary of state spokeswoman Anne Dybek said. 
</P>
<P>
	The records include five Indiana speeding tickets he received  
while driving a commercial vehicle. Among Stokes' convictions was 
one in 1978 for disregarding a traffic light in Cook County and one 
for reckless driving in Kankakee County in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Mistake in Will Instigates Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- A single word apparently cost  
81-year-old lawyer John D. Goodin his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodin left out the word ``stock'' from a woman's will, and her  
ex-husband, Walter Shell, believed that omission cost him up to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, police say, an enraged Shell went to Goodin's law  
office and shot him to death along with an insurance agent who 
happened to be there at the time. Shell was charged with murder and 
jailed without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell, 71, was known as a strange character around his  
neighborhood, where he had two surveillance cameras around his 
modest home and was often seen muttering to himself. The shooting 
was not the first time he had confronted Goodin over the will. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd been in there a number of times, acting upset and  
belligerent,'' said Fred Lance, a lawyer who sometimes worked with 
Goodin. Goodin ``always tried to calm him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell and his ex-wife, Katie Roselle Shell, had been divorced  
about a decade but remained friendly. They lived close to each 
other, and he helped care for her after she was stricken with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days before Mrs. Shell died last November, Goodin visited  
her in the hospital and revised her will, removing Shell as 
executor and replacing him with a neighbor designated by Mrs. 
Shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shell apparently wanted a third party to handle her estate  
because of problems between her ex-husband and their two daughters, 
Lance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell and his daughters equally divided $12,000 from an  
insurance policy. Mrs. Shell also left him a car and lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised will also stipulated Shell was to receive ``all  
monies'' after the legal costs for the estate were paid. His 
daughters challenged the will, claiming that since the word 
``stock'' was not included, Shell was not entitled to any of the 
$100,000 in shares their mother owned. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge agreed and gave the stock to the daughters.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday afternoon, Shell got into his pickup and drove  
slowly down the street, smiling and waving at neighbor Ricky 
Clouse's son, who was playing basketball in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say that about an hour later, Shell walked into  
Goodin's office in nearby Johnson City and fired five shots. Goodin 
was shot in the head, and the insurance agent, Paul S. Keyser III, 
35, was shot in the chest. Shell later turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought he was a little bit on the looney side,''  
Clouse said. ``But as far as him doing anything like this, it's 
really hard to believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shell placed an electric fence around his yard after his ex-wife  
died. And though he lived in a modest, one-story brick home in a 
rural part of Jonesborough where most people don't lock their 
doors, he was extremely worried about being robbed, said Clouse, 
who lived near Shell for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell installed two surveillance cameras on his property and  
often walked around his yard muttering to himself, Clouse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell's daughters did not return calls for comment Friday.  
Police said they did not know whether Shell has a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodin was well-known in Johnson City. He opened his law firm  
here in 1939, was a judge from 1980 to 1985 and was a past 
president of the Washington County Bar Association. He specialized 
in probate cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyser, an agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., was  
in Goodin's office trying to sell him a policy.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pleas Guilty to N.J. Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A teen-ager accused of killing an  
11-year-old neighbor who came to his door selling merchandise for 
the PTA pleaded guilty today to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Manzie, 17, appeared calm as he described in court how he  
strangled Eddie Werner with a cord from an alarm clock, stuff his 
body into a suitcase and dragged it to a wooded area. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie faces 30 years to life in prison when he is sentenced  
April 14 on the murder charge. He was originally charged with 
murder, robbery and aggravated sexual assault in the Sept. 27, 
1997, slaying, which shocked Jackson Township and raised questions 
about the use of children for fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	In return for Manzie's plea, the other charges were dropped.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie was killed as he was out selling gift wrap and other  
holiday items for the PTA. Manzie lured him into his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie's mother, Valerie Werner, said earlier today she was  
satisfied with the plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, sitting in court and dredging up everything would  
be very difficult, hard for the kids, the family and his friends,'' 
she said. ``I'm just glad we won't have to go through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie had been scheduled to be tried as an adult beginning  
April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers had originally planned a ``diminished capacity''  
defense, in which they would argue Manzie, 15 at the time of the 
killing, had a mental defect that prevented him from forming the 
intent necessary to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing occurred three days after Manzie's parents sought  
unsuccessfully to have a judge commit the boy to an institution 
because of erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	During today's hearing, Manzie's father was almost ejected from  
the courtroom following an outburst as Superior Court Judge Peter 
Giovine was questioning the boy, who is taking an antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you ask him these questions when he's not on  
medication?'' said the father, Nicholas Manzie. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was involved with alleged pedophile Stephen P. Simmons,  
now 45, whom he met in an online chat room, the defense said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Simmons carried on a sexual relationship with  
the teen that included hotel room trysts and photographs of sex 
acts. Simmons, of Holbrook, N.Y., faces nine counts in the case, 
including sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie's lawyers had been expected to argue that he wasn't  
liable for his actions because of the mental defect related, in 
part, to his relationship with Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie, who was in sixth grade, was hoping to win a walkie-talkie  
set by selling the most items when he disappeared from his 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie allegedly killed the boy when he rejected Manzie's sexual  
advances. Afterward, he took a photograph of the boy's half-naked 
body, a necktie and an alarm clock cord still around his neck, 
according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	He then stuffed the 4-foot-11 inch, 60-pound body into a  
suitcase and dragged it into a wooded area, where it was found two 
days later, prosecutors said. Manzie was arrested within days.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Pioneer Dies at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wilbur L. Pritchard, a radio satellite  
pioneer, died Thursday in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., from 
lung cancer. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Pritchard in the 1950s helped develop a system for sending  
information via using microwave transmissions and helped develop 
the first microwave oven as an engineer for the Raytheon Corp.

	In the 1960s he directed a team that produced the nation's first  
operational military satellite system and assisted NATO with its 
satellite program. 
</P>
<P>
	An early advocate of using satellites in broadcasting, Pritchard  
joined the Communications Satellite Corp. in 1967 and established 
its Comsat Laboratories. In the 1970s he headed companies and 
consulting firms that designed communications satellites and worked 
in the area of cellular and mobile phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, he was producing telecommunications  
economic and technical studies as a consultant to private companies 
and governments, including Russia and Tonga. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Kathleen Moss Pritchard, two sons,  
one daughter, a brother and four grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Feds Probe Vehicle Gas Leaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
DaimlerChrysler's popular minivans and some General Motors pickups 
because of the possibility that side-impact crashes could cause gas 
tank leaks that would spark fires. 
</P>
<P>
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigators are  
looking into the fuel tank construction on minivans from model 
years 1996-1999, agency documents show. About 2 million of the 
minivans are on the road, the safety agency estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials also are investigating the tanks on some  
Chevrolet S-10 pickups to determine whether they may be punctured 
in side-impact crashes, leak fuel and cause fires. 
</P>
<P>
	During a federal crash test of a 1999 Dodge Caravan minivan, the  
hose that channels gasoline from the gas pump into the minivan's 
fuel tank pulled loose, and half the tank's fuel spilled out, an 
agency report said. The crash test simulates a vehicle crashing 
into the side of the minivan at 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency believes the same tank system is on the later model  
Town and Country minivans, the Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan 
minivans and the Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Sheila Gruber McLean said Friday  
that the company was ``carefully reviewing'' the Jan. 5 crash test 
and cooperating with federal investigators. She said the company 
had discovered no similar complaints of fuel leakage or fires 
attributed to hoses' coming loose in crashes on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Motors investigation involves the model year 1999  
S-10 pickups with four-cylinder engines, but agency officials said 
it could be expanded to other model years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency conducted a side-impact crash test on one of the  
pickups in November, and the fuel tank was pushed into the drive 
shaft. The drive shaft punctured the gas tank, leaking gasoline. 
The drive shaft is connected to the axle that turns the wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	After the test, GM introduced a production change that added a  
shield to the tank, according to agency documents. Trucks with 
six-cylinder engines already have shields. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither agency officials or the company had an immediate  
estimate of how many of the four-cylinder vehicles without the 
shield are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cooperating fully with the investigation,'' said GM  
spokesman Terry Rhadigan. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry  
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork 
including complaints, as in the DaimlerChrysler and GM cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation then could be upgraded to an engineering  
analysis, during which engineers study parts to see if they are 
defective. An investigation eventually can lead to a recall.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Alum Stockton Proud of Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Gonzaga's unlikely run in the NCAA  
tournament got some proud words of encouragement Friday night from 
John Stockton, the school's most famous basketball-playing alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton was part of a subdued Utah Jazz locker room after the  
team's 83-82 overtime loss to Charlotte, but he brightened up 
considerably when asked about Gonzaga's chances against Connecticut 
in Saturday's West Regional championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' Stockton said. ``They need to play  
well, but they know that. I just hope they have the best game of 
their careers right then and there and make it to the Final Four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born and raised in Spokane, Wash., Stockton not only went to  
high school and college in the city, but he still lives there in 
the offseason with his wife, Nada, and their three children. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton became Gonzaga's first player with 1,000 points and 500  
assists, and as a senior in 1984 he was the most valuable player of 
the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's career leader in assists and steals, Stockton  
maintains close ties to the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they come back to school in the fall, they're kind enough  
to let me play in pickup games, and that helps me try to get in 
shape for the season,'' he said. ``They've been doing that for my 
entire career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's game against the Wizards on Thursday night in Washington  
started at about the same time as Gonzaga's regional semifinal 
against Florida. But after the Jazz put the finishing touches on a 
95-87 victory over the Wizards, Stockton rushed back to the locker 
room to see if he could catch his alma mater on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the last 30 seconds of the game. We came back in the  
locker room and flipped the television on,'' he said. ``It was 
really exciting. It was nice to have it turn out that way for guys 
you really like to root for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he missed most of Gonzaga's 73-72 victory over  
Florida, Stockton plans to make up for it Saturday. The Jazz will 
already be in Detroit for Sunday's game against the Pistons, and 
Stockton plans to plant himself in front of a television set to 
watch the regional championship game against Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a fun group to root for. They're really good guys,''  
he said. ``You know that they'll work hard, you know that they'll 
go out there and mix it up and then you add some talent on top of 
it, and anything can happen. I wish them all the best.''

<HEADLINE> Mortality of Black Infants Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Racism, discrimination and other stresses  
black women encounter could be a factor in their babies facing a 
higher risk of infant death than white children, speakers at a 
conference on black infant mortality said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, about seven infants of every 1,000 born die before  
reaching age 1. But black infants are 2 1/2 times more likely than 
white infants to die before their first birthday, Surgeon General 
David Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have a situation where an African-American baby  
is 2 1/2 times more likely to die, it reflects a major problem in 
society,'' Satcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Premature birth and low birth weight are significant factors in  
infant mortality, and researchers said stress from environmental 
and social conditions could be leading to black women giving birth 
earlier and to smaller children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Racism ... needs to be studied if we want to understand health  
differences between blacks and whites,'' said Dr. Richard David, 
associate professor in the College of Medicine at the University of 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have these disparities,'' said Dr. Diane Rowley with  
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ``The only question 
is, are we willing to do what it's going to take to not lose these 
children?'' 
</P>
<P>
	David said preliminary research seems to show factors like  
environmental toxins, living in high-violence areas, feeling 
discriminated against at work or at school can all go toward 
children being born with low birth weights. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowley said the medical world needs to focus more on how to  
determine the impact of stress on the body, but that it was 
difficult to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference was organized by the Northern New Jersey Maternal  
Child Health Consortium, which came out with a report in September 
1997 that said stress most likely factored into black infant 
mortality.

<HEADLINE> Capital Cleans Up for NATO Bash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's capital, preparing for  
head-of-state gridlock at April's NATO summit, is cleaning streets, 
hauling off tons of trash and scrubbing away graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
	The new mayor, Anthony Williams, said Friday he wants to use the  
50th anniversary summit of up to 44 world leaders, Washington's 
largest such gathering since the military alliance was signed into 
being in 1949, to showcase the city that has a less than shiny 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking to clean our city and ... put us on the map as a  
great international capital,'' Williams said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor, in office since January, said the District of  
Columbia is concentrating cleanup efforts on main traffic 
corridors, over which motorcades of limousines, vans and cars will 
carry foreign leaders, and on a Federal Triangle complex where 
delegates will meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the principal entryways into the 68-square-mile home of  
the federal government pass through neighborhoods where crime rates 
and drug use have been historically high and years worth of 
graffiti scar buildings and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
	New trees are being planted, street lights are being fixed, even  
the rats are under all-out assault from public works crews as part 
of a city beautification program that's getting a NATO summit 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to allow us to do something important for our city  
as well, and that is to showcase our city,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor since January, Harvard-educated Williams replaced Marion  
Barry, who won a fourth term despite a 1991 conviction and jail 
sentence on a misdemeanor drug charge of smoking crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams faces the challenge of trying to turn around the rough  
reputation of a city once known as the murder capital of the nation 
for its homicide rate that peaked in 1991 at 482. The rate dropped 
to 261 murders in 1998, but police say it is on the rise again this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to observing NATO's 50th anniversary, the summit  
also is to celebrate the induction of three new members into the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization: Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. They bring the alliance's membership to 19. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton invited NATO leaders to Washington to  
commemorate President Truman's signing of alliance formation 
documents as well as to consider NATO's role in a post-Cold War 
world where the nemesis it was formed to defeat, the Soviet Union, 
no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 23-25 summit will include a meeting of leaders of the  
19 member states and the North Atlantic Council, the governing body 
of NATO. The 44-member Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, which 
includes NATO states and 25 countries in the affiliated Partnership 
for Peace, also will meet. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, nearly 1,800 delegates and up to 4,000 members of the  
media will descend on Washington. The leaders and their immediate 
entourages alone will occupy more than 1,600 hotel rooms, 
organizers said. About 500 extra vans and cars have been hired to 
help with transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	Security will be tight. The Secret Service, which protects the  
president and visiting world leaders, takes the lead role with help 
of the local police, the FBI, the Pentagon and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Dowling, head of the Secret Service field office in  
Washington, said the government is used to protecting large groups 
of leaders and diplomats, such as at the annual opening of the 
United Nations General Assembly in New York and at presidential 
inaugurations. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about potential terrorist threats, Dowling said,  
``Certainly any event of this magnitude is a prime opportunity. ... 
We do make plans in the event that would happen, and we certainly 
hope that it wouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Blinken, chairman of the host committee and former U.S.  
ambassador to Belgium, said event planners hope to raise $8 million 
from private companies to refurbish buildings where summit events 
will be or where delegates will stay outside of hotels.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Buekeboom Ends Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom,  
sidelined since early February with a concussion, said Friday he 
will sit out the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Buekeboom said at a news conference that he  
hoped to return for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's serious enough to realize that I might never play this  
game again,'' Buekeboom said at Madison Square Garden before the 
Rangers' game against Buffalo, ``but I feel in my heart that I 
probably will play again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom said the injury felt like ``a dull toothache.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Federal Phone Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court upheld a Federal  
Communications Commission decision Friday that was designed to spur 
local telephone competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  
Columbia affirmed FCC orders, dating from 1993, that determined how 
much the nation's Bell companies, GTE and other major local phone 
providers may charge other companies for renting space inside their 
central offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that compete or want to compete against the major  
local phone companies need to install equipment in those offices in 
order to provide their own phone or other communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the FCC did not engage in arbitrary or  
capricious decision making,'' the court ruled. The case attacked, 
among other things, the FCC's rate-setting methodology. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of local phone companies led by Southwestern Bell  
Telephone Co. brought the case to court. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision came a day after the FCC tightened rules to  
make it easier for competing companies to install equipment at 
major local companies' central offices.

<HEADLINE> Navy Asked To Change Pilot's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two senators asked Navy Secretary Richard  
Danzig on Friday to change the Pentagon's official ``finding of 
death'' for a Navy pilot shot down in the opening hours of the 1991 
Gulf War to ``missing in action,'' reflecting evidence of doubt 
about whether he survived the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Cmdr. Michael Speicher of Jacksonville, Fla., went missing  
when his Navy F-18 Hornet was shot down on Jan. 16, 1991, in an 
air-to-air battle with an Iraqi fighter jet. He was the first 
American lost in the war and the last still unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the justification for the finding of death  
determination in May 1991 is no longer valid and conclusive,'' 
Sens. Bob Smith, R-N.H., and Rod Grams, R-Minn., wrote in the 
letter to the Navy's top civilian leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The late Adm. Mike Boorda, then the chief of naval operations,  
approved the official ``finding of death'' on May 22, 1991. That 
action changed his official status from missing in action to killed 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1998, following efforts by Smith and Grams to learn  
more about what the U.S. intelligence agencies knew of Speicher' 
fate, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was given a 
classified chronology of the intelligence agencies' activities on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly believe that the information contained therein  
supports the request we are making of you with this letter,'' Smith 
and Grams told Danzig. They did not cite any specific evidence, 
which is classified secret. 
</P>
<P>
	The senators said they were informed on March 12 by the Defense  
Department's POW-Missing Personnel Office that its position on 
whether the available evidence indicates Speicher perished in the 
crash of his plane is ``we don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In light of that, Speicher's status should be changed to missing  
in action -- ``a status that more accurately reflects the available 
evidence and provides a presumptive `benefit of the doubt' to Lt. 
Cmdr. Speicher,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe nothing less to Lt. Cmdr. Speicher and his family,''  
the senators wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Craig Quigley, spokesman for Danzig, said Friday evening  
he was not sure whether Danzig had seen the letter yet but that the 
Navy chief would act as quickly as possible to address the 
senators' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Grams have said before that Pentagon officials  
initially told them there was no evidence to indicate that Speicher 
could have survived the crash. However, in May 1994 -- more than 
three years after Speicher went missing -- Pentagon officials 
indicated in a secret memorandum that a U.S. spy satellite had 
photographed a ``manmade symbol'' at the crash site earlier that 
year. Some military officers said they interpreted the symbol as a 
sign that the Navy pilot might have survived the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Speicher was the only American killed on Iraqi territory whose  
remains were not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	A plan was devised in 1994 to conduct a covert operation into  
Iraq to search the crash site for clues to Speicher's fate, but it 
was scrapped in December 1994 by Army Gen. John Shalikashvili, then 
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The general ruled that 
the risk of casualties was too high to justify the secret mission. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, U.S. crash site specialists from the Defense  
Department, working with the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, entered Iraq with President Saddam Hussein's permission. 
When they got to the crash site they found it had been excavated, 
The New York Times reported in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Injured in Darlington Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Bobby Labonte, second in the Winston Cup  
points race, broke his right shoulder in practice today at 
Darlington Raceway, and his status for the TranSouth 400 was 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was taken to the Carolinas Hospital System facility in  
Florence. Track spokesman Russell Branham said the 34-year-old 
Texan was expected to be released later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Branham said the injury was at the tip of the scapula, that  
Labonte was initially in pain but later joked with nurses at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte was hurt in the Busch series car he also drives for Joe  
Gibbs Racing. The Pontiac Labonte was to drive Sunday in the 
TranSouth 400 was practiced by Busch regular Matt Kenseth, who also 
planned to qualify the car this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth's availability for the race Sunday had not been  
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Gibbs withdrew the Busch car Labonte was practicing and would  
have used Saturday to defend his title in the Diamond Hill 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Also crashing during practice on the 1.366-mile oval was Jimmy  
Spencer. His car caught on fire and was badly singed when it was 
towed back to Winston Cup garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Spencer, 29th in the points raced, rode back in the cab of a  
truck, and did not appear to be injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett, winner of the past two TranSouth 400s, can't help  
sneaking a look at Jeff Gordon and Jeff Burton when it comes to 
races at Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett can tie David Pearson, the track's career champion with  
10 Winston Cup victories, by winning the TranSouth for the third 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it seems like everyone, including Jarrett, talks about the  
battle of Jeffs that's gone on here the past few years. Gordon has 
won five of the past seven races, including an unprecedented four 
straight Southern 500s, while Burton has four top-five finishes the 
past two years and nearly ended Gordon's string in the past two 
Labor Day races. 
</P>
<P>
	In their straightaway duel at the 1997 Southern 500 over the  
final half-mile, Gordon blocked out a hard-charging Burton, who 
ducked down low in one of NASCAR's most classic recent finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, Gordon and Burton all shoot for this year's TranSouth  
400 title, with qualifying today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon's won twice this year, most recently last week at  
Atlanta. Burton edged out his brother Ward to win at Las Vegas two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's pretty sure he knows who he'll have to outrace to  
match the record of ``The Silver Fox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two guys that run as well there as what we do, and  
that's Jeff Burton and Jeff Gordon, and we'll have to race them,'' 
Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett did just that at Darlington a year ago, beating Gordon  
to the finish line by about three car lengths after the two touched 
coming out of the last turn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Jarrett's Ford held off Ted Musgrave in a similar  
situation to win for the first time at a track only 40 minutes from 
where he grew up in Camden. 
</P>
<P>
	Can Jarrett keep things going this year?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we can, but it's a tough race track as always,''  
Jarrett said. ``It's not like it's getting any easier and with each 
race, it just becomes a little more difficult with the pavement 
wearing out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the only driver besides the Jeffs to win a Winston  
Cup event this year, has watched from the back of the pack as 
Gordon, Burton and Jarrett have become dominant at Darlington. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin used to hold that position, taking five races here  
between 1993-96, including the Southern 500 six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's so eager to run well at Darlington, he spent time  
testing the week after he won at Rockingham. His top lap of 169.698 
mph was more than a mile per hour quicker than his pole-winning lap 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of success here, but in the last few years,  
it's been pretty lean,'' he said. ``We're ready to get back in a 
racy mode here and be a contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett has learned to glide through the 1.366-mile oval layout  
with the grace of Pearson, who won a record seven spring races at 
the track that now has a grandstand named for him. 
</P>
<P>
	As a child, Jarrett would follow Pearson's Hall-of-Fame career  
and dream of similar feats. ``The things that he's been able to 
accomplish in this sport just amazes me,'' Jarrett said of Pearson. 
``Maybe we can do that, but it'll be tough.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Opponents See Chances Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Anti-smoking activists say they're determined  
to continue the fight against Big Tobacco despite the industry's 
victory in fending off a $2 billion lawsuit accusing them of 
targeting blue-collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury on Thursday rejected the complaint of 114 Ohio  
union health funds that cigarette makers hid the dangers of smoking 
since 1954 and used ad gimmicks such as Joe Camel and the Marlboro 
Man to target union members. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first of at least 14 such lawsuits in the nation to  
go to trial. A similar trial is expected in Seattle in September, 
and another in New York early next year. However, several other 
cases have been thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think it's a very viable lawsuit,'' Patrick Coughlin,  
the Ohio unions' lead attorney, said Friday. ``I don't think one 
loss here says that's the way it will go necessarily. ... We need 
to try more in other jurisdictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Robert Weber, a Cleveland lawyer who represented R.J.  
Reynolds, said the precedent set in the union case, plus appellate 
rulings expected in similar cases over the next two months, were 
sure to have an effect on subsequent cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the one they made the centerpiece of their attack.  
This was the one they fought to keep on track,'' Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Thursday, the industry could justifiably feel under siege.  
States are deciding how to handle $246 billion in settlements; 
President Clinton recently suggested a lawsuit against tobacco 
companies to recover smoking-related Medicare expenses; and a 
former smoker in San Francisco last month won a $51.5 million 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Daynard, chairman of Tobacco Products Liability Project,  
an anti-tobacco group in Boston, called the Ohio verdict ``sort of 
a nasty bump in the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You say, 'Oops. What was that?' But you keep driving forward.  
No one who looks at these cases ever believed the plaintiffs would 
win all of them,'' he said. Daynard, a professor at Northeastern 
School of Law, said it is too early to know whether the verdict 
will hurt other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Spievack, a New York lawyer who specializes in mass product  
liability claims and insurance coverage but was not connected with 
the Ohio case, said the verdict could mean future tobacco lawsuits 
are more likely to come from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tobacco industry's argument is that basically everybody  
knew the risk,'' he said. ``If you have an individual plaintiff 
with cancer, that might be easier (to prove) than if there is no 
clear plaintiff.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan Nears Decision on Renault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. moved closer Friday to a deal  
meant to ensure its survival by surrendering some control to a 
foreign company in exchange for an infusion of badly needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
	So embarrassed is Japan's No. 2 automaker about having to turn  
to France's Renault SA for help that chairman Yoshifumi Tsuji has 
decided to resign to take responsibility, Japanese news reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan spokesman Masataka Saito refused to comment on the  
reports. But Nissan did say that its board will make a decision on 
March 27 about Renault's bid to buy a 35 percent stake in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``A potential business tie-up with Renault will give Nissan  
significant benefits and synergies in many areas,'' Nissan's 
president, Yoshikazu Hanawa, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese news reports said Nissan's board will almost certainly  
vote to accept the offer, valued by analysts at about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign automakers have bought stakes in other Japanese car  
makers, but not in the largest ones such as Nissan. Ford Motor owns 
a controlling minority stake in Mazda Motor, and General Motors 
recently increased its stake in Isuzu Motors to 49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The past year has seen a series of major cross-border  
consolidations in the auto industry. Ford announced in January it 
was buying the passenger car operations of Volvo AB, Daimler-Benz 
AG bought Chrysler Corp. last year, and General Motors Corp. is in 
talks with Saab Automobile AB to buy the 50 percent of Saab that it 
doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan ranks seventh in the world in production of cars and  
trucks and Renault is No. 11, according to Ward's Automotive 
International, an industry newsletter. If the two merged -- which is 
not being proposed -- the combined business would rank fourth in 
terms of production and fifth in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has been seeking a foreign investor to help it return to  
profitability. The carmaker has lost money in five of the last six 
years, and it forecasts losing another $250 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan got into trouble by trying to compete with stronger rival  
Toyota Motor Corp. head-to-head in almost every segment of Japan's 
auto market. It now appears likely that Nissan will cut the number 
of model types it makes from its current 25 to as few as five and 
focus more on products that can earn money. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance would give Renault a premier distribution system in  
Asia as well as access to Nissan's superior technology in engines, 
suspension, batteries and fuel cells. Nissan would, in turn, get a 
desperately needed cash infusion, better European distribution and 
management talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's board met Friday to discuss Renault's offer but decided  
to postpone the vote as lawyers were still trying to work out 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	After a deal is struck, Nissan's chairman will offer his  
resignation at the company's next shareholder meeting in late June, 
Japan's state-run NHK television and the Kyodo News agency 
reported. Tsuji, 71, will step down out of contrition for putting 
Nissan in the position of surrendering management autonomy to a 
foreign company, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of Renault's bid, the French carmaker would  
install one of its own executives in Nissan's No. 2 management 
spot. Renault employees would also fill another one or two seats on 
Nissan's board.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Torre Has Cancer Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre will spend a  
few days recuperating in a St. Louis hospital after surgeons 
successfully removed his cancerous prostate gland. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgeon who removed the gland, Dr. William Catalona, said  
Torre's prognosis is excellent, and the doctor believes the disease 
has not spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very routine,'' Catalona said Thursday. ``I think he  
had a very early prostate cancer and it went very smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lab tests on the removed gland and surrounding lymph nodes won't  
be complete for a few days, but Catalona said, ``The way it looked 
to the naked eye, the prognosis is excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona, a pioneer in the detection and treatment of prostate  
cancer, said Torre's cancer was so small he couldn't see it even as 
he held the removed gland in his hand. It was diagnosed by the 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test that Catalona developed a 
decade ago, and confirmed by a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in  
American men and the second deadliest behind lung cancer. The 
walnut-sized gland is at the base of the bladder in men. Men 50 and 
older are most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In cases where cancer is confined to a removed prostate, the  
patient's prognosis is essentially as good as for a man who never 
had the disease, Catalona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, 58, underwent the 2 1/2-hour surgery at Barnes-Jewish  
Hospital, where he was expected to remain for 3-4 days. Torre will 
then recuperate in Florida, said Jeff Wehling, a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona pioneered a surgical technique known as nerve-sparing  
radical prostatectomy, which he used on Torre. The procedure 
generally results in fewer problems, including impotence, than 
conventional prostate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said there appeared to be very little damage to the  
nerves surrounding Torre's prostate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's wife, Ali, was ``ecstatic'' after learning about the  
successful surgery, Wehling said. She then called family members 
and acquaintances, including Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona said Torre seemed at ease prior the surgery, talking  
baseball and joking with doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very upbeat, cracking a lot of jokes -- he was really  
very amusing,'' Catalona said. ``I can see now why everybody likes 
him so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes-Jewish spokeswoman Kathryn Holleman said the hospital has  
received hundreds of calls from well-wishers. Wehling said Torre 
has also received numerous flowers and cards, many from St. 
Louisans who watched Torre when he played for, and later managed, 
the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's found greater success in New York, but the people in St.  
Louis still have incredibly fond memories,'' Wehling said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no timetable for Torre's return to the World Series  
champions, but Catalona said his patients typically go back to work 
6-12 weeks after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to encourage him not to go back too soon,'' Catalona  
said. ``He's got a very stressful job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was a four-time All-Star for the Cardinals, for whom he  
played from 1969 to 1974. He was the National League's Most 
Valuable Player award winner in 1971, when he hit .363 with 137 
runs batted in, both tops in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre managed the Cardinals from 1990, when he replaced Whitey  
Herzog, until he was fired in 1995. He earlier managed the Atlanta 
Braves and New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalona was recommended to Torre by former Yankees general  
manager Bob Watson, and by Cardinals Hall-of-Famer Stan Musial, 
hospital officials said. Catalona performed prostate cancer surgery 
on both men. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's cancer was diagnosed early because of an annual PSA  
exam, Catalona said. The problem was found during a checkup at the 
Yankees' spring training camp in Tampa, Fla., and announced last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're dealing with a tumor that doesn't let its presence be  
learned unless you're looking for it,'' Catalona said.

<HEADLINE> Low-Income Tax Credit Seems Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A credit that cuts taxes for low-income  
working people goes unnoticed by up to 4 million taxpayers who may 
qualify -- and millions of those who do claim the earned income tax 
credit make mistakes because of its daunting complexity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these errors may be due to intentionally excessive  
claims, but the complexity of the rules ... produces large numbers 
of mistakes even for people trying to get it right,'' Yale Law 
School professor Michael Graetz wrote in his recent book ``The 
Decline (and Fall?) of the Income Tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simply determining eligibility for the credit requires  
completion of a 12-question checklist, which is followed by a 
nine-line worksheet and an eight-line form. All of this requires 
reference to several pages of Internal Revenue Service 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS, which expects 20 million taxpayers to claim the credit  
this year, frequently finds up to 40 percent of such returns 
contain some error. But the people for whom the credit is intended 
typically don't have the money to hire a tax professional. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, people make careless errors or they just  
don't understand the law,'' said Candice Cromling, director of the 
IRS program on the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	The earned income tax credit was created in 1975, in part to  
keep lower-income people working to contribute payroll taxes to 
Social Security and Medicare and in part to give people incentives 
to stay off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on how many children a taxpayer has, people earning  
generally between $10,030 and $30,095 could be eligible this year. 
The income levels change each year according to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum credit is $3,756, and it is refundable, which means  
it can trigger a refund even for people who don't owe any income 
taxes. Last year, IRS processed $29 billion in such claims 
resulting in $23 billion in refunds. Most of the rest resulted in a 
lower tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Treasury Department estimates 20 percent of people who  
are eligible never attempt to put in a claim. ``A lot of people 
don't know about it,'' said Mildred Carter, senior tax analyst at 
CCH Inc., an Illinois-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has begun a campaign to raise people's awareness of the  
credit, including inserts in envelopes containing W-2 forms, ``EITC 
Days'' at community centers and volunteers with churches and 
charities who help people with their taxes in working-class 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS is also trying to reduce the error rate. Agents screen  
thousands of returns that claim the credit to check for mistakes as 
simple as an incorrect Social Security number or faulty math. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IRS also reviewed 290,000 suspect returns in 1998 that  
claimed earned income credits worth $662 million. Of those 
``flagged'' returns, the agency found 68 percent were invalid, 
according to the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS this year is preventing taxpayers who improperly claimed  
the credit from attempting to do so again, unless they fill out a 
new form explaining why they are eligible. For more serious 
offenders, the IRS can bar the credit for up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	There are ways to get help: IRS offices have Publication 596,  
which explains the law and eligibility rules. Agents at many of 
those offices can answer questions, or taxpayers can call the 
agency toll-free at 1-800-829-1040, seven days a week, 24 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS rules say some taxpayers earning as much as $14,200 and as  
little as $6,950 a year may not be required to file an income tax 
return, depending on age, marital status and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cromling said it's worth the effort: The average refund for  
taxpayers claiming the earned income credit is running at just over 
$2,000 this year. That compares with a national average refund of 
about $1,600.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Could Get Released Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson could be released from jail as  
early as March 26 if his lawyer's proposal is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Thursday that Judge Stephen Johnson  
of Montgomery County (Md.) Court told the former heavyweight 
champion's attorneys and the prosecutor he would rule March 26 on a 
request to reduce Tyson's one-year sentence for assault to eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	If Tyson's sentence were cut to eight months, the 50 days that  
he will have served in the Montgomery jail by next week would make 
him eligible immediately for a work-release program, to be followed 
by home detention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported, however, that a top corrections official said  
if Tyson is released he probably would be placed in home detention 
immediately because other inmates' activities would be disrupted by 
what he described as the media frenzy.

<HEADLINE> Judge Affirms Hoffa Union Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- James P. Hoffa promises to guide the Teamsters  
``back to greatness,'' after a federal judge affirmed his victory 
to head the union once led by his father. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein in New York  
affirmed Hoffa's victory in a December rerun presidential election 
and the decision of a federal overseer that certification of the 
election results should not be delayed because of charges pending 
against some members of the Hoffa slate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa, son of legendary Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa, defeated  
Tom Leedham in the December contest after a campaign finance 
scandal overturned president Ron Carey's 1996 re-election and 
barred Carey from trying to reclaim the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ... look forward to the opportunity, at long last, to lead  
the Teamsters union back to greatness,'' Hoffa said in a statement 
Friday night. ``A reunited, financially sound, corruption-free 
Teamsters will now take its place in the family of labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Election officer Michael Cherkasky certified the results of  
Hoffa's victory in January but barred one of Hoffa's running mates 
from taking office and delayed certifying the election results for 
two vice presidential posts representing Canadian locals. 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham had argued that the election results should not be  
certified until investigations of other candidates on Hoffa's slate 
had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelstein affirmed Election Appeals Master Kenneth Conboy's  
conclusion ``that certain allegations and charges regarding members 
of the Hoffa slate pending before the Independent Review Board did 
not justify a delay in the certification of the results of the 
(Teamsters) rerun election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leedham had also argued that Cherkasky was obligated to ``look  
to the character of the candidate, as well as to whether the 
candidate's misconduct irremediably tainted the election process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Justice Department, which has investigated the  
Teamsters for years amid charges of corruption and mob influence, 
challenged Leedham's characterization of Cherkasky's role. 
</P>
<P>
	The office of New York U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White told  
Edelstein in a letter that Cherkasky's job under a consent decree 
between the union and the Justice Department ``is to ensure a fair, 
honest and open election process, not to pass judgment on a 
candidate's character or fitness for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed, upholding the certification of the election  
results by the election officer and appeals master. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelstein also affirmed Cherkasky's decision to disqualify J.D.  
Potter from holding office as Teamsters southern region vice 
president. The judge directed Cherkasky to submit plans by April 1 
for a rerun election to fill the vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Review Board had accused Potter, the leader of a  
Texas local, of lying to election officers about exceeding campaign 
donation limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the Teamsters Canada vice presidential contest  
have not been certified. Cherkasky refused to certify the results 
while he investigated charges of voter fraud.

<HEADLINE> Gun Industry Fears Litigation Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Big city mayors who have sued the  
firearms industry insist their goal is to make the weapons safer. 
Still, few would be bothered if the litigation and publicity means 
fewer dollars for gun makers. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim puts it: ``If money is what  
wakes them up, then so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans last fall became the first city to sue the gun  
industry, seeking millions of dollars to cover police, hospital and 
other costs of responding to shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Chicago, Miami/Dade County and Bridgeport have since  
filed similar lawsuits. Officials in Newark, N.J., voted this week 
to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not file the lawsuits to have a negative impact on a  
gun company's stock prices,'' said Dennis Henigan, legal director 
of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, which is representing 
New Orleans, Miami-Dade County and Bridgeport in their lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We filed the lawsuits to change the way the gun industry does  
business,'' he said, ``and if it takes a decline in the company's 
stock price for it to get the message that its decisions have cost 
people's lives, then so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock price at one major U.S. gun maker, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.  
Inc. of Fairfield, has dropped from about $21 per share to as low 
as $8 in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Conder, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, blamed some  
of the stock's plunge on investors' fear of potential company 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's affected the stock price, that's for sure,'' Conder said.  
</P>
<P>
	Company officials did not return calls seeking comment this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Sanetti, vice president and general counsel, has  
vehemently defended the company's record on safety initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all due respect, we did not need to be sued by you in  
order to fully meet our safety responsibilities. They are our 
guiding principles every day,'' Sanetti said in a letter sent 
Thursday to Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Powers, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association,  
said the group believes a goal of the lawsuits is to cripple gun 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result of these suits, if successful to any degree, will  
be that these lawful businesses will be driven out of business or 
firearms will become so costly that most Americans will be unable 
to exercise that freedom,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Peace Talks Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Accusing the Serbs of trying to ``unravel'' a  
Kosovo peace deal, frustrated international mediators adjourned the 
Kosovo talks today and said they won't be resumed unless the Serbs 
decide to accept the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO airstrikes looming to force the Serb-led Yugoslav  
government to agree to a peace deal, evacuations began for peace 
monitors in Kosovo and Western diplomats in the Yugoslav capital, 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no purpose in extending the talks any further,'' said  
a statement issued by the French and British foreign ministers, who 
sponsored the talks. ``The negotiations are adjourned. The talks 
will not resume unless the Serbs express their acceptance of the 
accords.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British and French officials gave no timetable for possible NATO  
airstrikes, but diplomats have said attacks would be unlikely as 
long as the 1,400 unarmed monitors were in Kosovo. The verifiers 
for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were 
expected to be out of the province by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' Sen. Joe  
Biden told reporters at the White House after a hastily called 
morning meeting with President Clinton and top-ranking members of 
the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden said Clinton outlined a ``precise and rational plan'' that  
explained why the United States would have to join a NATO attack if 
the Serbs don't agree to a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's top commander in Europe gave no indication today when any  
airstrikes would begin. But Gen. Wesley Clark warned that the 
attacks would not be a ``one or two bomb affair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the past year in  
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is the dominant of two 
remaining republics comprising Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of 
Kosovo's 2.2 million people are ethnic Albanians, and most favor 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement by Britain's Robin Cook and France's Hubert  
Vedrine came the day after the ethnic Albanians signed the peace 
deal unilaterally. It included yet another stern threat to Yugoslav 
leader Slobodan Milosevic, who opposes a proposed NATO-led force in 
Kosovo to enforce a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We solemnly warn the authorities in Belgrade against any  
military offensive on the ground and any impediment of the freedom 
of movement of actions of the Kosovo verification mission,'' it 
said. ``Such violations would have the greatest consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, in a reference to threatened NATO airstrikes against  
Serbia, it said: ``We will immediately engage in consultations with 
our partners and allies to be ready to act. We will be in contact 
with the secretary-general of NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he expected such attacks, Vedrine told French  
radio: ``If we began the process of consultation this morning, it 
is because we are indeed at that stage of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's supreme commander in Europe, U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, told  
CNN International that while troops in neighboring Macedonia were 
on alert, Milosevic has guaranteed the monitors' safety ``and we're 
going to hold him to those guarantees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiator Christopher Hill underscored who, in NATO's  
view, is responsible for the imperiled peace deal, saying the Serbs 
``had not shown us in these discussions any glimmer of hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been here for five days now and their position today is  
the same as it was at the start of the talks,'' he told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Western diplomats said it was likely that a high-level European  
delegation -- possibly Vedrine and Cook -- would travel to Belgrade 
in coming days to see Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	In their joint statement, Cook and Vedrine praised the ethnic  
Albanians for ``seizing the opportunity'' of the Rambouillet talks 
and accused the Yugoslav delegation of trying to ``unravel'' the 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction to the French-British statement  
from Serb delegates, who left the site of the talks near the Arc de 
Triomphe without speaking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians, meanwhile, were already dispersing -- some members  
going to Brussels to meet NATO commanders, some to Washington and 
others returning to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The second round of Kosovo talks began Monday in Paris. They  
essentially ended Thursday night when the ethnic Albanian 
delegation signed the accord giving Kosovo's ethnic Albanians broad 
autonomy for a three-year interim period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have signed an agreement to bring peace to Kosovo,'' said  
the top ethnic Albanian delegate, Hashim Thaci. ``We hope that the 
force of the international community will make Yugoslavia sign. We 
say: The violence must stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav forces appeared to be mobilizing for all-out war in  
Kosovo, despite the renewed threats of NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, a spokesman for the province's leading ethnic  
Albanian moderate politician, Ibrahim Rugova, said NATO should 
immediately send in forces to protect the civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
	An OSCE spokesman, Jorgen Grunnet, said there were no reports of  
fighting in the rebellious province, where a steady snowfall made 
movement on the ground difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the situation is certainly tense,'' Grunnet said.  
</P>
<P>
	About 25 vehicles rolled out of a U.S. Embassy compound today  
carrying American diplomats and their families to neighboring 
Hungary. Canada, Britain, Germany and others said they would 
evacuate ``non-essential staff'' and dependents over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With the start of the season just more than two weeks away,  
those annoying spring training injuries that won't go away are 
getting troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra said Friday that he  
has had ``sharp pain'' in his arm and has been unable to throw a 
baseball for the past nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, runner-up in the AL MVP race last year, injured a  
tendon in his right biceps last Thursday against Toronto. He has 
been limited to designated hitter duty since then with what the Red 
Sox called tendinitis in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to a player of his caliber we tend to be  
cautious on how we handle these things,'' manager Jimy Williams 
said from Fort Myers, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes to a Boston camp that is still dealing with  
injuries to second baseman Jeff Frye, first baseman Reggie 
Jefferson and outfielder Midre Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Fla., New York Mets outfielder Bobby Bonilla  
will miss at least 10-14 days with a partial tear in the posterior 
cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worse now than what I thought when I came to the park,''  
Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``But it's better than I thought 
after I heard he (Bonilla) was going to get the MRI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla injured his right knee in a collision while running the  
bases against the Montreal Expos on March 8. He reaggravated the 
injury Thursday. The Mets said it was unsure if he would be healthy 
by opening day April 5 against Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten days isn't bad, more than 10 is probably too much, seven  
days is good,'' Valentine said. ``We're not looking at the calendar 
as to when he's coming back, we'll just let doctors and nature take 
its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Sarasota, Fla., Reds GM Jim Bowden said ace Denny Neagle will  
likely start the season on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acquired Denny Neagle to win 15 to 20 games and pitch 200  
innings. We need to make sure that his arm is built up and strong 
enough to be able to accomplish that,'' Reds general manager Jim 
Bowden said. ``So there's no point in our rushing when the season 
starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Louis, Cardinals right-hander Matt Morris has a sprained  
elbow on his throwing arm, and team officials aren't sure if he'll 
be ready for the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Though more tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis, team  
physician George Paletta said Friday the exam revealed the sprain, 
along with strain on the muscle around the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 24, is being counted on as the Cardinals' top pitcher  
this season. In two major league seasons, Morris is 19-14 with a 
2.97 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:  
</P>
<P>
                       *Yankees 11, Devil Rays 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At St. Petersburg, Fla., Scott Brosius hit a three-run homer and  
Shane Spencer knocked in three runs. Orlando Hernandez allowed four 
runs -- three earned -- and seven hits over 4 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Cardinals 11, Marlins 7    	
</P>
<P>
	At Viera, Fla., Mark McGwire didn't play Friday, but J.D. Drew  
and Eric Davis made up for it, hitting two of St. Louis' four home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Tigers 6, Blue Jays 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Lakeland, Fla., Detroit got homers from Damion Easley and  
Karim Garcia and Japanese right-hander Masao Kida earned his first 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Braves 6, Astros 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Kissimmee, Fla., Ryan Klesko went 3-for-3 and Kevin Millwood  
pitched four scoreless innings to lead Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Twins 6, Pirates 5    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Marty Cordova hit his first home run of the 	
spring, a three-run shot, and LaTroy Hawkins allowed three runs in 
five innings for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Dodgers 7, Mets 6, 10 innings 	
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Armando Benitez walked Tripp Cromer 	
with the bases loaded in the 10th inning.

<HEADLINE> Admin. Criticizes Crop Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and the Clinton administration  
fired opening salvos in the growing debate over how to pay for an 
overhaul of a farm crop insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican plan to spend an extra $6 billion over four years  
for the reforms doesn't seem possible, the Clinton administration 
charged Thursday. The White House hasn't even offered a plan, 
Republicans countered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to make pie-in-the-sky promises about things,''  
Sylvia Mathews, deputy director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget, said in an interview. ``What is real is the 
commitment and when you deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., called the administration's  
complaints ``ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton did not include additional money for crop  
insurance in his budget, even while maintaining his commitment to 
passing reforms, Chambliss said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty strong signal he had no intention of making  
any changes to crop insurance,'' Chambliss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate Budget Committees included the $6 billion  
in their budget resolutions. The amount spent each year would vary 
but it would be in addition to the $1.6 billion now spent on the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget resolutions are essentially blueprints for things GOP  
leaders would like to accomplish. The actual spending will be 
determined by legislation to be considered later. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said the Republican crop insurance  
proposal would require drastic cuts elsewhere in the budget. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has proposed a plan that would 
cost $2 billion to $2.5 billion more a year than current spending, 
but administration officials said they wanted to work with GOP 
leaders to develop a substantive funding plan. 
</P>
<P>
	With low crop prices expected to continue, lawmakers want to use  
crop insurance as a safety net to help farmers through the tough 
times. Reforms, they maintain, will help boost participation in the 
program. Many farmers don't have crop insurance, saying it is 
expensive or inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, taxpayers' dollars cover 60 percent of the  
program while farmers' premiums pay for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, Glickman appeared before exasperated  
lawmakers and defended an expected eight-month delay in getting 
$2.3 billion in emergency disaster aid to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is part of a $6 billion disaster aid package passed in  
October. Glickman said last week that the ``complex'' process of 
disbursing the money to farmers meant checks probably wouldn't go 
out until June. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not rocket science. This is not splitting the atom.  
This is something the department has done before,'' said House 
Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have gotten the money out in January,''  
Glickman said. ``We created a program from scratch. We're doing the 
best we can under these circumstances.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks U.S. Meeting on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alarmed over warnings that American military  
lives may soon be at risk, Senate leaders are demanding a 
face-to-face accounting from President Clinton on his 
administration's goals for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Senate is planning to take up legislation  
Monday that could block funds for any U.S. military involvement in 
the Serbian province without prior congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people need to have a better understanding what  
the United States' national security interests are, if any,'' 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and other Senate leaders received a briefing Thursday from  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other members of 
Clinton's national security team on the fragile status of peace 
negotiations between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in Paris and on the 
continued threat of U.S.-led NATO airstrikes against Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks broke down today and French and British mediators said  
in a statement they won't resume if the Serbs continue to reject 
the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no purpose in extending the talks any further,'' the  
mediators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, as she went into the closed-door briefing with  
lawmakers, said ``NATO stands ready to take whatever measures are 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterwards, Lott said he wasn't satisfied -- and requested a  
meeting with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton agreed to meet with the Senate leaders today.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't think that the predicate has been laid, that the  
Senate, let alone the American people, know enough about what the 
reasons are for potential airstrikes at this time,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are the risks? What do we hope to achieve? And what  
happens next? I'm just saying that we need to know a lot more than 
we presently have been advised,'' Lott added. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon's top military commanders told a  
Senate hearing that military action against Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's forces could be difficult and could result in 
American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said sentiment in the GOP-led  
Congress had changed from ``qualified support'' for administration 
policy ``to real serious debate over whether we should be heading 
into a long drawn-out campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, a White House spokesman on national security  
issues, said that at today's meeting, Clinton would emphasize 
``that the United States has a clear national interest in 
preventing a wider war from spreading in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes it's important to have strong  
bipartisan consensus here at home as we deliver a strict message to 
President Milosevic that his actions are intolerable and there will 
be further consequences if he does not abide by his obligations and 
agree to a political settlement that guarantees Kosovo's 
autonomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has warned it will bombard Serbian targets if Milosevic  
continues to resist a proposed three-year settlement to give Kosovo 
autonomy. The latest round of settlement talks in Paris appeared to 
be at an end Thursday, and it was unclear whether any more would be 
held or whether the Serbs would be given a few days to consider 
their position. Yugoslav forces appeared to be mobilizing for 
all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 people have been killed in a year of fighting in  
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant of two remaining 
republics comprising Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he's prepared to send up to 4,000 Americans  
there as part of a 28,000-member NATO force that would enforce the 
peace -- if a settlement is signed by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia's air defenses are sophisticated and heavily  
defended, Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are very good. So taking on these defenses with air  
power will not be easy. There is a distinct possibility we will 
lose aircraft in trying to penetrate those defenses,'' Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be tremendously dangerous,'' Marine Corps  
Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo nine-to-one. But the  
Serbian province remains under Serb control and the military 
directed by Milosevic from Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate had been poised to debate legislation by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, to sharply restrict funds for any U.S. 
military operation in Kosovo. But Senate leaders late Thursday 
postponed the debate until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation -- unlike a nonbinding House resolution passed  
narrowly last week voicing support for administration policy -- 
would be binding, denying funds for any U.S. involvement in a 
peacekeeping operation unless approved by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the prospects for U.S. military action in Kosovo, ``I am more  
convinced than ever that this is a mistake at this time,'' 
Hutchison told reporters after the Albright briefing.

<HEADLINE> Controversy Over Free Olympic Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Primo Nebiolo, one of the most  
powerful executives in international sports, was turned down by 
Sydney organizers on Friday when he requested an allotment of free 
tickets for sports officials at the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo, the head of track and field's governing body, is also  
president of the Association of Summer Olympics International 
Federations. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted at least 1 percent of the seats at all venues in  
Sydney set aside, making his request in his capacity as president 
of the Olympic group 
</P>
<P>
	That would amount to as many as 1,100 seats at the biggest  
venue, the 110,000-seat Olympic stadium where track and field will 
be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo might now take his case to the IOC at an executive board  
meeting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been told no, but Primo doesn't give up,'' said Don  
Porter, president of the International Softball Federation from 
Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo made similar demands of organizers of the 1996 Games in  
Atlanta but limited it to track. Last spring, he was turned down 
when he asked for 16,000 free tickets for the 15 track sessions in 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers did agree to the federation's requests that  
all technical officials for sports -- referees, timers and others 
who direct the competition on the field -- get single-room housing 
at Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a much better arrangement for all sports,'' Porter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Porter, one of just two U.S. presidents of international  
federations, was elected to the federation's policy making 
executive council, along with international swimming federation 
president Mustapha Larfaoui of Algeria and Olegario Vazquez Rana, 
the Mexican president of the international shooting federation.

<HEADLINE> Deficit Up Slightly in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal deficit came in slightly higher in  
February than a year earlier, but the government remains on track 
for a surplus by the end of fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's deficit, $42.9 billion, was 2.7 percent higher than  
the red ink in February 1998. But the deficit accumulated during 
the first five months of fiscal 1999, $27.5 billion, was 50 percent 
below last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect another, smaller, deficit for March, then a  
large surplus in April, when most Americans pay their tax bills. It 
should be enough of a surplus to put the government in the black 
for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government recorded a $69.2 billion surplus in  
fiscal 1998, which ended Sept. 30, the first year without a deficit 
since 1969. The Clinton administration is forecasting a $79.3 
billion surplus for 1999, and the Congressional Budget Office is 
even more optimistic: projecting a $107 billion surplus.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: US Must Have 'Will To Act' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With NATO air strikes looming, President  
Clinton today spelled out the need for risky American military 
action in Kosovo if Serbian leaders are bent on aggression. The 
allied nations must act, he said, because ``hesitation is a license 
to kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we and our allies don't have the will to act, there will be  
more massacres,'' Clinton declared, acknowledging at the same time 
that ``U.S. and other NATO pilots will be put in harm's way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first full-fledged news conference in nearly a year,  
Clinton also acknowledged that he had lied to the American people 
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky but called that just ``one 
negative'' that should be balanced against hundreds of good deeds. 
He noted that many allegations against him had been proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminded of George Washington's legendary statement that he  
could not tell a lie, Clinton said children can learn from his 
mistakes that people must tell the truth. ``I think that what young 
people will learn from my experience is that even presidents have 
to do that and there are consequences when you don't,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also dealt with a mounting controversy over alleged  
spying at U.S. nuclear installations. A Chinese-American working at 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was fired after 
allegations arose that secret information about nuclear weapons was 
given to the Chinese. The president denied that the administration 
reacted too slowly or out of political motivation in light of 
Chinese-Americans contributions to Democratic campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he said security measures at nuclear research  
laboratories have been too weak for ``years and years and years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid growing speculation about Hillary Rodham Clinton's possible  
political plans, the president said ``I literally don't have a 
clue'' whether his wife will run for a Senate seat in New York. He 
said she told him a year ago it might be a good idea to move to New 
York after they leave the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He said their marriage is still strong, despite a year of  
revelations about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. ``We're working 
hard. We love each other very much and we're working on it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, he declined to comment on a Little Rock, Ark.,  
woman's allegation that he sexually assaulted her when he was 
Arkansas' attorney general 21 years ago. His attorney denied the 
allegation in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He speaks for me,'' Clinton said. ``I think he spoke quite  
clearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a light moment, the president was asked why his enemies  
always pick on him. He told a long story in which God tells a man 
complaining about his fortunes: ``Son, there's just something about 
you I don't like.'' More seriously, Clinton said he feels he has 
lived a blessed life and enjoys being president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton brushed off personal criticisms leveled at him in books  
written by two former close associates, political adviser Dick 
Morris and counselor George Stephanopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't had any pain since I haven't read any of the  
books,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Clinton tried to increase pressure on the Serb-led  
Yugoslav government led by President Slobodan Milosevic, declaring, 
``Only President Milosevic stands in the way of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They have massed their troops. They have continued to take  
aggressive action. They have already leveled one village in the 
recent past, killed a lot of innocent people. I do not believe that 
we ought to have thousands more people slaughtered and buried in 
open soccer fields before we do something. I think that would be 
unfortunate, if we said we have to have a lot more victims before 
we can stop what we know is about to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly concerned about the possible conflict, Clinton said: ``I  
do not want to put a single American pilot in the air. I do not 
want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not want a conflict. I 
would give anything to be hear talking about something else. But a 
part of my responsibility is to try to leave to my successors an 
environment in Europe that is stable, humane and secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Serbs have had enough time to agree to peace,  
the president said, ``I think that threshold has been crossed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Defended Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the Democratic  
presidential nomination and faces allegations of padding his resume 
by claiming to have created the Internet. Clinton said Gore 
deserves ``a lot of appreciation'' for his efforts to promote the 
global computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he was concerned that the skyrocketing stock market  
appeared to be contributing to the dip in Americans' savings rates, 
and that those falling rates pose a threat to continued economic 
good times. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said he was taking a back seat to Attorney General Janet Reno  
in the debate over whether the independent counsel law should be 
allowed to expire because he was a target of Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr's investigation.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Ends Below 10,000; Down 94.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A poor showing for the bluest of the blue-chip  
stocks dragged the Dow Jones industrial average lower Friday, 
ending its strongest run yet past 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a Dow component dubbed ``Big Blue,'' skidded amid growing  
concerns over its revenue growth. IBM's woes sparked a selloff of 
technology stocks and sent the broader market lower as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 94.07 to close at 9,903.55, obliterating an early  
88-point surge that sent the blue chips to 10,085.31, their biggest 
push past the 10,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's best-known indicator has now passed 10,000 during  
three separate sessions, but has fallen back each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will make a couple more of these practice runs  
before we get past it,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment 
officer for equities at State Street Research and Management Co. 
``The market needs one really strong catalyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's early run past 10,000 was fed by two main sources.  
Japan's Nikkei stock index, buoyed by Wall Street's recent gains 
and increasing signs of an improved economy, rose 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, an analyst's favorable report on General Electric's growth  
prospects sent its shares rising. The Dow component finished up 2, 
at 112. 
</P>
<P>
	But around midday, concerns about IBM's revenue growth prompted  
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Thomas Kraemer to predict IBM's 
shares will reach 195 within 12 months, down from an earlier 
estimate of 210. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's shares plunged 9 1/16 to 168 9/16, responsible for nearly  
40 points of the Dow's loss. It also set off selling in a wide 
range of technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard, which 
fell 3 1/8 to 70 7/8, and Dell, which fell 2 to 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 41.69 to  
2,421.27. 
</P>
<P>
	There were bright spots in Friday's market. Shares of Nike rose  
6 3/4 to 61 3/4, a day after it reported earnings that far surpassed 
analysts' expectations. The sneaker giant's strong results offered 
a hint that the troubles it chalked up to the Asian financial 
crisis have eased. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, at least one stock soared in its initial public offering.  
Shares of iVillage, an operator of a Web site for women, were 
priced at 24, then rocketed as high as 100 before closing at 80 1/8 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane  
in Charlotte, N.C., said Friday's trading mirrored the activity in 
many recent sessions, with stellar performances and weak sectors 
co-existing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a schizophrenic market,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also held lower Friday by developments in the bond  
market. An upcoming offering of at least $6 billion in AT&AMP;T 
corporate bonds enticed many traders to sell government bonds to 
make room for AT&AMP;T in their portfolios, traders said. The 
bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 29/32 to 95 5/8, pushing the yield up 
to an attractive 5.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 17.26 to 1,299.29, and the  
NYSE composite index fell 6.93 to 610.68. The American Stock 
Exchange composite index slipped 2.99 to 711.87, and the Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.97 to 396.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
NYSE. Consolidated NYSE volume totaled 1.08 billion shares, up from 
913 million Thursday. ``Triple witching,'' the quarterly expiration 
of contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures, 
added volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Friday's sharp losses, the Dow ended the week up 27.20,  
or 0.3 percent, and analysts said they expect the index to resume 
its push to close above 10,000 next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But while ordinary investors and the media eagerly await the  
milestone, the professionals who buy and sell securities on the 
floor of the NYSE are ready to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all euphoric and we are all happy to be part of  
something positive and historic,'' said Robert B. Fagenson, NYSE 
vice chairman and a managing director of a specialist firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, this is a business for us and we would love  
to see it over and get along with something else.''

<HEADLINE>  Dow Jumps 50 to Top 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials charged above 10,000  
at the opening of trading today after flirting for days with its 
first five-digit close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was up 63.27 at 10,060.89 shortly after the opening  
bell. Broader U.S. stock market indexes also were rising and stocks 
were up sharply today on major world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow teased investors Thursday with a late bid at history,  
bobbing above 10,000 six separate times in the final 10 minutes of 
trading, only to creep back below and finish just 2.68 points 
beneath the vaunted milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the disappointment was another new high for the Dow,  
which rose 118.12 points for the day to close at a record 9,997.62. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also closed at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday  
morning, but pulled back after about a minute and closed with a 
loss. Thursday's high was 10,001.51, a shade below Tuesday's high 
of 10,001.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's last-minute flirtation with 10,000 sparked some  
confusion at the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
NYSE Chairman Richard A. Grasso and Dow Jones &AMP; Co. chief executive 
Peter Kann began celebrating too soon -- flinging baseball caps 
emblazoned with the words ``Dow 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 800 points, or nearly 9 percent, in 1999 --  
well on the way to what would be an unprecedented fifth straight 
year with a gain of at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While just a number, 10,000 would mark a crowning achievement  
for a resilient bull market that began more than eight years ago, 
on Oct. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has more than quadrupled since that time, driven by an  
extraordinary combination of positive factors, especially tame 
inflation, low interest rates, and a confident mood that has 
consumers buying everything from stocks to socks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main spark for Thursday's advance was a report that consumer  
prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month -- further confirmation 
that inflation remains in check and that the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing perception that the world's economic trouble spots are  
recovering has provided some extra fuel in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, investors were unfazed Thursday by a separate report  
from the Commerce Department showing that the nation's trade 
deficit shot up 21 percent in January.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Falls Below 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average drifted below  
10,000 today as an early Wall Street rally was deflated by weakness 
in IBM and dozens of smaller technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Dow was down 25.25 at 9,972.37. The index of blue  
chips soared nearly 88 points in the first hour of trading before 
sinking throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has struggled to extend its stay above the vaunted  
10,000 milestone. On Thursday, the Dow's 118.21-point gain was 
nearly overlooked as the index made six dramatic bounces above 
10,000 in the final minutes of trading. Thursday's close left the 
blue chips at a record high of 9,997.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust opening today turned around when IBM, a Dow component  
and bellwether technology stock, began to fall. Analysts have begun 
questioning the strength of computer makers' earnings for the 
nearly completed quarter. By midafternoon, when Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter lowered its 12-month IBM stock price target, shares fell 6 3/4 
to 170 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer makers also faltered, including Hewlett-Packard,  
which slipped 2 5/8 to 71 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component General Electric set off the morning rally after a  
Lehman Brothers analyst issued a favorable report on its 
international growth prospects. Its shares rose 2 3/8 to 112 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Nike reported earnings that far surpassed analysts'  
expectations, its shares rose 5 9/16 to 60 9/16. Nike's strong 
results offered a hint that the troubles it chalked up to the Asian 
financial crisis have eased. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks,  
reversed early gains and was down 25.31 at 2,437.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which has set its own string of  
records in recent weeks, also slipped after a strong morning, and 
was off 9.76 at 1,306.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a robust 736.4 
million shares, due to the quarterly ``triple witching'' 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of contracts on  
stock options, index options, and index futures. It typically adds 
to the market's volatility as portfolio managers rush to buy or 
sell stocks to square their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 3.95 to 613.66, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.23 at 711.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets around the world flourished following the Dow's strong  
rally on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei index soared 4.2 higher to its 
best finish since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DAX index closed 1.7 percent higher, Britain's FT-SE  
100 rose 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Market's Key Index Recovers / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index recovered to  
an eight-month high on a rally in blue chips today, rebounding from 
the previous day's sharp drop. The dollar slid against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.52 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.00  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 117.45 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 660.86  
points, or 4.20 percent, closing the week at 16,378.78 points -- its 
highest close since July 31. On Thursday, the average closed down 
550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, after hitting an eight-month high 
on Wednesday. Today's high was just a tick above that figure. 
</P>
<P>
	While today's rally was partially in reaction to Thursday's  
sharp drop, traders said investors were encouraged by continued 
corporate restructuring by Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors were large net buyers on the growing view that  
Japan's economy may have hit bottom, traders said. The rise in New 
York stocks overnight was another bullish factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 six times  
Thursday before closing at 9,997.62, up 118.21 points on the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 867  
million shares, down from Thursday's turnover of 1.30 billion 
shares. Advances outnumbered retreats 899 to 314, with 111 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Among today's gainers were blue chips, including Sony Corp.,  
Toyota Motor Corp. and Kyocera. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section picked up 38.52 points, or 3.13 percent, to 1,269.76. 
The TOPIX lost 28.85 points, or 2.29 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar slid as overseas investors  
bought yen to invest in rising Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just short-term foreign speculators but also  
long-term investors such as U.S. mutual and pension funds who are 
selling dollars for yen to invest in Japanese stocks,'' said Shuji 
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But other players retreated to the sidelines prior to a  
three-day weekend in Japan. The dollar ranged between 116.90 yen 
and 117.80 yen in today's trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Monday, March 22, for  
Spring Equinox Day, a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.36 yen, down  
from 130.77 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.665 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.685 percent, 
driving its price up 101.08 yen from 100.91 yen.

<HEADLINE> New Knitting Trends Displayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Forget the image of granny sitting in her  
rocker, wearing thick bifocals, maneuvering two huge knitting 
needles to fashion a woolly sweater with lopsided sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's knitters are making hip, body-hugging sweaters with  
psychedelic-colored yarns and are more likely to get their 
inspirations from top designers than the practical patterns of 
years past. 
</P>
<P>
	Before, ``people would have to knit socks because that was the  
only way to get socks,'' said Bonnie Byers, of Lawrence, Kan., a 
self-proclaimed obsessive knitter. ``They're knitting now because 
they enjoy doing it. To me, it's become an art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byers, who estimates she's been through about 18,200 yards of  
yarn in the past 35 years, is a member of the Knitting Guild of 
America, which boasts 10,000 members. This week, 300 devoted 
members from across the nation descended on San Diego for the 
guild's national convention, looking to trade knitting tips and 
learn a new stitch or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood and high fashion, particularly with retro 1970s  
styles, have helped boost the popularity of the needle arts with 
young people, Byers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crocheted hats were seen in the teen movie ``Clueless,''  
designer Barry Klein knitted a purple angora sweater for Olympic 
gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi, and several of his sweaters were 
worn by Freddie Kruger in the horror movie ``Nightmare on Elm 
Street.'' Master knitter Lily Chin has designed for the Gap and 
Victoria's Secret. 
</P>
<P>
	``You find cropped sweaters, tight and fitted rather than being  
this shapeless kind of crew neck sweater you used to find,'' said 
Byers, 44, as she thumbed through a pattern book of clothing 
modeled by young and tanned Generation Xers. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve-year-old Tess Bickford, of Steuben, Maine, began knitting  
at age 6 after seeing other people doing it and begged her mother 
to take a class. Now, they're both hooked and Tess has developed a 
specialty -- scarves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you something to do when you don't have anything to  
do. You can do it anywhere,'' said Tess, who mainly knits at home 
with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-day convention, which ends Sunday, gives knitters of  
all levels a chance to learn from the best, enter their work into 
contests, and get a peek at new yarns and other products not yet 
commercially available. Classes include Slip Sliding Away, Earnest 
Hemming Ways and Bias Knitting Without Prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some knitters eschew the traditional yarn colors of solid bone  
white, royal blue or brick red. Instead, they reach for 
multicolored tropical storm, green mountain madness and champagne 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weirder it is, the more they want it,'' said yarn dyer and  
wholesaler Cheryl Potter of East Montpelier, Vt. ``They tend not to 
want the straight mohairs and wools. They want something with 
pizzazz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there are still the traditionalists, like Ruth Wells, an  
87-year-old widow who has been working the needles since she was a 
girl. She was taught by her mother and grandmother as they knitted 
for the Red Cross during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Franklin, La., resident enjoys knitting free-hand and seeing  
the immediate results of her labor, such as her baby blue socks and 
sweaters for her dog Foxy. There are other benefits, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the finest therapy you can have, and much cheaper than  
psychiatry,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Ends Below 10,000; Down 94.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A poor showing for the bluest of the blue-chip  
stocks dragged the Dow Jones industrial average lower Friday, 
ending its strongest run yet past 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, a Dow component dubbed ``Big Blue,'' skidded amid growing  
concerns over its revenue growth. IBM's woes sparked a selloff of 
technology stocks and sent the broader market lower as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 94.07 to close at 9,903.55, obliterating an early  
88-point surge that sent the blue chips to 10,085.31, their biggest 
push past the 10,000 milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's best-known indicator has now passed 10,000 during  
three separate sessions, but has fallen back each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will make a couple more of these practice runs  
before we get past it,'' said Jim Weiss, deputy chief investment 
officer for equities at State Street Research and Management Co. 
``The market needs one really strong catalyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's early run past 10,000 was fed by two main sources.  
Japan's Nikkei stock index, buoyed by Wall Street's recent gains 
and increasing signs of an improved economy, rose 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, an analyst's favorable report on General Electric's growth  
prospects sent its shares rising. The Dow component finished up 2, 
at 112. 
</P>
<P>
	But around midday, concerns about IBM's revenue growth prompted  
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Thomas Kraemer to predict IBM's 
shares will reach 195 within 12 months, down from an earlier 
estimate of 210. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's shares plunged 9 1/16 to 168 9/16, responsible for nearly  
40 points of the Dow's loss. It also set off selling in a wide 
range of technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard, which 
fell 3 1/8 to 70 7/8, and Dell, which fell 2 to 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 41.69 to  
2,421.27. 
</P>
<P>
	There were bright spots in Friday's market. Shares of Nike rose  
6 3/4 to 61 3/4, a day after it reported earnings that far surpassed 
analysts' expectations. The sneaker giant's strong results offered 
a hint that the troubles it chalked up to the Asian financial 
crisis have eased. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, at least one stock soared in its initial public offering.  
Shares of iVillage, an operator of a Web site for women, were 
priced at 24, then rocketed as high as 100 before closing at 80 1/8 on 
the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane  
in Charlotte, N.C., said Friday's trading mirrored the activity in 
many recent sessions, with stellar performances and weak sectors 
co-existing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a schizophrenic market,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also held lower Friday by developments in the bond  
market. An upcoming offering of at least $6 billion in AT&AMP;T 
corporate bonds enticed many traders to sell government bonds to 
make room for AT&AMP;T in their portfolios, traders said. The 
bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 29/32 to 95 5/8, pushing the yield up 
to an attractive 5.55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 17.26 to 1,299.29, and the  
NYSE composite index fell 6.93 to 610.68. The American Stock 
Exchange composite index slipped 2.99 to 711.87, and the Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.97 to 396.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
NYSE. Consolidated NYSE volume totaled 1.08 billion shares, up from 
913 million Thursday. ``Triple witching,'' the quarterly expiration 
of contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures, 
added volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Friday's sharp losses, the Dow ended the week up 27.20,  
or 0.3 percent, and analysts said they expect the index to resume 
its push to close above 10,000 next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But while ordinary investors and the media eagerly await the  
milestone, the professionals who buy and sell securities on the 
floor of the NYSE are ready to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all euphoric and we are all happy to be part of  
something positive and historic,'' said Robert B. Fagenson, NYSE 
vice chairman and a managing director of a specialist firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand, this is a business for us and we would love  
to see it over and get along with something else.''

<HEADLINE>  Dow Jumps 50 to Top 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials charged above 10,000  
at the opening of trading today after flirting for days with its 
first five-digit close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was up 63.27 at 10,060.89 shortly after the opening  
bell. Broader U.S. stock market indexes also were rising and stocks 
were up sharply today on major world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow teased investors Thursday with a late bid at history,  
bobbing above 10,000 six separate times in the final 10 minutes of 
trading, only to creep back below and finish just 2.68 points 
beneath the vaunted milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the disappointment was another new high for the Dow,  
which rose 118.12 points for the day to close at a record 9,997.62. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also closed at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday  
morning, but pulled back after about a minute and closed with a 
loss. Thursday's high was 10,001.51, a shade below Tuesday's high 
of 10,001.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's last-minute flirtation with 10,000 sparked some  
confusion at the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
NYSE Chairman Richard A. Grasso and Dow Jones &AMP; Co. chief executive 
Peter Kann began celebrating too soon -- flinging baseball caps 
emblazoned with the words ``Dow 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 800 points, or nearly 9 percent, in 1999 --  
well on the way to what would be an unprecedented fifth straight 
year with a gain of at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While just a number, 10,000 would mark a crowning achievement  
for a resilient bull market that began more than eight years ago, 
on Oct. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has more than quadrupled since that time, driven by an  
extraordinary combination of positive factors, especially tame 
inflation, low interest rates, and a confident mood that has 
consumers buying everything from stocks to socks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main spark for Thursday's advance was a report that consumer  
prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month -- further confirmation 
that inflation remains in check and that the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing perception that the world's economic trouble spots are  
recovering has provided some extra fuel in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, investors were unfazed Thursday by a separate report  
from the Commerce Department showing that the nation's trade 
deficit shot up 21 percent in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average drifted below  
10,000 today as an early Wall Street rally was deflated by weakness 
in IBM and dozens of smaller technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m., the Dow was down 25.25 at 9,972.37. The index of blue  
chips soared nearly 88 points in the first hour of trading before 
sinking throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has struggled to extend its stay above the vaunted  
10,000 milestone. On Thursday, the Dow's 118.21-point gain was 
nearly overlooked as the index made six dramatic bounces above 
10,000 in the final minutes of trading. Thursday's close left the 
blue chips at a record high of 9,997.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The robust opening today turned around when IBM, a Dow component  
and bellwether technology stock, began to fall. Analysts have begun 
questioning the strength of computer makers' earnings for the 
nearly completed quarter. By midafternoon, when Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter lowered its 12-month IBM stock price target, shares fell 6 3/4 
to 170 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer makers also faltered, including Hewlett-Packard,  
which slipped 2 5/8 to 71 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component General Electric set off the morning rally after a  
Lehman Brothers analyst issued a favorable report on its 
international growth prospects. Its shares rose 2 3/8 to 112 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Nike reported earnings that far surpassed analysts'  
expectations, its shares rose 5 9/16 to 60 9/16. Nike's strong 
results offered a hint that the troubles it chalked up to the Asian 
financial crisis have eased. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks,  
reversed early gains and was down 25.31 at 2,437.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which has set its own string of  
records in recent weeks, also slipped after a strong morning, and 
was off 9.76 at 1,306.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a robust 736.4 
million shares, due to the quarterly ``triple witching'' 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of contracts on  
stock options, index options, and index futures. It typically adds 
to the market's volatility as portfolio managers rush to buy or 
sell stocks to square their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 3.95 to 613.66, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.23 at 711.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets around the world flourished following the Dow's strong  
rally on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei index soared 4.2 higher to its 
best finish since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DAX index closed 1.7 percent higher, Britain's FT-SE  
100 rose 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> St. John's, OSU Rely on Backcourt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- When St. John's and Ohio State play in  
the South Regional final Saturday they'll be looking to the little 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither team would be here without their guards,'' said St.  
John's coach Mike Jarvis, trying to get the Red Storm into the 
Final Four for the first time since 1985 in his first year at the 
helm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whichever team advances to the Final Four will represent their  
school well because of them. You cannot get to this point without 
them. It especially comes to light in the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's (28-8) starts Erick Barkley at the point. The 6-1  
freshman is tied with backcourt mate Bootsy Thornton as the 
Johnnies' leading scorer in three NCAA tournament games at 15.7 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (26-8) relies even more heavily on its backcourt for  
points. Point guard Scoonie Penn, who gets most of the credit for 
the Buckeyes' turnaround from last year's disastrous season, is 
averaging 16 points a game in the tournament. Guard Michael Redd 
leads at 21.3 points a game in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had my druthers, I'd prefer to have four double-figure  
scorers instead of two around 20 like we do,'' Ohio State coach Jim 
O'Brien said. ``We've been concerned about that all year. Teams 
often try to take Scoonie and Michael out. We've been fortunate. We 
always seem to find someone to take up the slack, and that changes 
from game to game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley said after Thursday's 76-62 victory over Maryland he  
felt he could go past Maryland's Terrell Stokes whenever he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, who will guard Barkley Saturday, found that interesting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we can play with anyone,'' he said. ``He had a  
great game yesterday. Maybe he did feel he could go by Stokes 
whenever he wanted to. I don't know if he'll feel that way about 
this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's does not rely as heavily on its guards for points,  
sporting an offense that defines ``balanced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, Thornton, Ron Artest and Lavor Postell are all  
averaging in double figures in the tournament, and the fifth 
starter, Tyrone Grant, averages nine points a game. All five 
averaged in double figures during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The versatile Artest, in fact, pulls a lot of backcourt duty at  
6-7. He was the trigger man in St. John's successful approach to 
Maryland's full-court pressure on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Penn and Redd, the next higher scorer for Ohio State in  
the tournament in Jason Singleton at eight points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is guard time, and Penn and Redd are a great backcourt,''  
Jarvis said. ``I think you'll see some great matchups. We'll have 
Erick on Scoonie and two or three people on Redd. If those 
combinations neutralize each other, it'll come down to the best 
front court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With only 40 minutes standing between them and a trip to the  
Final Four in St. Petersburg, Fla., Jarvis admits he's got a 
slightly different take on the situation than his players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to take the ride. I'm a journey guy,'' he said.  
``They're so focused on their goal. They're very excited, trust me. 
I think they're afraid if they show that, people will assume 
they're satisfied, and they're not satisfied. They don't want this 
to end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Being a game away from the Final Four is as much of a surprise  
to Ohio State as it is to anybody else. After finishing 8-22 a year 
ago, the Buckeyes admit they just hoped to make the tournament this 
year. The NIT would have been an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last season definitely helped us,'' said 6-11 senior center  
Ken Johnson, the Buckeyes' leading rebounder. ``We know what it's 
like to be on the bottom. Last year I didn't know anything about 
winning, about how to win. It was a terrible time.''

<HEADLINE> America West Prepares for Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Flight attendants at America West Airlines  
prepared Friday for random walkouts in a campaign they call 
``CHAOS'' that could leave up to 100,000 passengers stranded this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and the union met Friday for the third day in  
Washington, D.C., with federal mediators. The 2,300 flight 
attendants were free to strike after 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday -- the 
end of a 30-day cooling off period. 
</P>
<P>
	But union spokeswoman Deanna Clarkson said the talks had been  
extended until at least 1:30 a.m. EST. Flight attendants rallying 
outside the airlines' headquarters booed when told about the 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	America West serves 53 domestic destinations overall and eight  
cities in Mexico and Canada. It has hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, the nation's ninth largest, brought in extra  
ticketing agents and airport staff Friday at Phoenix Sky Harbor 
International Airport and McCarran International Airport in Las 
Vegas, said Stephen Johnson, America West vice president of public 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said the company had contingency plans to ``respond to  
every eventuality'' but said details of those plans were being kept 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Clarkson, spokeswoman for the Association of Flight  
Attendants, said: ``We're hoping and praying for an agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the union threatened a series of random, announced worked  
stoppages, dubbed CHAOS, for ``Creating Havoc Around Our System.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, it conducted a dry run to see how long it would  
take to get word to flight attendants that a flight was being 
struck and then to inform passengers. Clarkson said the flight 
attendants believe they can shut down the airline in 7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	America West has threatened to fire flight attendants involved  
in such a strike and has warned that it may shut down the entire 
airline if CHAOS strikes begin. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants have been locked in a feud with the  
airline for four years since they unionized in 1994 -- three years 
after America West filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	During the bankruptcy reorganization, flight attendants took a  
10 percent pay cut, which has not been restored. The company, 
buoyed by low fuel costs and good economic times, posted record 
profits in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants have been demanding that their pay be on  
par with the average of the top 10 carriers. Currently, about 
two-thirds of America West's flight attendants earn the top-scale 
salary of $23,800. Top-scale flight attendants at rival Southwest 
Airlines earn $41,200. 
</P>
<P>
	The flight attendants also want the same daily expenses that  
pilots receive, $1.80 an hour away from their base city. Currently, 
flight attendants get no per diem allowance.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Aid for Hog Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved giving hog farmers an  
extra $250 million in assistance to help them weather a sharp 
downturn in pork prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was added late last night to a $1.9 billion emergency  
spending bill that includes aid for Jordan and hurricane-battered 
Central America. The House is to take up its version of the 
legislation next week. President Clinton has threatened to veto 
both versions in a dispute with Congress over state tobacco 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department already is distributing $50 million  
to hog farmers on its own at a rate of $5 per pig. The department 
said Friday the payments average $1,100 for each of 45,293 farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Producers said the payments won't go far enough and appealed to  
Congress for as much as $500 million more. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a crisis and it demands action,'' Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., said Friday. ``The immediate, short-term economic assistance 
approved by the Senate can help producers survive the current 
crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogs are selling for about 25 cents a pound, up from a low at  
the end of 1998 of 8 cents but well below the break-even point of 
almost 40 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be up to the Agriculture Department to decide how to  
distribute the $250 million. The money could go for direct payments 
as well as loans or purchases of surplus pork. The National Pork 
Producers Council wanted $25 for every hog sold after the price 
collapse, up to a limit of $50,000 per farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very significant step,'' said Steve Cohen, a  
spokesman for the producers group. ``If this goes through, we can 
bring some financial relief to some of these farmers who are really 
teetering on the edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the White House opposes the overall bill, the Agriculture  
Department ``would certainly be open to moves by Congress to be of 
additional help to hog farmers,'' spokesman Andy Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bill also would authorize $1 billion in emergency  
farm loans and urges the Clinton administration to approve the sale 
of $500 million in grain and sugar to Iran. Clinton's national 
security advisers are weighing whether to grant a license for the 
shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only right decision here is to let that grain be sold to  
Iran,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ``It's absurd to have 
prohibitions on grain shipments, not just here but anywhere else as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said Friday the Senate's  
endorsement of the Iran sale ``will be noted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iran is asking for 2 million metric tons of wheat; 300,000 tons  
of rice; 200,000 tons of soybean meal; 400,000 tons of corn; 250,00 
tons of soy oil; and 400,000 tons of raw and white sugar.

	STOKE D'ABERNON, England (AP) -- Violinist Yehudi Menuhin was  
buried Friday at the school he founded, surrounded by music, 
family, friends and some of the young people whose talents he 
supported. 
</P>
<P>
	Menuhin died March 12 at age 82 while on tour in Berlin.  
</P>

	He was laid to rest under a tree he had planted at the Yehudi  
Menuhin School in southern England, as school musicians played 
works by Bach and Shubert.

the celebrated musician described his burial wishes.

<HEADLINE> Balloon Nears Round-the-World Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- One of two exhausted balloonists trying to become  
the first to circle the globe nonstop sobbed with joy and relief 
Friday when he was told they have enough fuel to reach the finish 
line in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes as planned, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and  
British adventurer Brian Jones will conquer one of the last great 
challenges in aviation on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, their 180-foot-high Breitling Orbiter 3 was more than  
halfway across the Atlantic, being swept along by a jet stream at 
up to 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Their control center in Geneva said they had gained about six  
hours and were on course to cross longitude 9 degrees west at about 
midday Saturday (7 a.m. EST). That's the same line where they began 
their trip nearly three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the balloonists are expected to be above  
Mauritania, on Africa's northwest coast. They plan to push on, over 
Algeria and Libya to Egypt, where they believe it will be easier to 
land and where Jones has long dreamed of ending the odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
	But if they're too tired, they will drift down in Mali, flight  
director Alan Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to put down in some part of the desert surrounded  
by lions, jackals and other dangerous animals, then we will do 
it,'' Noble said. ``But what we would dearly like to do is to get 
them down in Egypt near the pyramids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard broke into tears when controllers told him there should  
be enough fuel and that weather conditions were right for a landing 
in Egypt -- a total journey of 29,206 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a satellite telephone linkup, Piccard said he was using  
self-hypnosis to calm himself and cope with tension that has 
accumulated during the 19-day odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of stress,'' said Piccard, 41, who comes from a  
family of pioneers and is making his third round-the-world bid. 
``It's really not a picnic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is right down to the wire,'' said Jones, a 51-year-old  
balloon instructor. ``Of course we're hopeful and we're secretly 
confident, but we can't sit back in our chairs and make the winds 
take us there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of frustrating delays, Piccard and Jones set off  
from the Swiss Alps on March 1. They drifted down to North Africa 
and then crossed toward Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike rival balloonists, the Breitling Orbiter crew had an  
advantage in that they got permission to pass over southern China, 
a move that saved them vital time. They then picked up a fast jet 
stream over the Pacific before grinding to a near halt over Central 
America. There the pilots developed breathing problems and got the 
shivers as their small cabin chilled to 46 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very stressed and very cold,'' Piccard recounted.  
``But now it's all going well again and we've put it behind us as a 
bad dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon finally picked up a jet stream again Thursday. Early  
Friday, they beat the endurance record set two weeks ago by two 
British balloonists who later ditched in bad weather near Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Once at its destination, the balloon probably will hover and  
make its final descent at dawn Sunday but a night landing was not 
out of the question, Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have night vision goggles onboard, which are fairly  
powerful. But the desert is not all sand dunes. There are quite a 
few mansions there, which would be uncomfortable.''

<HEADLINE> Congressional Retreat Set for Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting House lawmakers to agree to spend this  
weekend learning how to get along better with members of the 
opposite party has been no easy task for the organizers of 
Congress' second civility retreat in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	But organizers of the gathering that kicks off today with a  
speech from Northern Ireland peacemaker John Hume persuaded close 
to 200 members of Congress and their families to come along. And in 
this impeachment-strained time, they're calling that success even 
though their original goal was to arrive in Pennsylvania with a 
majority of the 435-member House. 
</P>
<P>
	The group left this morning for Hershey aboard a chartered  
train. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can restore faith in democracy,'' House Minority Whip David  
Bonior, D-Mich., said before boarding the train. ``I think we will 
come back better people and we will have a better institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., added: ``The way the institution of  
Congress is set up, there are only one or two places for Democrats 
and Republicans to get together. We need to do something about 
that. ... Hershey's about finding our common ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We go into this with our eyes wide open about how difficult it  
has been to put this together. But the very difficulty of it is 
what makes it so important,'' said Rep. Tom Sawyer, the Ohio 
Democrat who is leading this year's civility drive along with 
Illinois Republican Ray LaHood. ``The contributions of the most 
skeptical member could be the real success of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say their best argument is that little progress is  
likely to be achieved on issues like Social Security and Medicare 
if partisan tensions are too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is no one gets a bill passed with just your own  
members,'' LaHood said. ``Politics is about relationships, and you 
don't achieve success without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Launched after the Republican takeover saw vitriol in the House  
reach new heights, the first retreat drew 200 members to the 
chocolate-making town in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But few of that gathering's dozens of recommendations became  
reality. And just weeks after the gathering, two veteran lawmakers 
nearly came to blows on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the post-Hershey I news is not all bad.  
</P>
<P>
	A study released this week found the last Congress as civil  
overall as previous ones. The only exceptions were the three days 
in December of debate and voting on the impeachment articles 
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't a two-year problem,'' said Kathleen Hall  
Jamieson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School 
of Communication and one of the study's authors. ``There was a 
three-day problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers insist this year's retreat is attracting about as  
many Democrats as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	All the top leaders are expected to attend, too, and they have  
been much more enthusiastic in their support this time, members 
said. Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Bonior sent a 
joint letter urging all House members to attend. Both sides also 
enlisted their powerful whip organizations to round up 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, actor Sam Waterston will present Abraham Lincoln's  
writings. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat of the weekend comes Saturday as members are divided  
into bipartisan work groups for frank discussion of what's wrong 
and brainstorming for solutions. The weekend wraps up Sunday with 
participants agreeing on a small list of recommendations and 
getting a send-off speech from historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
	The retreat is being funded by the Philadelphia-based Pew  
Charitable Trusts, with only nominal fees paid by House members, 
and run by the Aspen Institute.

<HEADLINE> Expos Can Use Olympic Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- After its roof was torn during a snowstorm in  
January, Olympic Stadium received a clean bill of health Friday for 
the Montreal Expos upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	The city fire department and the provincial building inspection  
office said the stadium was OK for use from April 1 to Nov. 30. The 
Expos' home opener is set for Thursday, April 8, against the New 
York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Work on a new $37-million roof, installed by the American firm  
Birdair, was almost finished when one of 63 panels tore Jan. 18. 
The avalanche slightly injured five people who were setting up for 
a car show. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal engineering firm of Rousseau, Sauve, Warren and  
Associates said the roof structure is solid. It will be monitored 
and no work will be done on it while the stadium is in use. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest roof was installed after its predecessors had ripped  
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	The original retractable roof was never installed for the 1976  
Olympic Games because engineers decided it wouldn't work.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Wants Spelling Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. offered to buy the rest of Spelling  
Entertainment Group Inc., just months after saying it might sell 
its majority stake in the producer of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and 
``Melrose Place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom -- the owner of Paramount Pictures, MTV and Nickelodeon --  
announced Friday it would pay $162 million for the 20 percent of 
Spelling it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone had said late last year that  
Viacom would consider selling its stake in the company run by famed 
producer Aaron Spelling because it duplicated Paramount's TV 
production business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Viacom has decided instead to buy all of Spelling and  
combine some of its administrative functions with Paramount's 
production arm to trim costs, while retaining Spelling's wealth of 
past and current hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The outstanding 20 percent stake in Spelling is publicly traded  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Viacom's $9-per-share offer pushed 
Spelling's stock up $2.25 to match the $9 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer must be approved by Spelling's independent directors.  
</P>
<P>
	Spelling's current hits include ``7th Heaven'' and ``Charmed''  
on the WB network and the syndicated ``Judge Judy.'' ``Melrose 
Place'' is ending its seven-year run on Fox this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling's huge library includes some of the most popular shows  
in TV history, including ``Dallas,'' ``The Love Boat,'' ``Charlie's 
Angels,'' ``Bonanza'' and ``Little House on the Prairie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom gained its 80 percent stake in Spelling when it acquired  
Blockbuster Entertainment in 1994. Viacom later put Spelling up for 
sale, but scrapped the plan in 1996 after failing to receive an 
adequate offer.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Captures America's Heartmatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In Salt Lake City, John Stockton is jazzed.  
Somewhere in crooner heaven, Bing Crosby must be warbling 
``Hallelujah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, the school that brought Stockton and Crosby to the  
world, is producing NCAA tournament magic in the West. One more 
victory Saturday and the little Jesuit college from Spokane, Wash., 
will be in the Final Four, the first No. 10 seed to make it that 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstacle, however, is Connecticut, the No. 1 seed, a team  
with speed, depth and two of the country's best players, Richard 
Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin. It's a team ready to finally erase 
coach Jim Calhoun's stigma of coming close again and again but 
never quite getting his team to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who impatiently refutes the notion that his program  
can't win the big ones, praises Gonzaga as no fluke, not after 
tournament victories over Minnesota, Stanford and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception will be that this is a David and Goliath  
thing,'' Calhoun said. ``It isn't. I told our players that Gonzaga 
isn't a national name, but it is a national team. You don't worry 
about what name is on the jersey. You need to worry about what's in 
the jersey, and they have a lot of heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention at least six players who can make 3-pointers with  
deadly accuracy, and oft-overlooked front-line players who were 
able to outrebound Stanford and got the winning basket, on Casey 
Calvary's tip-in, in Thursday night's 73-72 victory over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of an obscure team with a confident, loose  
personality and an intriguing, pass-oriented style that emphasizes 
teamwork has made the Bulldogs the darlings of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's America and they love the underdog,'' Gonzaga coach Dan  
Monson said Friday. ``It is a great story. We've only been in the 
tournament once and we've never won a game before. The other thing, 
I would hope, is the quality of kids we have. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at those kids and say, `Hey, these are good kids  
who play basketball the right way, who are fun to watch.' You can 
see their chemistry and how well they like each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of the tournament, the Zags have insisted they  
belong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't come into the tournament feeling like, `We're here.  
We've finished our season. We made it to the NCAA tournament; now 
let's get stomped by somebody,''' Calvary said. ``Game after game, 
we've been confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That confidence even extends to a game against Connecticut, a  
team that has won 31 of 33, a team whose least-known starter, 
Calhoun notes, got more national attention than the entire Gonzaga 
team this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants their moment,'' Calhoun said, ``and this is  
their moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson knows that Connecticut has more talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we had to play Connecticut 10 times over the long haul,  
we'd be in pretty big trouble,'' Monson said. ``But the bottom line 
is we don't have to play them 10 times. We've got to play them for 
40 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's players are shrugging off the burden of Calhoun's  
legacy. This is the fourth time Calhoun has taken the Huskies to a 
regional final in the 1990s. He's lost the other three -- to Duke, 
UCLA and, last year, to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no control over the past teams that never reached the  
Final Four,'' El-Amin said. ``All we can do is focus on this year. 
We know we have a good shot of reaching it. You're going to see a 
very feisty group out there just ready to take care of business. We 
can only focus on this year and what we can do right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun repeatedly points out that his Connecticut teams have  
won more than 800 games, and more than 70 percent of their NCAA 
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win tomorrow, I won't be any better coach,'' he said.  
``If we are unfortunate and we lose tomorrow, I won't be any worse 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies aren't just talking Final Four, they're talking  
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all the talent on our team to do it,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	First, the Huskies must hold off Gonzaga's perimeter game, a  
3-point barrage that Calhoun hasn't seen since Rick Pitino's 
Providence team shot its way into the Final Four in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In its three tournament games, Gonzaga is 32-for-63 from 3-point  
range (51 percent), while shooting just 39 percent from inside the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zags, meanwhile, will try to get more offense from inside,  
and somehow keep the Huskies from running. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to try to make them be a jump-shooting team,''  
Monson said. ``Nobody's really been successful at that all year, 
but that's something we've got to go in and try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Zags insist they will be expecting to succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you hope you make a shot, it's not going in. You've got to  
expect it's going in,'' Monson said. ``We've got to expect to win 
tomorrow. That's the attitude I've had with these kids in every 
game we've played this year, and certainly tomorrow's got to be no 
different.''

<HEADLINE>  Gonzaga Celebrates Tournament Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Bing Crosby's statue never looked  
jauntier. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ol' Bing, a celebrated Gonzaga alum, decked out in a  
blue-and-white NCAA basketball T-shirt and a ``Go Zags!'' sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Elite Eight fever infected the straitlaced Gonzaga campus  
following the school's thrilling 73-72 upset of Florida on Thursday 
night at the NCAA West Regional in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,500 students turned out to celebrate the victory -- the  
biggest gathering in memory at the small Jesuit-run school with 
just 4,506 students. Shirtless members of the crew team ran through 
the crowd. Other students hung from trees and some rode an antique 
fire engine from a local pizza joint, siren wailing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the tidy turn-of-the-century campus was back to normal  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Delirious celebrants picked up after themselves, and the statue  
of the famed crooner was back to its everyday color: gray. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's indicative of the spirit here,'' security director  
Jeffery D. Hart said. ``I think there's a reputation that we're 
more studious and regimented than other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've shown we can have fun, Everybody is getting in on it  
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University president Robert Spitzer and several other campus  
administrators have spent much of the week in Phoenix. With them 
are hundreds of students who fled chilly Eastern Washington in 
charter buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who stayed behind are getting used to empty seats in  
classrooms, and visiting television crews. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been really difficult to study at all this week,'' said  
senior Peter Tuenge, a history and philosophy double-major from 
Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The professors are being lenient, which is great. They've  
become caught up in the excitement, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's been no shortage of artists to spray-paint Bulldog  
tributes on a campus wall set aside for graffiti. On Friday, they 
were busily putting an Elite Eight design over earlier work 
commemorating the Bulldogs' first- and second-round victories over 
Minnesota and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's that Jesuit magic,'' graffiti artist Laura Curd said.  
``It's almost like God's on our side. Everything is falling into 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though bursting with pride, fans conceded the 10th-seeded  
Bulldogs may need divine assistance to defeat top-seeded 
Connecticut in Saturday's regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be near the end of the run, but with the way things  
have been going, another upset is definitely possible,'' freshman 
Mark Case said. ``We might go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we won't be a Cinderella team anymore. Next year, everyone  
will be shooting for us,'' Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's heady stuff for a school with an annual athletic budget of  
just $3.2 million and no football program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team is amazing, and they deserve all the attention  
they're getting. Their 15 minutes of fame is long overdue,'' 
student Allie Stender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any expectations coming into the tournament, so  
the excitement has just been building with each win,'' Tuenge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball success is nothing new at Gonzaga, which plays in the  
low-profile West Coast Conference and sent the NBA John Stockton. 
Gonzaga has won at least 20 games six times this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tournament run has been good for business at Jack  
and Dan's, the off-campus bar owned by Jack Stockton, John's dad. 
</P>
<P>
	The bar has been standing-room-only during each of Gonzaga's  
NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the biggest thing that's ever happened here,''  
Stockton said. ``And it hasn't been bad for my business at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday night's victory, ``Seventy-one-year-old people  
were hugging 22-year-olds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really dumbfounded. It's unbelievable.''  
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Bulldogs lose Saturday, the school will have  
succeeded in getting more of the national media to pronounce the 
school's name correctly. For the record, it's Gon-zag'-uh. 
</P>
<P>
	The university, founded in 1887, is named for St. Aloysius  
Gonzaga, a 16th century Jesuit remembered these days as the patron 
saint of youth.

<HEADLINE> Carbon Monoxide Alarms Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A North Carolina company is reportedly  
recalling 1 million carbon monoxide alarms because they may sound 
too late or not sound at all. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary recall by Kidde Safety Co. of Mebane, N.C., was to  
be announced Friday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
according to The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Being recalled are 350,000 Lifesaver model alarms and 650,000  
Nighthawk models. CPSC officials said the Lifesaver model may fail 
to sound at all and the Nighthawks might sound too late after the 
concentration of carbon monoxide exceeds safe levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the recall follows a study last month by the  
Gas Research Institute, a private laboratory financed by the 
natural gas industry, that found that 12 out of 80 carbon monoxide 
detectors, or 15 percent, were defective when they were purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	CPSC and Kidde officials were quoted as saying they know of no  
deaths or injuries related to the recalled products. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidde officials told the Post that the alarms worked when they  
left the factory wrapped in airtight packaging. They said fumes 
from solvents, glue, ink and other materials used in the packaging 
may have caused the alarm sensors to lose their sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	About 560 deaths occur each year from carbon monoxide inhalation  
and at least 11,000 people a year seek hospital treatment because 
of poisoning from the odorless, colorless gas.

<HEADLINE> News Conference Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Long before the Capital Beltway existed,  
President Woodrow Wilson asked reporters to help him avoid what is 
known today as an ``inside the Beltway'' mentality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do not tell the country what Washington is thinking,  
for that does not make any difference,'' he said in the first 
presidential press conference held in the White House East Room, 86 
years ago this week. ``Tell Washington what the country is 
thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, President Clinton held his first full-fledged news  
conference in almost a year in the room where Wilson spoke to the 
press about bridging the gap between the preoccupations of official 
Washington and the concerns of real people across the country. That 
gap has taken the name of the highway now ringing the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 200 reporters attended the remarkable session with Wilson  
on March 22, 1913, a week after a short, crowded press conference 
in his office, said Martha Joynt Kumar, who is writing a book on 
Clinton and the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that this gathering has a degree of formality which I  
wish it might not have,'' Wilson began. ``If there were any other 
room in which we could have met, it would have been more pleasing 
to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson asked not to be quoted directly. He also had written  
questions submitted in advance, said Frank Aucella, museum director 
at the Woodrow Wilson House in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The stenographer's transcript shows Wilson trying to establish a  
smooth and active relationship with the press shortly after taking 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Washington what the country is thinking,'' he implored,  
``and then we will get things with a move on, we will get them so 
refreshed, so shot through with airs from every wholesome part of 
the country, that they cannot go stale, they cannot go rotten, and 
men will stand up and take notice, and know that they have got to 
vote according to the purposes of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's papers at Princeton, where he had been university  
president, refer to 21 presidential press conferences between March 
and June of 1913, said university archivist Ben Primer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton has answered a limited number of questions from  
reporters in many appearances with foreign leaders, he had last 
held a full, solo news conference at the White House on April 30, 
1998. That one featured 16 questions about Monica Lewinsky, but few 
answers on the subject.

<HEADLINE> Plymouth, Mercury May Be On Outs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Plymouth and Mercury may be headed the way of  
DeSoto and Edsel. 
</P>
<P>
	The two venerable names in automaking recently announced that  
they would stop selling most of their cars in Canada, fueling 
speculation that their days are numbered in the United States too. 
</P>
<P>
	Many industry analysts say it seems inevitable that  
DaimlerChrysler AG will eliminate the Plymouth brand within the 
next several years and that Ford Motor Co. is mulling a similar 
fate for Mercury. 
</P>
<P>
	Both automakers say no decision has been made to kill the  
brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some things down the road,'' Mercury spokesman Jim  
Trainor said Friday from the division's new Los Angeles-area 
headquarters. ``The reports of our demise are greatly 
exaggerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the most telling sign may be that both product lines have  
been getting thinner and thinner, especially at Plymouth, with few 
new models planned by either company to spruce up their offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Plymouth dates back to 1928, when the former Chrysler Corp.  
introduced the four-cylinder car with the six-cylinder DeSoto. 
Lincoln, a unit of Ford, introduced the Mercury in 1938; Edsel 
Ford, the son of Henry Ford, chose the name. 
</P>
<P>
	Plymouth and Mercury mostly sell slightly different versions of  
cars already sold by their bigger sister divisions. With marketing 
costs on the rise, the industry has been moving away from the 
costly and often counterproductive practice of trying to market the 
same car under two different brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to stop throwing money at brands that can't be  
resurrected,'' said analyst George Peterson of AutoPacific Inc., an 
industry consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Neon, a Plymouth subcompact sold in larger numbers  
under the Dodge name, has been redesigned. The only other 
mass-market Plymouth car, the compact Breeze, is also a Dodge twin 
and production analysts say it won't be replaced with the next 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mercury, the only unique products are the new Cougar, which  
is sold as a Ford overseas, and the Villager minivan, a version of 
which is sold by Japan's Nissan as the Quest. All other Mercurys 
are Ford twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury recently ceased production of its subcompact Tracer, and  
analysts expect the Mystique compact to be pulled after the 2000 
model year and the Villager to be axed in a few years when Ford 
adds a minivan to its newly acquired Volvo line. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, when DaimlerChrysler recently announced plans to  
produce its retro-look PT Cruiser, an affordable car-van hybrid, 
most in the industry were surprised to hear that it would be a 
Chrysler. The vehicle seemed a natural for Plymouth, which the 
company has tried to position as a youthful, entry-level brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a done deal,'' Peterson said. ``What  
DaimlerChrysler is doing with Plymouth is like what it did with the 
Eagle brand: not renewing the product line and just letting it fade 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mercury's Trainor said the division has plans to replace its  
other model lines, including the Mountaineer sport utility vehicle 
that's a rebadged Ford Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts doubt Ford will keep the new Mountaineer  
for long after next year's debut because they expect Lincoln to get 
a luxury version of the new Explorer as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lincoln is where Ford is really putting its emphasis, not  
Mercury,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	What may slow down the brands' demise are their most popular  
models: the Plymouth Voyager minivan and the Mercury Grand Marquis, 
a full-size sedan. Dealers may be unwilling to give them up without 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury sold 114,162 Grand Marquis last year, outselling its  
Ford twin, the Crown Victoria. Plymouth sold 156,971 Voyagers, well 
behind its Dodge Caravan twin but ahead of most of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name is strong and you don't want to lose that,'' said Wes  
Brown, an analyst with Nextrend. Brown said DaimlerChrysler may 
decide to rebadge the Voyager as a Chrysler and market it as an 
entry-level alternative to Chrysler's luxury Town and Country 
minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	And, Brown said, there's no reason why the Plymouth Prowler -- a  
retro limited-production hot rod -- couldn't continue in its role as 
a showroom traffic-builder for Chrysler dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come as both automakers consolidate their dealerships  
and link more of their brands together. Most Chrysler dealers also 
sell Plymouths and Jeeps. Mercury dealers also sell Lincolns.

``It's almost like God's on our side. Everything is falling into 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though bursting with pride, fans conceded the 10th-seeded  
Bulldogs may need divine assistance to defeat top-seeded 
Connecticut in Saturday's regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be near the end of the run, but with the way things  
have been going, another upset is definitely possible,'' freshman 
Mark Case said. ``We might go all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we won't be a Cinderella team anymore. Next year, everyone  
will be shooting for us,'' Case said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's heady stuff for a school with an annual athletic budget of  
just $3.2 million and no football program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team is amazing, and they deserve all the attention  
they're getting. Their 15 minutes of fame is long overdue,'' 
student Allie Stender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any expectations coming into the tournament, so  
the excitement has just been building with each win,'' Tuenge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball success is nothing new at Gonzaga, which plays in the  
low-profile West Coast Conference and sent the NBA John Stockton. 
Gonzaga has won at least 20 games six times this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tournament run has been good for business at Jack  
and Dan's, the off-campus bar owned by Jack Stockton, John's dad. 
</P>
<P>
	The bar has been standing-room-only during each of Gonzaga's  
NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been the biggest thing that's ever happened here,''  
Stockton said. ``And it hasn't been bad for my business at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday night's victory, ``Seventy-one-year-old people  
were hugging 22-year-olds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really dumbfounded. It's unbelievable.''  
</P>
<P>
	Even if the Bulldogs lose Saturday, the school will have  
succeeded in getting more of the national media to pronounce the 
school's name correctly. For the record, it's Gon-zag'-uh. 
</P>
<P>
	The university, founded in 1887, is named for St. Aloysius  
Gonzaga, a 16th century Jesuit remembered these days as the patron 
saint of youth.

<HEADLINE> Suit vs. Pats' Bledsoe Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The woman who sued New England Patriots  
quarterback Drew Bledsoe and lineman Max Lane over a dive from a 
nightclub stage has agreed to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott R. Behman, a lawyer for the Paradise Rock Club, one of the  
defendants in the suit, confirmed that the settlement had been 
finalized Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tameeka Messier of Maynard sued the Paradise, the players and  
Portland, Ore.-based band Everclear, claiming she was seriously 
injured when Bledsoe and Lane dove off the stage into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	She accused all of the defendants with negligence in connection  
with the injuries she suffered, and also accused Bledsoe and Lane 
of recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Messier claimed that the band invited the two players on stage  
and that guitarist Art Alexakis encouraged Bledsoe and Lane to dive 
from the stage into the crowd at the Nov. 13 show. She said first 
Lane and then Bledsoe jumped from the stage and landed on her, 
sending her to the hospital for neck surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Messier, who was 23 when the incident happened, underwent  
surgery to remove two damaged disks from her neck and take pieces 
of a hip bone to fuse her spinal column. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe had reported Friday that Messier had settled  
for $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane's attorney, Steve Comen, and Behman both said that number  
was not accurate. However they would not say how much money the 
settlement involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globe, citing confidential sources, reported that insurance  
companies for the Paradise and Everclear would each pay $100,000. 
Bledsoe would contribute $400,000 and Lane would pay $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe's contract earns him $42 million over seven years while  
Lane earns $11 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe, who weighs 235 pounds, and Lane, who weighs 305 pounds,  
admitted they dove off the stage on Nov. 13, 1997, but said they 
did not cause Messier's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Messier's lawyer were not immediately returned Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- Chad Fleischer and Kirsten Clark won the  
men's and women's national downhill championships Friday on the 
Snowbasin Ski Resort's brand new Wildflower course. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer, a two-time Olympian who just came off the World Cup  
circuit, finished in 1:13.54, nearly a half-second better than 
runnerup Daron Rahlves, the two-time national giant slalom 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Next were Marco Sullivan at 1:14.48, Paul Casey Puckett at  
1:14.58 and Dane Spencer at 1:14.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's race had few high-profile skiers. Olympic champion  
Picabo Street, a two-time winner of the event, is missing her third 
straight national championships because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark won her second consecutive national downhill title with an  
aggressive run of 1:18.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to come back and race in the U.S.,'' said Clark, of  
Raymond, Maine. ``I had trouble with some of the technical parts of 
the course during training, but today I was a lot better. This is 
great for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Lalive, who won the gold medal in combined at the World  
Junior Championships in France last week, was second at 1:18.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety, who in 1995 won the last women's national  
championship race at Snowbasin, and Jonna Mendes tied for third at 
1:18.40. Katie Monahan took fifth at 1:18.57. 
</P>
<P>
	The course got high marks in its first test of competitive  
skiing. Designer Bernhard Russi's latest creation will be the site 
of the 2002 women's Olympic downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildflower will host an International Ski Federation downhill on  
Saturday. The next national championship to be contested will be 
the women's super-G on Sunday.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom,  
sidelined since early February with a concussion, said Friday he 
will sit out the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Buekeboom said at a news conference that he

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Down by Eight / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States slipped by eight on Friday to a 
record low of 526. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 114 were exploring for  
oil and 412 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported. 
During the same week last year, 937 rigs were operating in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom. It reached the previous record low of 531 on Feb. 19, 1999 
after four straight weeks of plunging counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recent gains, weak oil and gas prices over the past few  
months are to blame for the lack of drilling activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes says there probably are fewer domestic rigs looking  
for oil and gas now than at any time since industry's emerging days 
of the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Alaska, California  
and Louisiana each gained one rig. The count remained unchanged in 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas and Wyoming each lost four rigs, while New Mexico lost  
three.

<HEADLINE> Viacom Wants Spelling Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viacom Inc. offered to buy the rest of Spelling  
Entertainment Group Inc., just months after saying it might sell 
its majority stake in the producer of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and 
``Melrose Place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom -- the owner of Paramount Pictures, MTV and Nickelodeon --  
announced Friday it would pay $162 million for the 20 percent of 
Spelling it doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone had said late last year that  
Viacom would consider selling its stake in the company run by famed 
producer Aaron Spelling because it duplicated Paramount's TV 
production business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Viacom has decided instead to buy all of Spelling and  
combine some of its administrative functions with Paramount's 
production arm to trim costs, while retaining Spelling's wealth of 
past and current hits. 
</P>
<P>
	The outstanding 20 percent stake in Spelling is publicly traded  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Viacom's $9-per-share offer pushed 
Spelling's stock up $2.25 to match the $9 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer must be approved by Spelling's independent directors.  
</P>
<P>
	Spelling's current hits include ``7th Heaven'' and ``Charmed''  
on the WB network and the syndicated ``Judge Judy.'' ``Melrose 
Place'' is ending its seven-year run on Fox this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling's huge library includes some of the most popular shows  
in TV history, including ``Dallas,'' ``The Love Boat,'' ``Charlie's 
Angels,'' ``Bonanza'' and ``Little House on the Prairie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom gained its 80 percent stake in Spelling when it acquired  
Blockbuster Entertainment in 1994. Viacom later put Spelling up for 
sale, but scrapped the plan in 1996 after failing to receive an 
adequate offer.

<HEADLINE> Detective in Ramsey Case Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Linda Arndt, who was the only detective in  
John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, 
has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt handed in her resignation letter Thursday. Police services  
director Mark Beckner declined to comment and officials wouldn't 
release the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, after Mrs. Ramsey called 911 to report finding a 
2 1/2-page ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records said Arndt asked Ramsey to search the house for  
anything unusual. He went downstairs and emerged minutes later with 
the body of 6-year-old JonBenet, who had been beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made in the case, though the Ramseys remain  
suspects. A grand jury has been hearing evidence since 
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder police have been heavily criticized for failing to  
promptly separate and interrogate the Ramseys and for allowing 
Ramsey to recover the body of the little beauty pageant queen. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrelenting criticism and the department's response to it  
are at the heart of a federal lawsuit Arndt has filed against the 
city and former Police Chief Tom Koby, who resigned in November 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt claims her right to free speech was impeded by a  
department-wide gag order blocking officers from discussing the 
case. She is suing Koby for what she considered his failure to 
correct others' ``false, damaging and defamatory'' statements about 
her work. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt testified before the grand jury last fall but has remained  
publicly silent about her involvement in the case.

<HEADLINE> How Nuclear Poll Was Taken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on nuclear power is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,015 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted March 
12-16 by ICR, of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Do you support or oppose using nuclear power to generate  
electricity? Support, 45 percent; oppose, 31 percent; don't know, 
23 percent; refused to answer, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. (Asked only of the 493 respondents who support nuclear power)  
Would you support or oppose the construction of a nuclear power 
plant within 10 miles of your home? Support, 47 percent; oppose, 51 
percent; Don't know, 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Do you think nuclear power plants in the United States are  
safer now than they were 10 years ago, or not? Safer, 61 percent; 
not safer, 21 percent; don't know, 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Do you think radioactive waste from nuclear power plants can  
be safely stored for many years, or not? Yes, 31 percent; no, 47 
percent; don't know, 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How would you rate the likelihood of a serious accident at a  
nuclear power plant in the United States -- highly likely, likely, 
unlikely or highly unlikely? Highly likely, 13 percent; likely 37 
percent; unlikely, 27 percent; highly unlikely, 18 percent; don't 
know, 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Wins Darlington Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon, looking to establish  
early-season dominance, took another step in that direction Friday 
by winning the pole for the TranSouth 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, with two victories in four starts this year and five in  
his last seven outings at Darlington Raceway, ran the third-fastest 
lap in the history of NASCAR's oldest superspeedway. He went 
173.167 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' said Gordon, who wanted to build momentum  
after winning five days earlier at Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``The 
car was just right, and I gave it everything I had. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably the most confidence I've had in a race car in  
a long time. I knew I could drive into the first turn really hard, 
and that's one of the keys to qualifying here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has emphasized the importance of starting near the front of  
the field on a track Winston Cup drivers consider the most 
difficult of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, seeking to tie a record by winning his third straight  
title and fourth overall, covered the 1.366-mile oval in 28.398 
seconds in a Chevrolet. What was so impressive was that he came 
close to the record Ward Burton set at 173.797 three years ago -- 
after the track had been repaved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon had the second-fastest speed behind Burton on the record  
qualifying run of 1996, and was able to break 173 again because of 
his approach to qualifying on what is called ``the track to tough 
to tame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt the speed I carried through the first two turns was as  
fast as anybody could go,'' he said. ``After we got through three 
and four, I knew is was a fast lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was capable of more than I was.''  
</P>
<P>
	Burton, one of the best qualifiers on the circuit, had a bad  
run. He was just 28th and, with only the top 25 spots locked in, 
will have to try again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just real disappointed,'' he said. ``We're definitely  
better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A surprising second was Johnny Benson, who took the outside of  
the front row in a Ford with a lap of 172.541. His teammate, Mark 
Martin, who earlier in the day won the pole for the Busch series 
Diamond Hill 200 on Saturday, will start third off a speed of 
171.878. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't ask for a better lap,'' Benson said. ``I was going  
to be happy just to be in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was satisfied with his lap, although he wondered at first  
if he would finish it on a day when so many cars had problems in 
both Winston Cup and Busch Grand National practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty loose there on that lap, and it took my breath  
away,'' Martin said. ``I'm still a little bit in shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth was the Chevrolet of points leader Mike Skinner at  
171.830, followed by John Andretti's Pontiac at 171.782. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 25th pole of Gordon's career and second at  
Darlington, where he has won the Southern 500 a record four times 
in a row in addition to his 1996 victory in the TranSouth 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett, hoping to tie David Pearson's mark of three  
straight victories in the Darlington spring race, qualified 21st in 
a Ford. He was not happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best we've been today, but that's not saying  
much,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mast will start sixth Sunday, followed by Kevin Lepage and  
Bill Elliott. Qualifying ninth was Jeff Burton, second to Gordon in 
each of the last two Southern 500s. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Stewart was 10th for Joe Gibbs Racing, which suffered a  
blow in the morning. Bobby Labonte, second in the points, broke his 
right shoulder in a practice crash for the Busch race he won last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Kenseth was unable to qualify the car for Labonte, but  
still figures to relieve him early in the race Sunday.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton tried to brace the nation  
today for airstrikes in Kosovo following the collapse of peace 
talks, saying he knew military action would put American lives at 
risk but ``if we don't act the war will spread.'' With Clinton 
suggesting NATO action against Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic may be close, the State Department began evacuating the 
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and the Pentagon sent more warplanes to 
the region. Congressional leaders said they were persuaded that 
Clinton was ready to act -- and needed to warn Americans that 
military action could include risk to U.S. pilots.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today dealt with a mounting  
controversy over alleged spying at U.S. nuclear installations. A 
Chinese-American working at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico was fired after allegations arose that secret information 
about nuclear weapons was given to the Chinese. The president 
denied that the administration reacted too slowly or out of 
political motivation in light of Chinese-Americans' contributions 
to Democratic campaigns. Nonetheless, he said security measures at 
nuclear research laboratories have been too weak for years.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average today made its  
biggest move yet past 10,000, but fell back once again, unable to 
make its first close above that milestone. The Dow made it all the 
way to 10,085.31 in early trading, and actually spent more than 
half the session trading above five digits. But weakness in 
technology stocks wiped out the Dow's gains, and it ended the day 
at 9,903.55, down 94.07. Declines led advances on the NYSE 
1,814-1,166. The Nasdaq was down 41.47 at 2,421.49.

	MOSCOW (AP) -- A bomb ripped through a busy market today in  
southern Russia, cutting down a crowd of shoppers, shattering 
vegetable stalls and leaving a city in chaos. At least 62 people 
died and scores were injured. An anonymous group claimed 
responsibility for the worst attack since a 1992 ethnic war killed 
hundreds in North Ossetia, a republic in Russia's volatile Caucasus 
region. Police called the explosion a terrorist act and were 
searching for two suspects, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New drugs such as Prozac and old standbys such  
as Elavil are about equally effective in treating many types of 
depression, although patients on the newer drugs may have slightly 
fewer side effects, according to a study. An analysis of 264 
studies of 32 different anti-depression compounds found ``no 
significant differences'' in efficacy among adult patients when new 
drugs were compared with those that have been around for many 
years, according to researchers at the Evidence-Based Practice 
Center in San Antonio.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Top-ranked Duke, ridding a  
school-record 29-game winning streak, will take on 12th-seeded

<HEADLINE> Feds Slam State Lotteries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of a federal commission on gambling  
roundly criticized state lotteries Friday after reviewing a report 
charging that scratch-off and lotto-type games use deceptive 
advertising and constitute a regressive tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The report to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission  
found that 5 percent of lottery players account for 50 percent of 
the money spent, that blacks spend four times more than whites and 
that states aggressively promote their lotteries with pitches 
promising a better life. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission members did not hide their concern.  
</P>
<P>
	``This attacks the very group of people we're trying to help to  
raise their incomes, get educated, get a work ethic,'' said 
commissioner Robert Loescher, a member of the Tlingit Tribe of 
Alaska and president of Sealaska Corp., a land management company. 
</P>
<P>
	But George Andersen, president of the North American Association  
of State &AMP; Provincial Lotteries and director of the Minnesota 
Lottery, said the state-run games are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We answer to very critical policy-makers and media,'' he said.  
``No one watches anyone like we are watched. We live in glass 
houses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the casino industry, lotteries have no representative on  
the nine-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia run lotteries;  
Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina are among the states 
considering creating a lottery. Americans spent some $36 billion on 
lottery tickets in 1997, and more than $11 billion of that went to 
state coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was written by Duke University researchers led by  
professors Charles Clotfelter and Philip Cook. Their 1989 book, 
``Selling Hope,'' took a skeptical view of American lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook told the commission that he sometimes buys lottery tickets  
and that lotteries are among the most popular state programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I get uncomfortable,'' he said, ``is where the state  
crosses the line to active promotion of this activity, just as I'd 
be uncomfortable with them actively encouraging people to drink 
alcohol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cook reported that while a ``stunningly high'' number of  
Americans play lotteries on occasion, a hard-core group of 5 
percent of players is responsible for half the money spent. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure led commissioners to wonder how lotteries are  
contributing to pathological and problem gambling. The commission 
released a survey on Thursday concluding that more than 20 million 
Americans have or could develop a gambling problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the results of that survey, Cook also dramatically  
increased his previous estimates of how much money is spent by 
black Americans on lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	While blacks as a group are less likely to buy lottery tickets  
than whites, Cook said, those blacks who do play spend an average 
of $998 a year -- compared with $210 for white players.

<HEADLINE> Temple's Sanchez Has Unlikely Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Early this season, the mention of a  
Purdue-Temple game in a NCAA tournament regional wouldn't have 
raised any eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	Both schools got off to fast starts, were nationally ranked and  
had the talent to do some damage in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the season progressed, dark days descended on both  
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple, of the Atlantic 10 Conference, lost top shooter Lynn  
Greer to an eye injury after six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, junior guard Quincy Wadley severely bruised his left  
hand and missed the conference tournament. He's back now, but is 
still hurting a little. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening the season with a 12-1 record against mostly  
non-conference foes, Purdue struggled in the Big Ten, losing 11 of 
18 games, including five of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
	So when the NCAA tournament selections came out, much wasn't  
expected of either sixth-seeded Temple (23-10) or 10th-seeded 
Purdue (21-12). 
</P>
<P>
	Both have beaten the odds so far, and they will square off  
tonight as more confident teams in a Sweet 16 game at the 
Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a very talented team at the beginning of the  
year,'' Temple coach John Chaney said Thursday. ``I really thought 
that our team could do something special, and then all the sudden I 
thought I was snake-bitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue didn't have major injuries, but coach Gene Keady wasn't  
happy with his team's attitude or its defense down the stretch. 
Still, the veteran coach felt the Boilermakers deserved a seventh 
straight NCAA berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a chance if our attitude changed,'' Keady  
said. ``We needed to be of a family instead of being selfish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a first-round 58-54 win over Texas, Purdue became that family  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of us had forgotten what the feeling of winning  
was like,'' Purdue forward Brian Cardinal said. ``We were excited. 
It was an unbelievable feeling and I think that gave us a lot of 
confidence going into Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers showed that confidence in beating second-seeded  
Miami 73-63 behind a 20-point performance by Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple got to the Sweet 16 by beating Kent State 64-51 and  
third-seeded Cincinnati 64-54. Both wins were a product of the 
Owls' tough zone defense, particularly against the Bearcats, who 
were limited to 34.7 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every team we have played out of conference sometimes doesn't  
have a clue about the zone,'' senior guard Rasheed Brokenborough 
said. ``Teams in conference prepare for it, but other teams don't 
have a scheme for it. We play great defense. ... We know our 
defense is going to keep us in every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensively, Temple is patient and tries to limit its turnovers.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what makes point guard Pepe Sanchez so important. The  
Argentine junior played 77 of a possible 80 minutes and had 29 
points, 10 assists, eight rebounds, seven steals and three 
turnovers in the opening two games of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I play a game, my goal is not to be the star of the  
game,'' said Sanchez, an All-Atlantic 10 first-team selection and 
its defensive player of the year. ``My goal is to be the most 
regular person on the floor and to have balance and to be cool 
thinking about what I am doing. 
</P>
<P>
	Keady called him the glue of the Owls and possibly the best  
decision-maker at point guard in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	If Purdue wants to get to the regional championship, it will  
have to continue to play good defense and solve Temple's zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner will play either top-ranked and top-seeded Duke  
(34-1) or 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State (22-10) on Sunday in 
the regional championship that everyone expects Duke to win.

<HEADLINE> Twins' Carrasco To Miss 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Minnesota Twins reliever Hector Carrasco  
will miss at least three months this season after an operation to 
relieve an arterial blockage in his throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrasco tentatively is scheduled for surgery in Chicago on  
Monday. He was hospitalized last week with numbness in his right 
hand. Doctors found blood clots in his armpit and elbow, and 
blood-thinning medication dissolved one and reduced the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best-case scenario is that he'll be out for three,  
three-and-a-half months and return at the end of the season,'' team 
physician Dan Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The repeat arteriogram (performed Wednesday) showed a  
relatively high area of blockage still there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will involve taking out a piece of the artery in  
Carrasco's shoulder and grafting in a piece of vein from his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss is a blow to the Twins, who had been impressed with  
Carrasco this spring. Carrasco was 4-2 with a 4.38 ERA last year 
for the Twins.

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Life in Meteorites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The same NASA team that says it found microbial  
life in a Martian meteor now claim two other meteors contain 
similar fossilized remnants. 
</P>
<P>
	What appear to be bacteria are contained in two meteorites  
believed to be from Mars, according to a team led by Johnson Space 
Center geologist David S. McKay, who presented his findings 
Thursday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA team's latest findings, made within the past six  
months, were from samples of a 1.3 billion-year-old meteorite that 
fell to Earth in 1911 near Nakhla, Egypt, and a 165 
million-year-old meteorite that fell near Shergotty, India, in 
1865. 
</P>
<P>
	``My own opinion is that these will turn out to be true  
micro-fossils from Mars,'' McKay said. ``We're not counting on 
getting many converts. All we ask, though, is that people keep an 
open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist was one of the researchers who in August 1996  
announced the discovery of tiny fossilized structures in crevices 
of a 4 billion-year-old Mars meteorite found in the Allan Hills 
region of Antarctica in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three years, rival researchers and other scientists  
have debated the significance of the NASA team's earlier findings 
from Mars. Independent analyses of the Mars rock have failed to 
yield absolute evidence that the potato-sized chunk ever contained 
life.

<HEADLINE> Two Die In Shooting Over Will Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSON CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- A gunman who blamed a lawyer for an  
ambiguity in his ex-wife's will that cost him $100,000 fatally shot 
the attorney and one of the lawyer's clients. 
</P>
<P>
	John D. Goodin, 81, was shot in the head Thursday and died a  
short time later at a hospital. Paul S. Keyser III -- a 35-year-old 
man who simply was in the wrong place at the wrong time, according 
to police -- was shot in the chest and died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour after the shooting, Walter V. Shell, 71, turned  
himself in, Police Chief Ron Street said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and was  
being held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell had been designated the executor of the estate of his  
former wife, Katie Roselle Shell. The two had remained friendly and 
he had taken care of her as she was dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But five days before she died on Nov. 9, Goodin visited her in  
the hospital and helped her amend the will, naming one of her 
friends the executor and making some minor updates elsewhere, 
according to Fred Lance, a lawyer who helped Goodin in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't sure why she changed the will.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shell's assets included about $100,000 worth of stock. In  
her will, she left property and some money to her ex-husband and 
some to their two grown daughters, and then specified that any 
money left over also go to her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	But after her death, his daughters got a court to agree that  
since the will did not include the word ``stock,'' the $100,000 in 
stock was not covered by the document and should go automatically 
to them as Mrs. Shell's closest relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell apparently held Goodin responsible even though he handled  
only the revision to the will and not the original, Lance said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodin, a decorated World War II veteran, was well-known in  
Johnson City. He opened his law firm in there in 1939, was a city 
judge from 1980-85 and was a president of the Washington County Bar 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, at age 66, Goodin told the Johnson City Press that he  
had no immediate plans of retiring from his law practice because he 
was ``addicted'' to his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known very few lawyers who had the guts to quit when they  
should,'' he told the newspaper. ``I hope I have sense enough to 
retire or quit before I become a liability to anybody that comes in 
to get me to represent them.''

<HEADLINE> School Reconsiders Slavery Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- For six years, Amy Fowler has tied  
her students' hands and ankles and lined them up side-by-side on 
the floor at John Adams Middle School to teach them about slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	That will change.  
</P>
<P>
	School officials will revise the lesson after parents said it  
trivialized the journey of African slaves across the Atlantic and 
was demeaning to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt emotions can be stirred,'' said Rhonda Younger of  
the John Adams African-American Parent Support Group. She refused 
to let her daughter participate in the program last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you never know how a child will be affected. These were  
their ancestors, after all,'' she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hour-long lecture and slide show, the eighth-grade  
students lay on the floor and were bound to each other by tying 
their wrists and ankles with rubber bands to simulate the journey 
of slaves from Africa to America. 
</P>
<P>
	This year was the first that Fowler received complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to avoid controversy by sending home permission  
slips this time, just to be safe, but it seems like the opposite 
happened,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will be changed next year after discussions with  
parents, principal Jerry Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesson was devised by the Teachers' Curriculum Institute in  
Mountain View. Program author Bert Bower, who has received 
complaints from two other schools, said he would change it so that 
students are not bound. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find it is inappropriate to bind students during the  
slavery exercise,'' he said. ``We made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 300 students who took part said they enjoyed the  
class. Only five complained about the program, Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighth-grader Leonard Steed, 13, who is black, said he hoped the  
school would use the same lesson next year because it gave him a 
better sense of what life was like for slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really shouldn't be angry,'' he said near a photo  
display for the program depicting a scarred slave and plantation 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Adams, a history consultant with the California  
Department of Education, said the lesson fails to demonstrate the 
seriousness of historical events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to me like the school has a misguided sense of  
social empathy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sooners, Spartans To Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The proud football traditions of Michigan State  
and Oklahoma might show themselves when the two basketball teams 
meet tonight in the semifinals of the NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams run when the opportunity is there, but otherwise  
they're content to grind away and pound their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Spartans (31-4) have averaged 72.5 points, 13  
more than their opposition. No. 13 seed Oklahoma (22-10) averages 
71 points, its opponents 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson only half-kiddingly says a missed  
shot by Michigan State is like a designed play because the Spartans 
go to the boards so well. They average 18 offensive rebounds per 
game, twice as many as their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have an offense that sometimes is down and dirty, but we  
get the job done,'' said Antonio Smith, Michigan State's leading 
rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans, winners of 20 straight, coasted past College of  
Charleston in the first round of the tournament, then had to rally 
late to beat Mississippi. They have averaged just 64 points in the 
past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we have not been impressive offensively,  
maybe throughout the year, but especially the last couple of 
weeks,'' coach Tom Izzo said. ``But part of that is the teams we've 
been playing. Some of it has to do with the fact we maybe do not 
have the same weapons like an OU or some other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans do have an All-American in guard Mateen Cleaves. At  
195 pounds, he's 25 pounds heavier than Oklahoma point guard 
Michael Johnson, which will make him tough to stop. Cleaves isn't a 
great scorer, but he scores important points, as he showed in 
carrying Michigan State past Ole Miss last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched eight games where I thought he was the main reason  
they won at the end,'' Sampson said. ``He has an infectious 
enthusiasm about him. I think it's important for a point guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera brings the same kind of enthusiasm to  
the court. The 6-foot-8 junior can guard the post, but also defend 
on the perimeter, and he can score inside or outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Najera had 17 points and 13 rebounds against Arizona and  
followed that with 20 points and 15 rebounds against North 
Carolina-Charlotte. If the Sooners are to stay with Michigan State, 
they almost certainly will need another big game from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a guy that loves the adulation he's getting,''  
Sampson said. ``As he's matured, he's developed into the player he 
is now. when he's rebounding and aggressive, he can do special 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Michigan State is in the regional semifinals for the  
second straight year, Oklahoma hasn't been this far since 1989. 
They got here by playing outstanding defense, rebounding well and 
shooting effectively from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners made 10 3-pointers in a first-round upset of No. 4  
seed Arizona, then made 13 against North Carolina-Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to shoot a lot more 3s than we do,'' Izzo said.  
``Yet a lot of our styles are similar -- the plays we run, the way 
we check, the way we offensive rebound. I'm looking forward to a 
great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a physical one, although Sampson said his team can't afford  
to get too physical with the bigger and more athletic Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to Joe Frazier them, go toe-to-toe and see  
what happens,'' he said. ``We're going to have to trick them.''

	The International Olympic Committee's executive board said it  
was taking over the ethics investigation from a panel that produced 
six expulsions. That takes the investigation out of the control of 
Dick Pound, a vice president and chairman of the panel and a 
longtime friend of Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	The board heard from Coles today hours after it received a fax  
from his ex-wife, Georgina, confirming the gold-and-diamond 
necklace and cufflinks described in news reports the last week had 
been received on an inspection trip to Greece in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of the fact that a communication has been received  
from a third party, the executive board decided to investigate the 
matter further,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he ``appreciated the opportunity to explain the  
situation to the executive board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would remain on leave from the board of the  
organizing committee for next year's Summer Games in Sydney ``until 
the matter is resolved.''

</P>
<P>
	Coles has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and repeated today that  
he would not resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The jewelry is at the heart of the latest accusations that Coles  
repeatedly violated rules limiting gifts from bid cities to $150. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgina Coles sent a fax to IOC director general Francois  
Carrard and Pound, saying the jewelry was given to her and her 
then-husband during a visit to the Greek capital in 1990 by a ``man 
associated with the Athens bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athens lost the '96 race to Atlanta in September 1990.  
</P>
<P>
	In the fax, received at IOC headquarters early today from  
Australia, Georgina Coles said she had the cufflinks turned into 
earrings. A photo in today's Sydney Morning Herald showed her 
wearing what the paper said were those earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the two IOC officials this would be her final comment  
on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who led the IOC's internal investigation that expelled  
six members in the Salt Lake bribery scandal, said before the board 
meeting that he had not seen the fax and could not comment. He said 
Thursday he would wait for Georgina Coles to provide information 
before deciding weather to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, absolutely not,'' he said when asked if he planned to step  
down from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Sydney, Olympics boss Michael Knight called on Coles to  
``stop the pain'' by quitting the board of SOCOG, the organizing 
committee for the 2000 Games.

<HEADLINE> Crabber Capsizes in Bering Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Four fishermen were missing and feared  
dead today after a Kodiak-based crab boat rolled over and sank in 
the central Bering Sea, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of five crewmen from the fishing vessel Lin-J was found dead  
shortly after Thursday's accident, and Coast Guard aircraft and the 
cutter Hamilton were searching for the four remaining crewmembers. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was hampered 20-foot seas and winds blowing more than  
40 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten- to 20-foot seas makes it very difficult to spot people in  
the water, and I don't know if they had any survival suits or 
anything,'' said Tod Lyons, a Coast Guard spokesman in Kodiak. 
</P>
<P>
	The 96-foot Lin-J capsized about eight miles northwest of St.  
Paul Island, off Alaska's western coast. Lyons said the Coast Guard 
still didn't know why the vessel rolled while fishing for opilio 
crab. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabbing in the Bering Sea in the winter is considered one of  
the nation's most hazardous fisheries. Already this season, two 
people have been killed and several others seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In late February, a 31-year-old crewman fell overboard from  
another vessel in rough seas about 60 miles west of St. Paul. A 
month earlier, a 41-year-old man went overboard about 30 miles 
southeast of St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
	On the East Coast, four accidents in two weeks this January  
claimed the lives of as many as 10 clam fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Two accidents off New Jersey, blamed on bad weather, left two  
crewmen dead and six presumed dead. A sinking off Massachusetts 
killed two. Three crew members jumped overboard and escaped injury 
in the fourth accident off Manasquan, N.J., when their skipper fell 
asleep at the wheel and the boat struck a jetty.

<HEADLINE> Worker Convicted for Violent E-mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- A postal worker who told a co-worker by  
e-mail he might ``go postal'' and set off a ``shootout at the OK 
Corral'' has been sentenced to 15 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can no longer laugh off things like this from postal  
workers,'' U.S. District Judge George Kazen said when he sentenced 
John Murillo on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Murillo, 48, was convicted in December of transporting a threat  
across state lines. Although the e-mail was sent to a friend in 
Laredo, prosecutors said the message passed through several states. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are trying everything to make me go postal,'' the message  
read. ``This Mexican can only take so much. You kick a dog so much 
and sooner or later that chain will snap. I have been very patient 
with them but I am tired and making plans. ... Judgment day will 
come. It will be a shootout at the OK Corral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Espinoza, who received the message, turned it over to  
postal inspectors. Espinoza testified he laughed when he read it. 
</P>
<P>
	Murillo and his attorney, public defender Juan R. Flores,  
contended the case was about freedom of speech.

<HEADLINE> Victim May Have Targeted Clinic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A man who died when he accidentally  
detonated a pipe bomb in his lap was planning to use the device to 
destroy an abortion clinic to keep an acquaintance from having an 
abortion, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Keith Hill, 24, suffered massive injuries when the bomb  
detonated Wednesday as he apparently was finishing constructing it. 
A second, dormant bomb was found in his home with a container of 
gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents said  
Hill, who had made comments to friends about his plans to blow up 
the clinic, was not part of ``a group or larger political 
conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This did not seem to be an attack aimed at a person, but  
towards the facility,'' said Bob Dowlen, an ATF agent. ``From the 
very beginning, everything indicated that he was acting alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not release the name of the clinic Hill planned to  
bomb, but officials did say the clinic received a threat on March 
4. Hill had been seen near the clinic on at least two occasions, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came to the clinic irate, demanding entrance, and he was  
seen near the clinic during a protest,'' said police spokesman Bill 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police refused to reveal the connection between Hill and the  
female acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill had an extensive criminal history, with several convictions  
for aggravated assault. He was never charged with anything related 
to bomb-making.

<HEADLINE> Plumber Hits at New Baseball Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Nolan West knew he was breaking the rules. But  
immortality called. 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing his work day Monday installing beer lines at the  
Seattle Mariners' new stadium, Safeco Field, West grabbed his hard 
ball and 34-ounce bat and headed for the field. 
</P>
<P>
	There, he had a friend videotape him as he tossed the ball in  
the air, hit it and raced around the bases, sliding head-first into 
home plate without ever losing his hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old plumber from Lynnwood had apparently just made  
the first ``hit'' in the new baseball stadium. He dropped off the 
video at a local TV station, which aired his feat. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time the smack of the bat was heard at the  
construction site. During a brief visit last July that was more 
public relations than practice, Ken Griffey Jr. and a couple other 
Mariners batted some balls. But no one ran the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	West's employer was not amused; West was cut loose two days  
short of finishing the $30-an-hour, 10-day job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody got really upset, telling me, `This is not your  
playground,''' West said Thursday. ``One woman who works for the 
(Mariners) concessions told me I had tainted the field and that I 
did $2 million worth of damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was a couple hundred dollars' damage when the  
infield's protective tarp was torn, Mariners spokeswoman Rebecca 
Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only groundskeepers are allowed on the field, which has  
sensitive drainage and irrigation systems and hundreds of miles of 
heating coils for the natural grass turf. 
</P>
<P>
	West was given his walking papers by Polar Beer Systems of  
Santee, Calif., which had hired him. 
</P>
<P>
	West said he didn't mind getting canned, though.  
</P>
<P>
	``Running around those bases made it all worth it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners are scheduled to play their first game in the new  
ballpark on July 15.

<HEADLINE> Minivan, Pickup Gas Tanks Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency is investigating  
DaimlerChrysler's popular minivans and some General Motors pickups 
to determine if side-impact crashes could cause gas tank leaks, 
sparking fires. 
</P>
<P>
	National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigators are  
looking into the fuel tank construction on minivans from model 
years 1996-1999, including the Town and Country, Dodge Caravan and 
Grand Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager minivans, 
agency documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2 million of the minivans are on the road, the safety  
agency estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	During a federal crash test of a 1999 Dodge Caravan minivan, the  
hose that channels gasoline from the gas pump into the minivan's 
fuel tank pulled loose, and half the tank's fuel spilled out, an 
agency report said. The crash test simulates a vehicle crashing 
into the side of the minivan at 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Sheila Gruber McLean said Friday  
that the company was ``carefully reviewing'' the Jan. 5 crash test 
and cooperating with federal investigators. She said the company 
had discovered no similar complaints of fuel leakage or fires from 
hoses coming loose in crashes on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials also are investigating the tanks on some  
Chevrolet S-10 pickups to determine whether they may be punctured 
in side-impact crashes, leak fuel and cause fires. 
</P>
<P>
	The GM investigation involves model year 1999 pickups with  
four-cylinder engines, but agency officials said it could be 
expanded to other model years. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency conducted a side-impact crash test on one of the  
pickups in November, and the fuel tank was pushed into the drive 
shaft. The drive shaft punctured the gas tank, leaking gasoline. 
The drive shaft is connected to the axle that turns the wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	After the test, GM introduced a production change that added a  
shield to the tank, according to agency documents. Pickups with 
six-cylinder engines already have shields. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither agency officials nor the company had an immediate  
estimate of how many of the four-cylinder vehicles without the 
shield are on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cooperating fully with the investigation,'' said GM  
spokesman Terry Rhadigan.

<HEADLINE> Painter Draws Shakespearean Scenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George Romney painted portraits of the rich  
and famous in England 200 years ago, now considered some of the 
finest work of his time. He hated it, calling portraits ``the 
shabby part of my art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Romney preferred was drawing wild scenes from Shakespeare.  
Washington's Folger Library, one of the world's great collections 
of Shakespeare material, has brought out 153 of its nearly 500 
Romney drawings and a few paintings, nearly all Shakespearean 
scenes, for a show. 
</P>
<P>
	Most have never been exhibited or reproduced before.  
</P>
<P>
	Lady Hamilton, later Adm. Horatio Nelson's mistress, was  
Romney's favorite model for the Shakespeare scenes. Then she was 
just Emma Lyon, and he painted her as Joan of Arc, as Titania, 
queen of fairyland, and as the ax-wielding prophetess Cassandra in 
Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later he did a portrait of her husband, Sir William Hamilton,  
the British ambassador to Naples, that belongs to the National 
Gallery of Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Romney and his model came from northern England's poor and  
poorly educated and made their fortunes -- he as a society painter, 
she as mistress to several members of the nobility, said Yvonne 
Romney Dixon, who teaches art history at Washington's Trinity 
College and is in charge of the show. An ancestor of hers was 
Romney's uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's model was about 20 when she first came to sit for him,  
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably shared a North Country accent,'' Dixon said -- an  
important matter at a time when accents stamped a person's social 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Romney's self-portrait, Dixon put a quotation from a  
letter he wrote to a friend: ``This cursed portrait-painting! How I 
am shackled with it! I am determined to live frugally, (so) that I 
may enable myself to cut it short, as soon as I am tolerably 
independent, and give my mind up to those delightful regions of the 
imagination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Romney, Shakespeare's plays created the most important  
imaginary region. Instead of the beautiful but stiff oil paintings 
of politicians and society ladies that brought him prosperity, he 
loved to do rapid drawings of witches and fairies and heroes. His 
free, impressionistic style looks like work done a century or two 
later. 
</P>
<P>

Shakespeare Library. Admission is free.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Peace talks aimed at ending the fighting in Kosovo  
were adjourned today and mediators said the negotiations would not 
resume unless Serbs decide to accept the accord already signed by 
the ethnic Albanians. The collapse of the talks raises the prospect 
of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, and international monitors 
will withdraw from Kosovo as soon as possible. The Serb government 
opposes an element of the agreement that calls for NATO troops to 
be stationed in Yugoslavia.

	Dozens Killed in Russian Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- At least 42 people were killed and dozens injured  
today when a powerful bomb exploded in a crowded outdoor food 
market in southern Russia. The bomb exploded in downtown 
Vladikavkaz, the regional capital of North Ossetia, which borders 
the breakaway region of Chechnya. The blast raked the busy market, 
shattering stalls and vehicles. Police officers in Vladikavkaz put 
the death toll at 50 with more than 100 injured. The region is 
close to Chechnya, which claimed independence from Russia after a 
1994-96 war. Many parts of Chechnya are controlled by armed groups.

	Source: Train Witness Faults Truck

	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- A federal source says an eyewitness  
told authorities the driver of a truck involved in a deadly Amtrak 
derailment Monday tried to maneuver the truck through closed 
crossing gates just before it was struck by the train. The 
eyewitness account supports what the train's engineer told National 
Transportation Safety Board officials. Eleven people were killed 
and more than 100 injured in the nation's worst railroad accident 
in three years. The 14-car train slammed into the truck loaded with 
steel rods at 79 mph in a rural crossing 50 miles south of Chicago. 
The driver reportedly said he couldn't see the train coming and the 
gates were up when he entered the crossing.

Switzerland early today were halfway across the ocean, being pushed

refusal would be bad for the IMF as well as Russia. An IMF mission 
has been in Moscow for more than a week to prepare a report on 
Russia's finances before Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov visits the 
United States next week for talks on resuming loans from the fund. 
Russia is mired in economic recession and has said it will not be 
able to pay about $17.5 billion in foreign debts due this year.

John and Patsy Ramsey's home when their daughter's body was found, 
has resigned from the Boulder Police Department after 11 years. Ms. 
Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on Dec. 
26, 1996, after Mrs. Ramsey called 911 to report finding a 2 1/2-page 
ransom note. Court records said Ms. Arndt asked Ramsey to search 
the house for anything unusual. He went downstairs and emerged 
minutes later with the body of 6-year-old JonBenet, who had been 
beaten and strangled. No arrests have been made in the case, though 
the Ramseys remain suspects.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Below 10,000; Down 94.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average made its  
biggest move yet past 10,000, but fell back once again, unable to 
make its first close above that milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow made it all the way to 10,085.31 in early trading, and  
actually spent more than half the session trading above five 
digits. But weakness in technology stocks wiped out the Dow's 
gains, and it ended the day at 9,903.55, down 94.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. stock market indexes also closed lower.  
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 14.36 to 1,302.19, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 41.64 to 2,421.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
NYSE, with 1,830 down, 1,176 up and 547 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 911.40 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
831.04 million the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.93 to 610.68, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index declined 2.99 to 711.87. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.97 to 396.58.  
</P>
<P>
	Prices were also affected by the quarterly expiration of  
contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures, an 
event that typically exacerbates market volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow teased investors Thursday with a late bid at history,  
bobbing above 10,000 six separate times in the final 10 minutes of 
trading, only to creep back below and finish just 2.68 points 
beneath the vaunted milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the disappointment was another new high for the Dow,  
which rose 118.12 points for the day to close at a record 9,997.62. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also closed at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday  
morning, but pulled back after about a minute and closed with a 
loss. Thursday's high was 10,001.51, a shade below Tuesday's high 
of 10,001.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's last-minute flirtation with 10,000 sparked some  
confusion at the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
NYSE Chairman Richard A. Grasso and Dow Jones &AMP; Co. chief executive 
Peter Kann began celebrating too soon -- flinging baseball caps 
emblazoned with the words ``Dow 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 800 points, or nearly 9 percent, in 1999 --  
well on the way to what would be an unprecedented fifth straight 
year with a gain of at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While just a number, 10,000 would mark a crowning achievement  
for a resilient bull market that began more than eight years ago, 
on Oct. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has more than quadrupled since that time, driven by an  
extraordinary combination of positive factors, especially tame 
inflation, low interest rates, and a confident mood that has 
consumers buying everything from stocks to socks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main spark for Thursday's advance was a report that consumer  
prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month -- further confirmation 
that inflation remains in check and that the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing perception that the world's economic trouble spots are  
recovering has provided some extra fuel in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, investors were unfazed Thursday by a separate report  
from the Commerce Department showing that the nation's trade 
deficit shot up 21 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> Dollar off vs. yen on Japan stock rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Friday, falling against the  
yen on a rally in Japanese stocks but rising vs. the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen strengthened against the dollar after the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index jumped to an eight-month high, in part on 
optimism that Japan's economy may have hit bottom and is pulling 
out of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also sent the yen higher against the euro, which  
helped push the European common currency lower vs. the dollar as 
well. The euro also suffered from lingering worries about economic 
growth prospects in its participating countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was trading at 117.28  
Japanese yen, down from 117.45. The euro was quoted at $1.0892, 
down from $1.0970. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4657 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4575, and 1.5153 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5182. The British 
pound fell to $1.6287 from $1.6297. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7957 German 
marks, up from 1.7828; 6.0241 French francs, up from 5.9809; and 
1,776.20 Italian lire, up from 1,763.67

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones walked out  
of a hospital Friday, 13 days after a near-fatal traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 67, thanked Vanderbilt University Medical Center doctors  
and nurses before climbing aboard his tour bus for the ride home to 
the Nashville suburb of Franklin, hospital spokesman Wayne Wood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones lost control of his sport utility vehicle and crashed into  
a bridge while driving near his home March 6. His family said he 
was talking to his stepdaughter on a cellular phone at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who wasn't wearing a seat belt, suffered a punctured lung  
and lacerated liver, but no head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee Highway Patrol investigators have said inattentiveness  
and use of the phone were factors in the crash, but they are also 
examining whether alcohol was involved.

<HEADLINE> Report: Calif. GOP Is Falling Apart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- In a bluntly worded report, a  
Republican consultant says the California GOP is deteriorating as 
it clings to messages that are unappealing to the party's newest 
power groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The California Republican Party is no longer a competitive  
statewide party; at best it is a regional party,'' according to the 
report, ``The Emerging Republican Minority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was written by GOP consultant Bernd Schwieren, a  
researcher for the Assembly Republican Caucus. He declined to say 
who commissioned the study, a copy of which was obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``California is being transformed by major demographic, economic  
and cultural changes,'' the report says. ``They have led to the 
emergence of a new electorate whose most dynamic elements -- women, 
Latinos, new economy workers -- are the most hostile to the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result is that GOP influence has shrunk to scattered pockets  
around the state -- but does not include voter-rich Los Angeles and 
the San Francisco Bay area. Schwieren said that makes it difficult 
for the GOP to win elections; all but two Republican statewide 
candidates lost last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, based largely on recent information from exit polls  
commissioned by the Los Angeles Times and the Voter News Service, 
notes that Republican registration has dropped by more than 10 
percent this decade, to about one in three voters. And while there 
are more wealthy people in California, they voted more Democratic 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans here are still operating under strategies developed  
more than 30 years ago by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the 
report says, even though many of those messages are no longer 
viable. 
</P>
<P>
	Many voters now find the GOP's strategy ineffective and even  
offensive, the report says. More than half of last fall's voters 
held college degrees, which is part of the reason why ``GOP 
character/moral-based attacks failed in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These voters have a more tolerant view on social issues --  
abortion, gay rights, school prayer -- and are not receptive to a 
moralistic message,'' Schwieren writes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-page report describes an electorate that is less  
conservative than four years ago, less white and more tolerant of 
racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics and Asian Americans also are enjoying more clout in  
California politics, and the report says the GOP is losing its 
share of these groups -- as well as baby boomers, the largest 
demographic bloc in the California electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baby boomers tend to be hostile to what they perceive to be  
the narrow cultural message of the Republican Party. They view 
cultural diversity as a strength, not a weakness,'' Schwieren 
writes. ``And they are willing to vote against politicians running 
on platforms of cultural conformity.''

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Nuke Power Ambivalence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are more ambivalent about nuclear  
power than they were a decade ago, with fewer than half saying they 
support using atomic energy to produce electricity, according to an 
Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent say they believe nuclear plants are safer now, but  
half the respondents believe a serious nuclear accident is likely 
at a U.S. power plant. That number is unchanged from the 1989 AP 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest poll, taken 20 years after a serious accident at the  
Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., found 45 
percent of adults saying they support the use of nuclear energy. 
That is down 10 percentage points from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear power industry supplies about 20 percent of the  
nation's energy. No new plants are being built in this country and 
many existing facilities are seeking relicensing. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-in-three people surveyed said they oppose the use of  
nuclear power, while one-in-four said they didn't know. The 
percentage in opposition was the same a decade ago, but the number 
who said they didn't know where they stood on the issue was twice 
as high as it was in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Men were more likely than women to support nuclear power,  
according to the poll conducted by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think it will work,'' said 73-year-old Jim Bissey, a  
cashier from Springfield, Ohio. ``We have nuclear submarines and 
other nuclear devices that seem to work okay. I'm hoping that 
technology has moved forward so that whatever happened at Three 
Mile Island they can control or eliminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On March 28, 1979, a series of failures cut off the flow of  
cooling water to the reactor, which caused the top half of the 
reactor's radioactive core to collapse and melt. Contaminated 
coolant water escaped into a nearby building, releasing radioactive 
gases. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,015 people was taken Friday through  
Tuesday. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a majority of those who support the use of nuclear power  
said they wouldn't want to live within 10 miles of a plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen enough evidence to be anti-nuclear power,''  
said 33-year-old Kirsten Hoffman, a wife and mother from Corpus 
Christi, Tex. ``But it's the old NIMBY syndrome -- not in my back 
yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials say the 1990s are good times for nuclear  
power, even though no orders for new plants have been placed in 
more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Peterson, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute,  
said the industry has ``more than 100 nuclear power plants 
operating at record levels of efficiency and safety.'' He sees the 
environmental debate over pollution from coal and oil plants as a 
significant boost for nuclear power and believes that in another 
decade there may be an appetite for more large-scale plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The storage of radioactive waste continues to be an  
environmental concern, with almost half in the poll saying they 
believe it cannot be safely stored for many years. One-third said 
they thought it could be safely stored. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing nuclear plants may be able to compete economically  
with other types of plants in energy production costs, said Tom 
Cochran, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
But Cochran said the prohibitive cost of building new plants could 
reduce the amount of nuclear power in another couple of decades. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be fine with Dianne Carr, a 42-year-old Sharpsburg,  
Md., resident who vividly remembers news reports about the Three 
Mile Island accident in neighboring Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nuclear power is pretty scary,'' she said. ``I remember  
reading about evacuation plans for cities after Three Mile Island 
and it was mind-boggling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on nuclear power is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,015 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted March 
12-16 by ICR, of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Do you support or oppose using nuclear power to generate  
electricity? Support, 45 percent; oppose, 31 percent; don't know, 
23 percent; Refused to answer, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. (Asked only of the 493 respondents who support nuclear power)  
Would you support or oppose the construction of a nuclear power 
plant within 10 miles of your home? Support, 47 percent; oppose, 51 
percent; Don't know, 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Do you think nuclear power plants in the United States are  
safer now than they were 10 years ago, or not? Safer, 61 percent; 
not safer, 21 percent; don't know, 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Do you think radioactive waste from nuclear power plants can  
be safely stored for many years, or not? Yes, 31 percent; no, 47 
percent; don't know, 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. How would you rate the likelihood of a serious accident at a  
nuclear power plant in the United States -- highly likely, likely, 
unlikely or highly unlikely? Highly likely, 13 percent; likely 37 
percent; unlikely, 27 percent; highly unlikely, 18 percent; don't 
know, 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Last Sentra Rolls Off Line in Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- Thomas Palmer installed the front grille,  
popped open the trunk, checked to make sure lights, windows and 
windshield wipers worked, then drove the black Sentra off the 
assembly line Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen workers who had helped build No. 1,572,404  
cheered, clapped -- and a few fought back tears -- as they watched 
the completion of the last Sentra to be made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After 14 years of building the Sentra in Tennessee, Nissan Motor  
Co. is moving production to Aquacalientes, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little choked up,'' admitted Robbie Wentz, who has  
spent eight years working on the Sentra but is now training his 
co-workers to build the Xterra sport-utility vehicle, which begins 
production at the plant southeast of Nashville on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, it's a little sad,'' he said. ``But we're building  
up to the SUV. We're pumped!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican plant already had been producing about one-quarter  
of the Sentras sold in the United States. And Sentras are selling 
well in Mexico, while small car sales in this country continue 
dropping because of low gas prices and consumer interest in SUVs 
and other larger vehicles, said Dan Gaudette, vice president of 
marketing at the Smyrna plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to see it go, but it was the most practical thing to  
do,'' said Brent Rain, who helped build the engine that was dropped 
into the last Sentra. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Sentra was built in Smyrna in March 1985, a boxy,  
light blue car that still sits at the plant. Nissan also is likely 
to keep the last U.S.-built Sentra, Gaudette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also will begin making a four-door version of the  
Frontier pickup truck, with a shorter 4-foot bed and full backseat, 
on March 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels good,'' Palmer said after he got out of the Sentra  
and walked back toward the line to do the same job on another one 
of the trucks and Altimas that continued rolling through the plant. 
``I'm not sad at all. I'll be doing it with the SUV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Nissan officials in Tokyo were moving closer Friday  
to a deal with Renault to give Japan's No. 2 automaker an infusion 
of badly-needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The carmaker has lost money in five of the last six years,  
forecasts losing another $250 million this year and is likely to 
cut the number of model types.

<HEADLINE> Plymouth, Mercury May Be On Outs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The makers of Plymouth and Mercury insist they've  
made no plans to scrap their venerable marquees. Yet analysts say 
both car brands may be facing the proverbial end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Such speculation comes amid signs that DaimlerChrysler AG will  
jettison the Plymouth brand and that Ford Motor Co. is mulling a 
similar move for Mercury in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Mercury spokesman Jim Trainer: ``The reports of our  
demise are greatly exaggerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some things down the road,'' he said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Even so, both Plymouth and Mercury recently announced plans to  
discontinue selling most of their cars in Canada, fueling 
speculation that their days also are numbered in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest sign of their pending demise: a lack of new, unique  
models planned to replenish already thin product lines -- especially 
at Plymouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Plymouth and Mercury sell slightly different versions of  
cars already sold by their bigger sister divisions. As marketing 
costs increase, the industry is moving away from the costly and 
often counterproductive practice of trying to market the same car 
under two different brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to stop throwing money at brands that can't be  
resurrected,'' said analyst George Peterson of AutoPacific Inc., an 
industry consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Plymouth is getting a redesigned 2000 Neon, a subcompact sold in  
larger numbers by Dodge dealers. The only other mass-market 
Plymouth car, the compact Breeze, also is a Dodge twin and 
production analysts say it won't be replaced with the next 
generation. Only the limited-production Prowler hot rod is unique. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a done deal,'' Peterson said. ``What  
DaimlerChrysler is doing with Plymouth is like what it did with the 
Eagle brand: not renewing the product line and just letting it fade 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Mercury, the only unique products are the new Cougar that  
already is sold as a Ford overseas and the Villager minivan, a 
version of which is sold as the Quest by Japan's Nissan. All other 
Mercurys are Ford twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury also recently ceased production of its subcompact  
Tracer. The Mystique compact is expected to end in the 2000 model 
year, and analysts expect the Villager to be axed in a few years 
when Ford gives a new minivan to newly acquired Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	Plymouth dates to 1928 when the former Chrysler Corp. introduced  
the four-cylinder car with the six-cylinder DeSoto. Lincoln 
introduced the Mercury in 1938; Edsel Ford chose the name. 
</P>
<P>
	What may slow down the brands' demise are their most popular  
models: the Plymouth Voyager minivan and the Mercury Grand Marquis, 
a full-size sedan. Dealers may be unwilling to give them up without 
a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name is strong and you don't want to lose that,'' said Wes  
Brown, an analyst with Nextrend.

<HEADLINE> Lehman Bros. Profit Up 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. reported a 13  
percent jump in first-quarter profits, beating Wall Street's 
expectations, as the company made money trading stocks and bonds 
while reigning in expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman earned $211 million, or $1.57 a share, for the quarter  
ended Feb. 28, handily surpassing analysts' average estimate of 
$1.47 a share. In the year-ago period, Lehman earned $187 million, 
or $1.44 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``Across the board, our businesses performed well, with fixed  
income and equities posting particularly strong results,'' Richard 
S. Fuld Jr., Lehman's chairman and chief executive, said Friday in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues for the most recent quarter were $1.12 billion, up  
7 percent from $1.05 billion in the first quarter 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company underwrote three high-profile  
Internet stock offerings in February -- VerticleNet, Pacific 
Internet and Tut Systems -- which also helped improve the bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The second quarter is also showing signs of strength. Lehman  
already has $10 billion in stock offerings in its underwriting 
pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	Controlling costs also paid off in the first quarter.  
Non-interest expenses rose 5 percent, but excluding 
personnel-related costs, they were flat, despite continued 
investments in several divisions and increased technology 
expenditures to related to the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Lehman's strong results, its stock fell $2.93 3/4 to  
$59.31 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Quits After 27 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- After coaching Tara Lipinski to a  
gold medal and Todd Eldredge to five national titles and a world 
championship, Richard Callaghan is calling it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, one of the premier skating coaches in the United  
States, will retire this spring after 27 years in coaching. He 
resigned as director of skating at the Detroit Skating Club earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan was on his way to the World Figure Skating  
Championships in Helsinki, Finland, on Friday, and could not be 
reached for comment by The Associated Press. He's coaching U.S. 
bronze medalist Angela Nikodinov in the world championships, which 
begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I was shocked when I found out,'' Eldredge,  
who's worked with Callaghan for 17 years, told the Detroit Free 
Press. ``I don't know if he wants to do some things or go into 
something else. There's been a lot of different tensions and stuff 
going on -- I don't want to talk about it -- but I think he wants to 
move away from the tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, there have been only four years in which Callaghan  
didn't have one of the top three skaters in either the men's or 
women's singles in the U.S. national championships. His skaters 
have won one Olympic gold medal, seven national titles, two world 
crowns and five other medals in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nicole Bobek and Eldredge won national titles in 1995, he  
became the first coach in 45 years to train the men's and ladies' 
champions in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Callaghan, Lipinski went from 15th in the 1996 world  
championships to being the youngest-ever U.S. and world champion a 
year later. She added the gold medal at Nagano in 1998, upsetting 
heavily favored Michelle Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipinski gave up her Olympic eligibility last spring, and left  
Callaghan soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan's most enduring partnership was with Eldredge, who  
began training with him as a 10-year-old. He followed Callaghan 
from Philadelphia to Colorado Springs, San Diego and finally 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning national titles in 1990 and 1991, injury and  
illness nearly derailed Eldredge's career. But he came back to win 
three more U.S. titles and the 1996 world crown.

<HEADLINE> Missing Sightseers' Car Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BARN, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities trying to find three women  
who vanished last month after a visit to Yosemite National Park 
have found another grim clue: a rental car, charred and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is positive the three were victims of a violent crime.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously this is one of the key pieces of evidence we've been  
looking for,'' FBI Agent James Maddock said Thursday. ``Hopefully 
this is going to take us a long way down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Julie, 15, and Silvina Pelosso,  
16, a family friend from Cordoba, Argentina, were last seen at the 
Cedar Lodge near Yosemite Park on Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock said the three were most likely the victims of a  
kidnapping or a carjacking late that day or early Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	No victims were found in the car, which was located about 100  
yards off a highway northeast of the Sierra Nevada Gold Rush town 
of Sonora, nearly three hours away on winding roads from the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever left the car knew the area, Maddock said.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an area someone would have just stumbled across,''  
he said, noting the car was well hidden off a road in an area often 
used by locals as a dumping ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund's wallet was found Feb. 19 in Modesto, a two-hour  
drive to the east, also down winding, narrow roads. They rental 
car, a 1999 red Pontiac Grand Prix, was identified by its license 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sund is a member of the prominent Carrington family, which  
made millions in Northern California real estate and now mostly 
lives in Eureka. The family has offered a $300,000 reward for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Carrington, Mrs. Sund's father, said the family is still  
hoping the women are alive, perhaps being held hostage somewhere. 
However, the discovery of the car brought some relief. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Man Acquitted of Four Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A man who claimed self-defense for gunning down  
four unarmed people in their parked car after one of them pounded 
on his door in the middle of the night and hit him was acquitted of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Narit Burin ``Archie'' Bunchien, 22, chased the visitor 70 feet  
down his driveway and pumped four to seven bullets into each of the 
victims, including a 15-year-old girl, outside his home in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they had no reason to doubt that Bunchien  
feared for his life. But they contended his behavior was not 
self-defense because of the number of victims and the nature of 
their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a jury cleared Bunchien.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, An Phong Ngoc ``Nick'' Nguyen, 21, had come  
pounding on Bunchien's door at 3 a.m., demanding that he apologize 
for jokingly calling the girl a prostitute weeks earlier, according 
to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunchien said he agreed to apologize but that Nguyen hit him in  
the head anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunchien pulled a pistol and chased Nguyen. Nguyen called to the  
girl, who remained in the car, to get a gun, according to Bunchien. 
Two young men who had gotten out of the car jumped back in, and 
Nguyen followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bunchien emptied his pistol into the four. None was armed, and  
no weapon was found in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury foreman was quoted anonymously by the Houston Chronicle  
as saying he agreed with defense attorney Dick DeGuerin that 
anybody who pounds on someone's door at 3 a.m. is ``up to no 
good.''

<HEADLINE> Bosox' Garciaparra Has Arm Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra said Friday that he  
has had ``sharp pain'' in his arm that has limited his ability to 
throw a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, the Boston Red Sox shortstop and runner-up in the  
AL MVP race last year, injured a tendon in his right biceps last 
Thursday against Toronto. He has been limited to designated hitter 
duty since then with what the Red Sox called tendinitis in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to a player of his caliber we tend to be  
cautious on how we handle these things,'' manager Jimy Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who hadn't thrown a baseball for nine days, was  
``encouraged'' by a light catch he had at a workout Friday, 
according to team spokesman Kevin Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra denied reports in Friday's Boston Herald that he is  
considering flying back to his home in California to get a second 
opinion on the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has not crossed my mind yet,'' said Garciaparra, who did  
not travel with the Red Sox to Sarasota on Friday for their game 
against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said ``that's a matter we are handling in-house and  
considering today's players I wouldn't be surprised if that 
occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes to a Boston camp that is still dealing with  
injuries to second baseman Jeff Frye, first baseman Reggie 
Jefferson and outfielder Midre Cummings. Frye has a ribcage and 
groin injury and is expected to make his spring training debut 
Saturday while Cummings is day-to-day with an injured hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams announced earlier this week that Jefferson, healing  
from an injured back, will not be ready for the start of the 
season.

<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Eye Final Four -- Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- When talking about women's basketball at  
Tennessee, get the numbers right. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamique Holdsclaw was asked Friday about the possibility of a  
third straight national title. The All-American shot back with a 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, I would be winning my fourth,'' she said. ``I've won  
three already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, top-seeded Tennessee (30-2) is deep into the NCAA  
tournament, primed for its 12th Final Four trip since 1982 and 
fifth title of the 1990s. The next step is the East Regional 
semifinals Saturday against Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're at the top of our game -- Tennessee wins,'' coach Pat  
Summitt said when asked about the possibility of a Virginia Tech 
(28-2) upset Saturday. ``If we bring our `A' game then we're going 
to be a hard team to beat in March.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech coach Bonnie Henrickson has built a solid program  
in her two seasons in Blacksburg, Va., including a school-record 
28-2 mark this season, but nothing to compare to Tennessee's 
dominance and Summitt's 694 career wins. 
</P>
<P>
	And Henrickson didn't hide the fact -- in front of three of her  
best players -- that the Lady Volunteers are more talented at every 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that we have to play a perfect game, there is no  
such thing,'' Henrickson said. ``We've got to limit our mistakes. 
It's how we respond. Do we still have poise and composure to do the 
little things and stay together? 
</P>
<P>
	``This team all year has had great confidence in each other.  
They realize that 1-on-1 we're overmatched at each position, but we 
haven't let it go 1-on-1 all year, we don't play that way. We rely 
on each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The health of Tennessee guard Semeka Randall remains  
questionable. She damaged a ligament in her left ankle in the first 
round and missed her team's 89-62 second-round victory over Boston 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	``If practice is any indication, I think she'll be available,''  
Summitt said of Randall, who averages 14.1 points and 5.1 rebounds 
a game. ``She plays at one speed -- all out. I had to tell her to 
slow down in ballhandling drills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, minutes later, Summitt backed off her comments and said  
she may wait until halftime before deciding on whether to use 
Randall. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's first semifinal, Duke (26-6) takes on Old Dominion  
(28-3). 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils won the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season  
with a 15-1 record. The Lady Monarchs are one of the game's storied 
women's programs, having won eight straight Colonial Athletic 
Association crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion is a deep team with interchangeable parts that  
pressured its first two NCAA opponents into 62 combined turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name of the game is not necessarily going to be scoring,  
but taking care of the ball to allow us to score,'' Duke coach Gail 
Goestenkors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Monarchs are riding a 17-game winning streak, last  
losing on Jan. 19 to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Dominion's fine season has come despite losing All-Americans  
Ticha Penicheiro and Nyree Roberts to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``After last season we heard how the era had ended,'' coach  
Wendy Larry said. ``As a coach and as a player when you hear that 
over and over again you can get very inspired. Thank goodness for 
our inspiration.''

<HEADLINE> Martin Gets Record Sixth Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Mark Martin, the dominant Busch Grand  
National driver at Darlington, won his record sixth pole Friday in 
qualifying for the Diamond Hill Plywood 200. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned a fast lap of 166.568 mph to start Saturday's race up  
front and lead a group of Winston Cup drivers doubling up this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``That car seemed to be pretty fast in practice, but it didn't  
feel fast,'' Martin said. ``I thought I needed to be going faster 
than I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Burton, Martin's Roush Racing teammate, was second at  
165.889. Dick Trickle, who won the Dura-Lube 200 at Darlington in 
September, was third at 165.883. Geoffrey Bodine came next at 
165.494 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. was the first Busch  
regular to make it in, taking fifth at 165.181 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin has an early hold on the driver points race after winning  
at Las Vegas earlier this month. He also has the most Busch wins at 
Darlington (5), led the most laps (735) and finished in the most 
top 10s (13). 
</P>
<P>
	Martin held the groove on a mild South Carolina day, while other  
racers had trouble making it around the fickle, 1.366-mile layout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, a Darlington winner in 1998, broke the tip off  
his right shoulder blade during practice three hours before 
qualifying and withdrew. He sheared the tip off his left shoulder 
in a 1995 Darlington crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, I've got a pair that match,'' he said after returning  
from the hospital in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt McLaughlin, who took the pole for Darlington's Dura-Lube  
200 this past September, smacked the wall in Turns 3-4 and needed a 
provisional to make the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Martin tagged the stone barrier in Turn 4 as he tried to  
squeeze a few more drops of speed out of his Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to go for any time without doing something stupid,''  
he said. Martin said the damage wasn't anything his crew couldn't 
fix before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-qualifiers Mark Krough and Jeff Finley also touched  
Darlington's tricky oval sides during runs. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Fords of Martin and Burton, Chevrolets took the next  
nine spots. Kevin Lepage was sixth, followed by Jeff Fuller, Todd 
Bodine, Matt Kenseth and Randy LaJoie. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Winston Cup racers in the 42-car Busch field include Terry  
Labonte (13th), Michael Waltrip (14th), points leader Mike Skinner 
(15th) and Joe Nemechek (18th). 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has almost matched Martin for dominance at Darlignton -- a  
Busch victory in the 1997 Dura-Lube and five top-10 finishes in 13 
career races. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides last year's victory, Trickle has had seven top-five  
finishes in eight Busch events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darlington is kind of known as a driver's track,'' Trickle  
said. ``Anybody who runs well (here) thinks they've accomplished 
something.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Off Vs. Yen on Japan Stock Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Friday, falling against the  
yen on a rally in Japanese stocks but rising vs. the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen strengthened against the dollar after the Tokyo Stock  
Exchange's main index jumped to an eight-month high, in part on 
optimism that Japan's economy may have hit bottom and is pulling 
out of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally also sent the yen higher against the euro, which  
helped push the European common currency lower vs. the dollar as 
well. The euro also suffered from lingering worries about economic 
growth prospects in its participating countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was trading at 117.28  
Japanese yen, down from 117.45. The euro was quoted at $1.0892, 
down from $1.0970. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4657 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4575, and 1.5153 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5182. The British 
pound fell to $1.6287 from $1.6297. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7957 German 
marks, up from 1.7828; 6.0241 French francs, up from 5.9809; and 
1,776.20 Italian lire, up from 1,763.67

<HEADLINE> Ford Hires Ex-BMW Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Former BMW AG product development chief Wolfgang  
Reitzle was named Friday to oversee the luxury divisions of Ford 
Motor Co., including Britain's Jaguar Cars Ltd. and the recently 
acquired Volvo Cars of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle's appointment had been expected for more than a month,  
virtually since he resigned in a management shakeup at BMW that 
also resulted in Chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder's ouster. Reitzle 
had been considered Pischetsrieder's heir apparent at the German 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ford, the highly respected Reitzle will be based in London as  
group vice president of the newly created premier automotive group. 
He becomes chairman of Jaguar and Volvo and will oversee Aston 
Martin and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of new President Jac Nasser's campaign to bring  
more outside executive talent to Ford as it tries to strengthen its 
No. 2 position worldwide and challenge the leadership of General 
Motors Corp. Like the other U.S.-based auto companies, Ford 
traditionally has promoted from within. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Volkswagen AG also reportedly had sought to hire Reitzle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Reitzle's worldwide experience in the premium segment and his  
appreciation of classic marques makes him a highly appropriate 
addition to our senior management team,'' Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, Nick  
Scheele, was appointed senior vice president of Ford of Europe with 
responsibility for marketing, sales and service. Scheele was 
credited with turning the troubled British automaker around since 
he assumed the job in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle, 50, headed markets and product development for BMW, a  
maker of high-performance sports and luxury cars. He is credited 
with bringing many of BMW's most successful products to market. He 
also oversaw the development of the new X5 sport utility vehicle, 
which will be produced in South Carolina and go on sale later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute that led to his departure was over Pischetsrieder's  
strategy for turning around its money-losing Rover car unit in 
Britain. Ford's news release announcing Reitzle's appointment made 
no mention of BMW, where the executive had worked for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Reitzle will report directly to Nasser. He and Scheele also were  
named officers of the company.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average made its  
biggest move yet past 10,000, but fell back once again, unable to 
make its first close above that milestone. The Dow made it all the 
way to 10,085.31 in early trading, and actually spent more than 
half the session trading above five digits. But weakness in 
technology stocks wiped out the Dow's gains, and it ended the day 
at 9,903.55, down 94.07. Other U.S. stock market indexes also 
closed lower. Technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 41.64 to 
2,421.32. Prices were also affected by the quarterly expiration of 
contracts on stock options, index options, and index futures, an 
event that typically exacerbates market volatility.

30 percent of the software pioneer's workforce, or 750 employees. 
And the cuts could come as soon as next week, TheStreet.com online

that determined how much the nation's Bell companies, GTE and other

to compete against the major local phone companies need to install 
equipment in those offices in order to provide their own phone or

change of course forced by a rival offer for the Italian fashion 
house. LVMH's bid came after Gucci agreed earlier in the day to 
sell a 40 percent stake to French retailer 
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute for $2.9 billion. LVMH said if Gucci 
scraps that deal, it will offer more than the $75 per share offered 
by Pinault-Printemps. But LVMH declined to reveal the price. 
Financial analysts, howver, estimated the offer is about $80 a

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends Gore about Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton defended Vice President Al  
Gore's claims that he helped create the Internet -- but didn't get 
it quite right himself today as he described the explosive growth 
of the worldwide computer network since his election. 
</P>
<P>
	The president defended Gore as ``one of the major architects of  
America's progress in technology'' and said he ``deserves a lot of 
appreciation for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton also appeared to undercount by almost 5,000 times  
the size of the Internet when he was first elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep in mind, I think when I became president in 1993 there  
were still only 50 or 60 sites on the Internet, and now there are 
millions and millions,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, by July of 1993 the computer network actually had  
26,000 total sites, called ``domains'' -- each with a unique 
Internet address, according to figures from the Commerce 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sites, however, weren't like the World Wide Web sites that  
most computer-users now browse with just a simple point and click. 
Instead, those earlier sites required arcane keyboard commands to 
navigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Wide Web was in its earliest stages in 1993. But  
Clinton failed to distinguish in his comments that he was referring 
only to the Web portion of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Familiar Web sites didn't come into widespread use until 1994,  
although most experts estimate there were roughly 130 such Web 
sites by mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest browser to be widely used by consumers, Netscape's  
Mosaic software, emerged in late 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The company responsible for Internet addresses ending in  
``com,'' ``net'' and ``org'' recently announced it had registered 4 
million such sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore drew criticism from Republicans when he said last week that  
during his time in Congress he ``took the initiative in creating 
the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas called it an  
``outrageous claim,'' noting that the Internet developed from a 
research network originally constructed in 1969 -- long before Gore 
was elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stood by his running mate.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, you know, he came a lot closer to inventing the Internet  
than I did,'' the president said.

	Hastert Calls Kosovo Crisis `Grave'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the United  
States is on the ``brink of a very grave situation'' after meeting 
with President Clinton regarding the breakdown of peace talks for 
Kosovo. With Clinton suggesting NATO action against Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic may be close, the State Department 
began evacuating the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and the Pentagon sent 
more warplanes to the region. ``Our allies are strongly united 
behind this course,'' Clinton said. '' ... Make no mistake: If we 
and our allies do not ... act, there will be more massacres.''

	Libya To Turn Over Bomb Suspects

	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Two men wanted for trial on charges of  
blowing up a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland in 1988 will be turned 
over by Libya on April 6. Libya has promised in a letter to the 
United Nations to make the suspects available for custody before 
their trial in the Netherlands. The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killed 270 people. The United Nations 
imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 for refusing to hand over the 
two men for trial.

Israel uses force to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. 
Arafat said he has won assurances from the several nonaligned 
nations and Arab states that they will recognize a Palestinian 
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian leader 
initially said he would declare statehood on May 4. However, the 
United States, Egypt, Jordan and the European Community have asked

<HEADLINE> Big Companies Aim To Deter Shoplifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Security tags have long been used to stop  
shoplifters before they get out the door with expensive stolen 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three consumer products makers would like to develop a global  
standard for alarm-triggering tags to stop thefts of less expensive 
packaged items like packages of film, nonprescription medicine and 
cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak Co., Johnson and Johnson and Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.  
are trying to build a consensus for standards that could be applied 
to reduce retail theft, which is estimated at up to $16 billion a 
year in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
	At that level, shoplifting amounts to roughly $60 for every man,  
woman and child in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	If the standards are embraced widely, officials say  
manufacturers could routinely include the tags as they package 
products. Retailers would save the time and expense of manual 
tagging. And consumers would pay lower prices and may get easier 
access to products now kept out of reach so they won't be stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The tags could also be helpful in assuring that packaged  
products are authentic and not cheap imitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak, J&AMP;J and Procter said Thursday they are forming an  
alliance called the Consumer Products Manufacturers' Consortium and 
are committing an undisclosed amount to developing a security tag 
standard by mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the three companies, who are among the world's  
biggest manufacturers of packaged goods, said there is no reason 
that manufacturers and retailers cannot agree on a security 
standard as they have on bar codes for pricing information and 
energy-efficiency ratings for appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	They said less than a third of packaged products carry a  
security tag today. In addition, they said there are multiple 
incompatible security tag systems on the market that add to costs 
for manufacturers and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastman Kodak, the photographic products company based in  
Rochester, N.Y., has been looking into the issue for about two 
years and recently approached the other two companies about teaming 
up to be the catalyst for industry development discussion about 
developing the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson is a drugmaker based in New Brunswick, N.J.,  
and Procter &AMP; Gamble is a food and household products conglomerate 
based in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has hired NovaVision Inc., a privately held company  
that makes holograms and other anti-counterfeiting marks, to advise 
it in developing the standards. Eastman Kodak has worked previously 
with the 5-year-old company from Bowling Green, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Kellam, Procter &AMP; Gamble's representative on  
manufacturers' alliance, said NovaVision would be eligible to make 
security tags once the standards are established but he said other 
companies would also make tags based on the specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Wasilov, a Kodak executive, said the group hopes that  
news of its search will prompt outsiders to share their ideas about 
what will work.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Speech Stock Now Worth $14M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whoever said talk is cheap hadn't heard about  
the stock that former President Bush is said to have accepted for 
addressing an audience in Tokyo last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the former  
president agreed to take shares in Global Crossing Ltd. in lieu of 
$80,000 in cash for speaking to a group assembled by the 
telecommunications startup business. The newspaper said the stock 
is now worth about $14.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush normally gets $100,000 for an overseas speech, the Journal  
said, but gave a 20 percent discount to Global Crossing whose 
co-chairman was an old friend, Lodwrick M. Cook, former chief 
executive of Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the day after the speech, Bush expressed  
curiosity about the company over breakfast with Cook and Global 
Crossing's other co-chairman, Gary Winnick. 
</P>
<P>
	Winnick reportedly suggested that Bush take his fee in stock in  
their privately held firm instead of cash, and Bush agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing went public in August, and its stock price has  
jumped fivefold. Earlier this week, the Bermuda-based company 
agreed to buy Frontier Corp., the phone company based in Rochester, 
N.Y., for $11.2 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper attributed the report on Bush to people close to  
the situation. The sources were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Bush, Michael Dannenhauer, confirmed Friday that  
the former president made the speech in February 1998 for Global 
Crossing but declined to say how he was paid. ``We are not 
commenting on that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Good Times Bypass Midsized Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Forget the soaring stock market, surging  
national economy and federal surplus. For places like this gritty 
old steel town, all the good national economic news is something 
happening somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large cities are doing well, but we have an entire class of  
midsized cities that are really struggling,'' HUD Secretary Andrew 
Cuomo said on a visit to Gary last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing tells that story better than the once-brawny business  
district known as Broadway, which was Gary's commercial and social 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if a parcel of land isn't vacant, it's home to a shuttered  
business. And if a business is open, it's likely a liquor store, 
check-cashing outlet or pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo, the nation's chief advocate for cities as head of the  
Department of Housing and Urban Development, shook his head and 
sighed at the sight as he headed toward City Hall, adjacent to a 
closed and rusting Sheraton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary has to figure out where it is going to fit in the new  
economy,'' he said glumly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average dallied with 10,000 this week.  
More Americans, 69.1 million families, own their homes than at any 
time in history. After years in the red, the government is posting 
budget surpluses. But the robust economy has been a bust for Gary, 
where 40 percent of residents fall below the federal poverty rate 
of $16,655 in annual income for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary isn't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Ana, Calif., defense industry cutbacks have slowed the  
local economy. In Chester, Pa., a decline in shipbuilding has 
caused problems. In Flint, Mich., the closing of auto production 
facilities is the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo said most of the struggling cities are in the Northeast,  
but Sun Belt cities that have lost textile mills to overseas 
competition or military bases to federal belt-tightening aren't 
immune to the hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cities are rooted in older manufacturing economies,''  
Cuomo said. ``They need to be retrofitted for a new economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That retrofit comes with a pair of dice and a roulette wheel in  
Gary. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say some modicum of recovery has come from two casino  
boats, moored to a walkway in Lake Michigan, that opened three 
years ago. Melvin Thornton, 45, a Gary bank teller, said they have 
brought visitors and a measure of optimism for locals, but more is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boats are nice, but a lot of the people gambling are from  
around here and don't really have that much money to spend,'' 
Thornton said. ``Nothing's going to change until they fix downtown. 
It's a ghost town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Komechak, 34, a Southern California transplant who works in  
an African arts store, said she was shocked to find Gary's lack of 
development Gary, especially considering it's less than an hour's 
drive from bustling Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This city should be a major crossroads with everything  
happening in Chicago,'' said Komechak, a Gary resident since 1992. 
``People say once the mills closed, apathy set in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little national media attention has been focused on small  
cities' predicament, in part because the media capitals of New York 
and Los Angeles have done so well. New York City, for example, is 
experiencing a financial renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York has the stock market, and Los Angeles has the picture  
industry, so they are anomalies,'' Cuomo says. ``The rest of the 
nation can't be judged by how well they are doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even cities such as Cleveland and Baltimore, which won  
reputations for renewal in the 1990s, have pronounced problems, 
said William Barnes, an urban analyst for the National League of 
Cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Go to west-side communities in Cleveland, Barnes said, and folks  
are still asking: ``What new economy? I'm hurting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has responded by creating special  
inner-city economic zones, sending millions of dollars in federal 
grants and tax benefits to troubled cities competing for them 
through a competitive application process. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary and neighboring East Chicago, Ind., were among 15  
communities that won enterprise zone designations last year, but 
115 cities applied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each city has to figure out why people and business will want  
to move there,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Good Outweighs Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five weeks after surviving impeachment,  
President Clinton said today the record will show ``one negative'' 
when he lied but hundreds and hundreds of other times ``when I did 
not abuse my authority as president, that I was truthful with the 
American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a post-mortem on a scandal-scarred year, the president also  
said he and his wife Hillary are still working on repairing their 
relationship and that, ``We love each other very much.'' He said he 
had not a clue whether she would run for a U.S. Senate seat -- but 
pointedly added that the first lady had suggested they move to New 
York when he leaves the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with reporters at his first full-scale White House  
news conference in nearly a year, answering questions that largely 
focused on suspected Chinese nuclear espionage and the threat of 
airstrikes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO must be prepared to carry out airstrikes against  
Serbs because ``hesitation is a license to kill.'' He said the 
Serbs already had crossed the threshold that warrants military 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The president defended his administration's handling of China's  
suspected theft of secrets from U.S. nuclear labs in the 1980s. He 
also said, ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything 
to me about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the 
labs during my presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was asked about impeachment, the loyalty of former  
aides who have written tell-all books and allegations that he 
sexually assaulted an Arkansas woman 21 years ago when he was the 
state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney has denied the assault allegation, and Clinton  
said, ``He speaks for me. I think he spoke quite clearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton refused to discuss his personal reflections about his  
bitterly partisan impeachment ordeal or comment on whether he feels 
resentment or relief. ``It's best for me not to focus on that now. 
I think it's best for me to focus on my job. I have nearly two 
years to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a questioner pinned him down about ``what your legacy will  
be about lying'' and the importance of telling the truth. After 
initially denying that he had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, 
Clinton last year acknowledged that they had a sexual relationship 
and that he had lied about it. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the lesson for young people will be that even  
presidents have to tell the truth and there are consequences when 
they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I also think that there will be a box score,'' Clinton  
said, ``and there will be that one negative and then there will be 
the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times when the record 
will show that I did not abuse my authority as president, that I 
was truthful with the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further, he said that ``scores and scores of allegations were  
made against me and widely publicized without any regard to whether 
they were true or not. Most of them have already been actually 
proved false. And it's very hard to disprove every false allegation 
against you but we have had more success, frankly, than I was 
afraid we would when we started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton chuckled when a reporter asked why people ``have been so  
mean to you. Is it a conspiracy, is it a plan?'' He said that 
despite all his troubles, ``I have been very blessed in my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to criticized former senior adviser George  
Stephanopoulos, now a television commentator, and former political 
adviser Dick Morris for writing books that reveal insider secrets 
and their personal feelings about Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't read either of the books or even any articles about  
it,'' he said. But he said he valued the loyalty and service he has 
received ``from the overwhelming majority'' of people who have 
worked for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The president reserved special praise for Vice President Al  
Gore, tweaked by Republicans for his claims that he invented the 
Internet and spent his boyhood plowing hills in Tennessee. Clinton 
said it's a challenge for any politician to promote himself without 
overdoing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be happy to toot his horn ... because there's no question  
that he has been integral to all the good things that have happened 
in this administration,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	On other personnel matters, Clinton said he has not talked with  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about whether to reappoint 
him to another term. Be he cautioned that no one should draw any 
conclusions from that. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he has not talked with Treasury Secretary  
Robert Rubin about his future, although rumors that Rubin is about 
to leave shake Wall Street from time to time. ``I hope he will stay 
... But I do not know what his specific plans are,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On another subject, Clinton said he hopes Russia can reach an  
agreement with the International Monetary Fund for billions of 
dollars in bailout funds. But he expressed concern that money 
already sent to Russia has been siphoned off improperly. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said international relief ``will only work if the  
money doesn't turn around and leave the country as soon as it's put 
in.''

<HEADLINE> Rubin Says Loans to Russia Correct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said today the  
International Monetary Fund made the right decision last summer in 
providing emergency loans to Russia even if part of the money ended 
up in foreign bank accounts held by rich Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a conference on how the news media cover financial  
matters, Rubin sought to clarify remarks he made to Congress on 
Thursday in which he seemed to indicate that much of the $4.8 
billion in loans ``may have been siphoned off improperly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My point was not to suggest that anything improper happened,''  
Rubin said. He said he was simply trying to describe the pressures 
that exist when frightened investors are trying to sell off their 
holdings and flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In the type of crisis that Russia was experiencing last summer,  
the IMF emergency loans are designed to bolster confidence and halt 
the capital flight by reassuring investors that the government has 
enough in financial resources to support its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the case of Russia, the emergency bailout did not work.  
The $4.8 billion was used by the Russian central bank to intervene 
in the chaotic financial markets by buy up rubles that nervous 
investors were selling. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF critics have charged that the $4.8 billion were wasted and  
the IMF resources simply flowed into the hands of wealthy Russians 
who were selling rubles for dollars and other currencies which they 
transferred to Switzerland and other safe havens. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he had no way of knowing how much of the IMF  
resources were used in that way. But he said the IMF rescue failed 
not because of the actions of wealthy investors but the lack of 
approval by the Russian parliament of the economic reforms needed 
to restore confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	While saying the IMF made the right decision in extending the  
loans last summer on the expectation that the Russian parliament 
pass the economic reform package, Rubin stopped short of saying 
whether Russia should now get the next installment of the $22.1 
billion in emergency support assembled by the IMF last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov plans to visit  
Washington next week, and his government hopes to complete 
negotiations with the IMF at that time for new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the rest of the world has a tremendous stake in the  
.. financial success of Russia,'' Rubin said. But he stressed that 
it would be up to the IMF to decide whether Russia had made enough 
progress in stabilizing its economy to receive more support from 
the lending agency. 
</P>
<P>
	On a separate subject on whether he was considering leaving the  
administration soon, Rubin gave his standard reply that he remained 
focused ``on the issues in front of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about Rubin's possible departure reappeared in financial  
markets on Friday. Wall Street investors give Rubin a great deal of 
credit for the economic prosperity the country is now enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the rumors at a news conference Friday, President  
Clinton said he had not talked with Rubin about his future plans 
``in quite a long while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has served well. I hope he will stay,'' Clinton said. ``I  
am aware of all the rumors, but we have not had a conversation 
about them.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Firms Cut Capital Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese companies plan to slash their  
capital investment by 5.3 percent in the next fiscal year, marking 
the third consecutive year of decline, a government-run bank survey 
showed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined capital spending by manufacturing and non-manufacturing  
companies is projected at 26.23 trillion yen ($224.2 billion) for 
the new fiscal year beginning April 1, the Japan Development Bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are hardly any bright factors in sight, especially in  
the manufacturing sector,'' said Masahiko Komori, deputy director 
of the bank's Economics and Industrial Research Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The planned cuts come just as the government has been touting  
the view that Japan's recession-hit economy may be about to start 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Economic Planning Agency said in its recent monthly report  
that the nation's economy was gradually bottoming out, citing some 
signs of improvement in spending for housing. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Japan's Parliament enacted a $693.7 billion  
national budget for fiscal 1999, including $80.6 billion in new 
public works, to bail the nation's economy out of its worst 
recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Komori said it will be the first time since 1971 that capital  
spending at major Japanese manufacturers is projected to fall in 
all 14 industrial categories surveyed. Aggregate spending by the 
manufacturing companies is expected to fall a substantial 10.1 
percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers, which had increased capital investment for four  
consecutive years through 1998, plan to cut it by 4.2 percent. 
Spending by steel makers is projected to fall by 17.8 percent in 
the new fiscal year through March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were made after the Japan Development Bank  
conducted a survey on Feb. 20, covering 2,791 major companies 
across Japan, with capital of $8.5 million or more, Komori said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the current fiscal year ending March 31, combined capital  
investment of all industries is predicted to decline 3.5 percent, 
the government-financed bank said.

	RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. (AP) -- A Los Angeles County court  
commissioner was gunned down as he pulled his Mercedes-Benz into 
his driveway. His wife also was found fatally shot on the garage 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	H. George Taylor, 68, was killed in the car Thursday, which  
crashed into the garage of his home in this affluent neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies said Friday no arrests  
had been made and a motive for the slayings was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Waggoner, a neighbor, said he ran to the Taylor house  
after hearing about five shots. Deputies said they got several 911 
calls reporting gunshots just before 10 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies said Taylor and his wife, identified by neighbors as  
Lynda, were dead when they arrived at the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor became a commissioner in March 1986. Court commissioners  
hear divorce, custody and estate cases, as judges do. The 
difference is that commissioners are hired by the court and preside 
over a case only if all parties agree to the arrangement.

<HEADLINE> More evidence for life in meteorites? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The same NASA team that says it found microbial  
life in a Martian meteor now claim two other meteors contain 
similar fossilized remnants. 
</P>
<P>
	What appear to be bacteria are contained in two meteorites  
believed to be from Mars, according to a team led by Johnson Space 
Center geologist David S. McKay, who presented his findings 
Thursday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA team's latest findings, made within the past six  
months, were from samples of a 1.3 billion-year-old meteorite that 
fell to Earth in 1911 near Nakhla, Egypt, and a 165 
million-year-old meteorite that fell near Shergotty, India, in 
1865. 
</P>
<P>
	``My own opinion is that these will turn out to be true  
micro-fossils from Mars,'' McKay said. ``We're not counting on 
getting many converts. All we ask, though, is that people keep an 
open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist was one of the researchers who in August 1996  
announced the discovery of tiny fossilized structures in crevices 
of a 4 billion-year-old Mars meteorite found in the Allan Hills 
region of Antarctica in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three years, rival researchers and other scientists  
have debated the significance of the NASA team's earlier findings 
from Mars. Independent analyses of the Mars rock have failed to 
yield absolute evidence that the potato-sized chunk ever contained 
life.

<HEADLINE> SJU's Barkley Mum on Dad's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Erick Barkley will talk at length about  
guarding Ohio State's Scoonie Penn. He'll also gladly talk about 
being just one game from the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Ask about his father, and the St. John's freshman simply says,  
``No comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, the point guard who has helped the Red Storm to their  
first regional semifinal since 1991, will answer any question about 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	But his father, who has been in a coma since being struck by a  
car in Philadelphia last month, isn't a topic for discussion. Not 
even with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have known if I hadn't read about it,'' junior  
Lavor Postell said. ``I guess that's the way he wants it right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Artest, Barkley's backcourt mate, also learned about the  
accident by reading the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could've been joking with him, and I didn't even know what  
happened. I don't know if he wants to talk about it, and he's 
acting regular like he's been acting since I first met him. He's a 
strong kid,'' Artest said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alonzo Barkley hasn't been a big factor in the life of his  
youngest son. Barkley said only that his dad left early. 
</P>
<P>
	The big influences in Barkley's life have been his older  
brother, who taught him how to play basketball in Brooklyn, and his 
mother. Barkley never misses a day without talking to Shirley by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother was the one who broke the news to him about his  
father in early February. His father apparently was standing on a 
sidewalk when a car jumped the curb and struck him. 
</P>
<P>
	Erick didn't miss a game or a practice. And while his father has  
spent the past month in the hospital, Barkley has been raising his 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reasons St. John's (28-8) will play Ohio State (26-8)  
Saturday in the South Regional final is Barkley. The team's 
third-leading scorer during the regular season, Barkley is the Red 
Storm's leading scorer in the postseason with 15.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored 24 points Thursday night in helping St. John's stop  
Maryland's bid for the Final Four. He has handed out 19 assists in 
three tournament games, and he is 11 points shy of the school's 
freshman scoring record held by Chris Mullin and Felipe Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I happy to be here? It's my first year playing Division I  
basketball. I'm excited as well as happy to be here,'' said 
Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
	His route to St. John's took a detour. Barkley, who turned 21 in  
February, had to repeat a year while at Christ the King High in New 
York, and he spent a year at Maine Central Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest and coach Mike Jarvis aren't surprised Barkley is playing  
so well. When growing up in the projects, basketball provides the 
only escape from life. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're always dealing with adversity,'' Jarvis said.  
``There's always something not in the ordinary. You almost come to 
expect the unexpected. They're better with dealing with them and 
coping with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Erick, like all kids, has overcome the odds and continues to  
do so. They stay focused with the chaos around them.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers Seek To Fix Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Losing streaks have been rare since Larry  
Bird started coaching the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Their longest losing streak last season was three games. They  
need to defeat Chicago tonight to avoid matching it, having dropped 
two in a row in the regular season for the first time since 
December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers went through their final 63 games of the 1997-98  
regular season without dropping two in a row and lost two straight 
only once in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers played 21 games this year before losing consecutive  
games. They lost 114-110 at Philadelphia on Tuesday night and 85-79 
to Atlanta on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After tonight's game, Indiana (15-7) plays four of its next five  
games on the road within a nine-day span. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we play better on the road. I don't know why,  
sometimes we play with more intensity and a lot more force,'' 
forward Antonio Davis said. ``We know we have to depend on each 
other. We have to stand together if we want to get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers need to take their skid seriously, point guard Mark  
Jackson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to approach it like you've lost five in a row,''  
Jackson said of tonight's game against the Bulls. ``We're a 
championship-caliber team and we cannot accept that (losing) no 
matter who we're playing, or where we're playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-game losing skid began after Indiana put together a  
four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing decent teams that are capable of beating us  
every single night. We have to bring our `A' game, plus we're a 
target right now,'' said Jackson, who along with Bird thought that 
Indiana played well in its loss at Philadelphia after a lackluster 
effort at home against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played hard,'' Bird said. ``We did a lot of good things. We  
just made too many turnovers in the fourth quarter, but we played 
and usually you're going to win games when you play like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana compiled a franchise-record 58-24 record in Bird's debut  
as a coach last season, reaching the Eastern Conference finals 
before losing Game 7 in an intense series to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're practicing as hard as we did last year.  
... It seems like we're really not going after it in practice like 
we did last year. It's a difficult year because we don't have 
enough opportunities to practice,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird had the team practice for about 75 minutes on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good one. We played back-to-back games,'' Bird said.  
``They were focused. We had some stuff to clean up and they did a 
good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Picked by many to win the league championship, the Pacers now  
find themselves trying to catch Orlando and Miami to compile the 
best record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very important. The last two times we came down to  
conference finals, we won all our games at home. We know if we have 
more games at home, we have home-court advantage and will give 
ourselves a better chance to win a championship,'' said Davis, who 
said being favored creates a different environment than the one the 
Pacers have faced in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals are set a little higher. Everything we do now is  
going to be magnified a little bit,'' Davis said. ``Losing two 
games in a row, we're going to have to pay a lot of attention and 
make sure that we correct those mistakes. ... We've got to figure 
out what's going on and we're going to have to fix those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also said he feels a difference between this team and last  
season, even though the roster is basically unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is fun anymore, even when you win, it's like you're  
expected to win. Even when you pull out a close win, it doesn't 
mean anything,'' he said. ``We need to get back to maybe having a 
little bit more fun. I think that when we did that, we came into 
the game with a lot more emotion.''

<HEADLINE> 'Draw' Judge Gets New Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British judge who scored last weekend's Lennox  
Lewis-Evander Holyfield fight a draw will work next on an April 3 
bout in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry O'Connell, heavily criticized for his scoring in the  
heavyweight title bout, will judge a British light middleweight 
title at Royal Albert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is on the undercard of a WBO heavyweight title fight  
between British champion Herbie Hide and American challenger Orlin 
Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Frank Warren said O'Connell would do a good job in the  
fight between Ensley Bingham and Nicky Thurbin. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I disagreed with the scoring with the Lewis fight, I  
fully respect his scoring ability and have never and would never 
question his honesty and integrity,'' Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry is one of the handful of world-class officials that  
we're lucky to have in (Britain). I feel that the criticism that he 
has come under is a disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell scored the fight at Madison Square Garden a 115-115  
draw. Another judge gave it to Britain's WBC champion Lewis and the 
third scored it for Holyfield, the WBA-IBF champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The decisions by O'Connell and the American judge who scored in  
favor of Holyfield sparked investigations of a fight Lewis was 
widely believed to have won.

<HEADLINE> Movies Revisit Cold War Over Kazan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Time has done nothing to quell the  
hurt and anger felt by those on Hollywood's blacklist toward the 
people who named their names. 
</P>
<P>
	At a raucous news conference Thursday, blacklisted screenwriters  
displayed ads bought in Hollywood trade papers denouncing a special 
Oscar going to director Elia Kazan, who identified Communist Party 
members during infamous hearings nearly 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``His actions did enormous damage to the motion picture  
industry, as well as established throughout the country a climate 
of fear which suppressed creativity and silenced dissent,'' says 
the ads to appear today in the Hollywood Reporter and Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads were unveiled by members of a group called the Committee  
Against Silence. At the event, interrupted by a heckler shouting 
``Communism is evil!,'' writers, entertainment union members and 
others said Kazan's testimony in 1952 denied many of his colleagues 
the opportunities for the same accomplishments he is being honored 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ruined and destroyed their careers, their families, their  
lives,'' said Norma Barzman, a 78-year-old blacklisted writer whose 
name was restored this month to the 1953 film ``Luxury Girls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 89-year-old Kazan will receive the lifetime achievement  
Oscar during Sunday night's televised ceremony. His critics have 
called on audience members to refrain from applauding when he 
accepts his award. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate news conference, Academy president Robert Rehme  
said the award was solely for Kazan's ``body of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a good side to the protest, it is that it has made  
people aware of that terrible period of our history and the impact 
of that,'' he said. ``But we stand by our award to Mr. Kazan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People who support the award have formed a group called the Ad  
Hoc Committee for Naming Facts, calling on Academy members to wear 
American flag lapel pins to the ceremony. Both sides have promised 
to demonstrate outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacklisted actor John Randolph, who has appeared in ``Serpico''  
and ``You've Got Mail,'' said Kazan gave credibility to the 
hearings by the House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a question of forgiveness. It's a question of  
remembrance,'' Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan has declined to comment on the controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Kazan, who had once been a member of the Communist Party,  
informed on eight friends from the Group Theater, the best known of 
whom were playwright Clifford Odets and actress Paula Strasberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the director never issued a blanket apology, but  
made it clear that he agonized over his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Even to his detractors, Kazan has long been considered one of  
the greatest stage and film directors. His debut film, ``A Tree 
Grows in Brooklyn'' in 1945, earned an Oscar for supporting actor 
James Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Kazan won a directing Oscar for ``Gentleman's  
Agreement,'' which also was named best picture. His second Oscar 
was for ``On the Waterfront,'' the 1954 film that made Marlon 
Brando a star. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan also was nominated for ``A Streetcar Named Desire''  
(1951), ``East of Eden'' (1955) and ``America'' (1963).

<HEADLINE> Old Anti-Depressants As Good As New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New drugs such as Prozac and old standbys such  
as Elavil are about equally effective in treating many types of 
depression, although patients on the newer drugs may have slightly 
fewer side effects, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of 264 studies of 32 different anti-depression  
compounds found ``no significant differences'' in efficacy among 
adult patients when new drugs were compared with those that have 
been around for many years, according to researchers at the 
Evidence-Based Practice Center in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there is not enough information to draw final  
conclusions about using the drugs for treatment of children, 
patients with special health needs and for treating some less 
common forms of depression, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers did the study to help the Health and Human  
Service Department's Agency for Health Care Policy and Research 
develop clinical guidelines for doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	The study used a technique called ``meta-analysis,'' which  
combines the results of hundreds of different studies to arrive at 
a statistical conclusion more powerful than is possible by any of 
the individual studies alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the analyzed studies were older drugs called  
tricyclic agents such as Elavil, and the newer serotonin uptake 
inhibitors such as Prozac and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as 
Nardil. 
</P>
<P>
	In treatment of adults with major depression, the study found  
that the old and new drugs were equally effective. The drugs 
produced a favorable response in about half the patients, compared 
with only 32 percent taking a placebo. Some studies found that the 
risk of major depression relapse was decreased by 70 percent with 
six months of treatment with the newer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the drugs had side effects, the study found, but the type  
and rates of the adverse reactions varied from drug to drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Diarrhea and nausea affected about 10 percent of the patients  
taking the Prozac class of drugs. Among patients taking the older 
drugs, 30 percent reported dry mouth, 12 percent had constipation 
and 11 percent had dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fewer patients taking (the new drugs) discontinued treatment  
due to adverse effects compared'' with the older drugs, the study 
found. But the dropout difference was slight: 4 percent vs. 5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found several gaps in what is known about  
antidepressants. For instance, there is not enough data to draw 
conclusions about the long-term use of anti-depressants by children 
and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the study said not enough is known to evaluate the use of  
the anti-depressants by patients with added health conditions such 
as HIV, renal failure, heart disease or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The study recommended that doctors making treatment decisions  
for major or chronic depression should consider both the old and 
the new drugs, taking into account such issues as cost, a patient's 
preferences and tolerance for particular types of side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	For other forms of depression, and for children and adolescents,  
the data on the new drugs ``are insufficient to guide treatment 
decisions,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Call May Have Come from Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A bomb threat that interrupted President Clinton's  
motorcade during a fund-raising visit last month may have come from 
within the Boston Police Department, the Boston Herald reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat was phoned into a police emergency line. Police  
believe it came from a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination of records from Cellular One, the main police  
phone provider, showed no emergency calls from those phones during 
the presidential visit, said a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Margot 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	However a source the Herald didn't identify said investigators  
have not ruled out that the threat could have been called in by 
someone from within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been some things that led us to believe it could  
have come (from a police phone),'' the source said, declining to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller apparently said a bomb was located on a truck along  
the motorcade route from Logan International Airport to the Park 
Plaza Hotel. The motorcade was briefly rerouted because of the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Kevin Jones said Friday that the investigation  
into the threat was continuing.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced in Valentine Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Md. (AP) -- A judge today sentenced a woman to life in  
prison for killing her husband after the couple watched a murder 
mystery play on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Horne also sentenced Kimberly Hricko to 30 years  
on a related arson conviction for setting fire to the room where 
her husband's body lay. The two sentences are to be served 
concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, first-degree murder carries an automatic life  
sentence, but judges have the authority to suspend all or part of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hricko, 33, has never admitted guilt in the death of  
Stephen Hricko, her husband of nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hricko's mother told the judge that Hricko's death had been  
devastating and asked him not to show leniency in sentencing Mrs. 
Hricko. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been the same,'' said Mary Hricko, 71. ``My  
husband can't talk about him without crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the judge imposed the sentence, Mrs. Hricko told  
him she prays every day that her husband's family can find peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel so sorry for all the sorrow and loss they've endured,''  
Mrs. Hricko said in a trembling voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hricko's attorneys immediately filed an appeal of the  
conviction and sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	During her January trial, friends and co-workers said she had  
confided to them that she was bitterly unhappy in her marriage and 
wanted to get rid of her husband. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mocks Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who did his best to duck  
reporters during a year of scandal and impeachment, decided to warm 
up for his news conference today with an appearance before a crowd 
of radio and television journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the questions. On Thursday night, the president went  
straight for testing out his responses. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I didn't watch it.''  
</P>
<P>
	``No, I haven't read it.''  
</P>
<P>
	``She was first, Sam.''  
</P>
<P>
	Trying to keep the simulation as real as possible, Clinton  
brought along a tool that has proved invaluable in staving off 
tough, scandal-related questions in the past months: a foreign head 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
	A sidekick adorned in a red sash and medals joined the president  
on-stage and helped entertain an audience of more than 2,000 
assembled for the Radio-Television Correspondents' Association 
Dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this isn't contrition, I don't know what is,'' Clinton  
quipped to an audience obviously wondering how he would deal with 
the Monica Lewinksy matter. The president acknowledged that if the 
Senate impeachment votes had gone a different way, he wouldn't be 
standing before this legion of Washington journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I demand a recount,'' he deadpanned.  
</P>
<P>
	But the disjunction between Clinton mingling with the very  
reporters who have plagued him for the past year became apparent at 
times, most notably when ABC News Correspondent Jackie Judd 
received an award for her coverage of the investigation of the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	As she walked across the stage where the Clintons and the vice  
president were seated, the president shook her hand, drawing cheers 
from the guests. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the president's graciousness this evening,'' Judd  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spared the House impeachment managers from his roasting,  
because he said they weren't in the audience to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all at the Taliban correspondents association  
dinner,'' he said. At least one Republican manager, Rep. Asa 
Hutchinson of Arkansas, looked on from his table. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Academy Awards close at hand, the president also gave  
his vote for some Washington dramas deserving of the honor. 
``Leaving Los Alamos,'' ``You Got Subpoenas,'' and ``Throw Mama in 
a Grand Jury'' were among his picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Humorist Garrison Keillor told the audience he empathized with  
their plight of writing about people who then get angry about it, 
citing his own public tiff with Minnesota Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' 
Ventura. Keillor has written a political satire based loosely on 
Ventura's election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly this 300-pound man with a shaved head and a Led  
Zeppelin T-shirt is vowing to get even with me,'' Keillor said. 
``I'd like to be able to compartmentalize and get my mind off him, 
but I don't have a compartment big enough for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Keillor made a  
pitch for her to run for a Senate seat in his state -- Minnesota -- 
saying that the rigors of campaigning in New York might be a little 
much for her. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of ``all of the pirogies you have to cheerfully put away  
in public places,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Espionage at Other Labs Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Beyond the case at Los Alamos, the Energy  
Department is examining if scientists at other U.S nuclear weapons 
labs may have disclosed sensitive neutron bomb and electromagnetic 
pulse technology to China, several government officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials cautioned, however, that many of the incidents  
being examined may never result in criminal charges and many 
allegations have already been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In closed-door briefings on Capitol Hill the past week, leading  
lawmakers were told of the expanding investigations, including one 
case of suspected espionage at the Argonne National Laboratory, 
which has facilities in Illinois and Idaho, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional sources who have been briefed, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said the Argonne probe involves the 
possible disclosure to China of neutron bomb technology by an 
Asian-American scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the law enforcement community there is sharp skepticism  
about the seriousness of the emerging cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argonne case involves a nuclear lab safety expert who does  
not work on weapons technology, and federal law enforcement 
investigators found no evidence of espionage, according to two 
senior law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The separate allegation that electromagnetic pulse technology  
was given to China also collapsed when investigated, a senior law 
enforcement official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	These officials said the only serious case to emerge from a  
welter of allegations was the Los Alamos matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senior law enforcement official said the Energy  
Department has referred dozens of tips to the FBI about possible 
security lapses, but ``99.9 percent of them turn out not to be 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional officials said the Argonne case is believed to  
have begun before President Clinton took office but investigators 
are looking at if the loss of sensitive data may have continued 
into his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	An Energy Department official said the suspected espionage began  
well before Clinton took office. But the official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said he had no information on whether it 
continued beyond 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the government officials would speak except on condition  
of anonymity, citing restrictions on classified information. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, sharply critical of Clinton's response to the Los  
Alamos case from the 1980s, are eager to find examples of alleged 
espionage during his tenure. At a news conference Friday, Clinton 
said he knows of no loss of nuclear weapons technology to China 
during his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me  
about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the labs 
during my presidency,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement and congressional officials disagree on whether  
the Argonne case is as severe as the alleged security breach at the 
Los Alamos lab, where officials suspect nuclear warhead technology 
was provided to China in the mid-1980s by a Taiwan-born American 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has known about the Los Alamos case since  
1995, but it wasn't reported publicly until news reports this year. 
The scientist was recently fired but has never been charged with 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	China has steadfastly denied any spying at the nuclear labs.  
</P>
<P>
	The congressional sources said the Energy Department is also  
investigating whether China gained electromagnetic pulse weapon 
technology, which is similar to the neutron bomb, from several of 
the nuclear weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the case that, according to a senior law enforcement  
official, has collapsed under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior congressional official said the employee in the  
Argonne case has been under clandestine monitoring as 
counterintelligence officials try to develop their suspicions into 
a solid case. The officials declined to provide the employee's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has downplayed the significance  
of any new espionage cases, saying ``there are a number of 
investigations but there are no other cases similar to the ones 
that have surfaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Argonne lab, oldest of the nation's nuclear research  
facilities, is primarily devoted to pure scientific research. But 
weapons labs such as Sandia and Los Alamos conduct weapons-related 
work at Argonne facilities.. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab is run by the University of Chicago under contract with  
the Department of Energy. The research center is about 25 miles 
southwest of Chicago but some of its key research infrastructure, 
including a neutron accelerator, is at a site in the Snake River 
Valley west of Idaho Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The neutron bomb was a weapon developed and deployed late in the  
Cold War and designed to kill enemy forces and knock out enemy 
electronics without doing extensive physical damage or creating an 
overwhelming fallout cloud. The weapons are no longer deployed.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Seek To Fix Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Losing streaks have been rare since Larry  
Bird started coaching the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Their longest losing streak last season was three games. They  
need to defeat Chicago tonight to avoid matching it, having dropped 
two in a row in the regular season for the first time since 
December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers went through their final 63 games of the 1997-98  
regular season without dropping two in a row and lost two straight 
only once in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers played 21 games this year before losing consecutive  
games. They lost 114-110 at Philadelphia on Tuesday night and 85-79 
to Atlanta on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	After tonight's game, Indiana (15-7) plays four of its next five  
games on the road within a nine-day span. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we play better on the road. I don't know why,  
sometimes we play with more intensity and a lot more force,'' 
forward Antonio Davis said. ``We know we have to depend on each 
other. We have to stand together if we want to get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers need to take their skid seriously, point guard Mark  
Jackson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to approach it like you've lost five in a row,''  
Jackson said of tonight's game against the Bulls. ``We're a 
championship-caliber team and we cannot accept that (losing) no 
matter who we're playing, or where we're playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-game losing skid began after Indiana put together a  
four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing decent teams that are capable of beating us  
every single night. We have to bring our `A' game, plus we're a 
target right now,'' said Jackson, who along with Bird thought that 
Indiana played well in its loss at Philadelphia after a lackluster 
effort at home against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played hard,'' Bird said. ``We did a lot of good things. We  
just made too many turnovers in the fourth quarter, but we played 
and usually you're going to win games when you play like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana compiled a franchise-record 58-24 record in Bird's debut  
as a coach last season, reaching the Eastern Conference finals 
before losing Game 7 in an intense series to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're practicing as hard as we did last year.  
... It seems like we're really not going after it in practice like 
we did last year. It's a difficult year because we don't have 
enough opportunities to practice,'' Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird had the team practice for about 75 minutes on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good one. We played back-to-back games,'' Bird said.  
``They were focused. We had some stuff to clean up and they did a 
good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Picked by many to win the league championship, the Pacers now  
find themselves trying to catch Orlando and Miami to compile the 
best record in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very important. The last two times we came down to  
conference finals, we won all our games at home. We know if we have 
more games at home, we have home-court advantage and will give 
ourselves a better chance to win a championship,'' said Davis, who 
said being favored creates a different environment than the one the 
Pacers have faced in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals are set a little higher. Everything we do now is  
going to be magnified a little bit,'' Davis said. ``Losing two 
games in a row, we're going to have to pay a lot of attention and 
make sure that we correct those mistakes. ... We've got to figure 
out what's going on and we're going to have to fix those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also said he feels a difference between this team and last  
season, even though the roster is basically unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is fun anymore, even when you win, it's like you're  
expected to win. Even when you pull out a close win, it doesn't 
mean anything,'' he said. ``We need to get back to maybe having a 
little bit more fun. I think that when we did that, we came into 
the game with a lot more emotion.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Justifies Serb Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Kosovo peace talks collapsed, President  
Clinton today laid out for the American people the justification 
for U.S.-led air strikes that he said will follow if Serb leaders 
ignore Western efforts to avoid bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we and our allies don't have the will to act, there will be  
more massacres,'' Clinton declared, acknowledging that U.S. pilots 
would be put at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first full-fledged news conference in nearly a year,  
Clinton said, ``I do not want to put a single American pilot in the 
air. I do not want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not want 
a conflict ... but a part of my responsibility is to try to leave 
to my successors an environment in Europe that is stable, humane 
and secure.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Captures America's Heartmatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In Salt Lake City, John Stockton is jazzed.  
Somewhere in crooner heaven, Bing Crosby must be warbling 
``Hallelujah!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga, the school that brought Stockton and Crosby to the  
world, is producing NCAA tournament magic in the West. One more 
victory Saturday and the little Jesuit college from Spokane, Wash., 
will be in the Final Four, the first No. 10 seed to make it that 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstacle, however, is Connecticut, the No. 1 seed, a team  
with speed, depth and two of the country's best players, Richard 
Hamilton and Khalid El-Amin. It's a team ready to finally erase 
coach Jim Calhoun's stigma of coming close again and again but 
never quite getting his team to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, who impatiently refutes the notion that his program  
can't win the big ones, praises Gonzaga as no fluke, not after 
tournament victories over Minnesota, Stanford and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception will be that this is a David and Goliath  
thing,'' Calhoun said. ``It isn't. I told our players that Gonzaga 
isn't a national name, but it is a national team. You don't worry 
about what name is on the jersey. You need to worry about what's in 
the jersey, and they have a lot of heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not to mention at least six players who can make 3-pointers with  
deadly accuracy, and oft-overlooked front-line players who were 
able to outrebound Stanford and got the winning basket, on Casey 
Calvary's tip-in, in Thursday night's 73-72 victory over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of an obscure team with a confident, loose  
personality and an intriguing, pass-oriented style that emphasizes 
teamwork has made the Bulldogs the darlings of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's America and they love the underdog,'' Gonzaga coach Dan  
Monson said Friday. ``It is a great story. We've only been in the 
tournament once and we've never won a game before. The other thing, 
I would hope, is the quality of kids we have. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at those kids and say, `Hey, these are good kids  
who play basketball the right way, who are fun to watch.' You can 
see their chemistry and how well they like each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of the tournament, the Zags have insisted they  
belong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't come into the tournament feeling like, `We're here.  
We've finished our season. We made it to the NCAA tournament; now 
let's get stomped by somebody,''' Calvary said. ``Game after game, 
we've been confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That confidence even extends to a game against Connecticut, a  
team that has won 31 of 33, a team whose least-known starter, 
Calhoun notes, got more national attention than the entire Gonzaga 
team this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants their moment,'' Calhoun said, ``and this is  
their moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson knows that Connecticut has more talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we had to play Connecticut 10 times over the long haul,  
we'd be in pretty big trouble,'' Monson said. ``But the bottom line 
is we don't have to play them 10 times. We've got to play them for 
40 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut's players are shrugging off the burden of Calhoun's  
legacy. This is the fourth time Calhoun has taken the Huskies to a 
regional final in the 1990s. He's lost the other three -- to Duke, 
UCLA and, last year, to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no control over the past teams that never reached the  
Final Four,'' El-Amin said. ``All we can do is focus on this year. 
We know we have a good shot of reaching it. You're going to see a 
very feisty group out there just ready to take care of business. We 
can only focus on this year and what we can do right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun repeatedly points out that his Connecticut teams have  
won more than 800 games, and more than 70 percent of their NCAA 
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we win tomorrow, I won't be any better coach,'' he said.  
``If we are unfortunate and we lose tomorrow, I won't be any worse 
coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies aren't just talking Final Four, they're talking  
national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all the talent on our team to do it,'' Hamilton said.  
</P>
<P>
	First, the Huskies must hold off Gonzaga's perimeter game, a  
3-point barrage that Calhoun hasn't seen since Rick Pitino's 
Providence team shot its way into the Final Four in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In its three tournament games, Gonzaga is 32-for-63 from 3-point  
range (51 percent), while shooting just 39 percent from inside the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zags, meanwhile, will try to get more offense from inside,  
and somehow keep the Huskies from running. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to try to make them be a jump-shooting team,''  
Monson said. ``Nobody's really been successful at that all year, 
but that's something we've got to go in and try to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Zags insist they will be expecting to succeed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you hope you make a shot, it's not going in. You've got to  
expect it's going in,'' Monson said. ``We've got to expect to win 
tomorrow. That's the attitude I've had with these kids in every 
game we've played this year, and certainly tomorrow's got to be no 
different.''

<HEADLINE> Tyson Could Get Released Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Mike Tyson could be released from jail as  
early as March 26 if his lawyer's proposal is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Thursday that Judge Stephen Johnson  
of Montgomery County (Md.) Court told the former heavyweight 
champion's attorneys and the prosecutor he would rule March 26 on a 
request to reduce Tyson's one-year sentence for assault to eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	If Tyson's sentence were cut to eight months, the 50 days that  
he will have served in the Montgomery jail by next week would make 
him eligible immediately for a work-release program, to be followed 
by home detention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported, however, that a top corrections official said  
if Tyson is released he probably would be placed in home detention 
immediately because other inmates' activities would be disrupted by 
what he described as the media frenzy.

<HEADLINE> Dow Clings to 10,000 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average hovered above  
the 10,000 mark today as an early rally was deflated by weakness in 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 9.71 at 10,007.33. The  
index of blue chips soared nearly 88 points in the first hour of 
trading before sinking steadily throughout the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is struggling to extend its stay above the vaunted  
10,000 milestone for more than a few moments. On Thursday, the 
Dow's 118.21-point gain was nearly overlooked as the index made six 
dramatic bounces above 10,000 in the final minutes of trading. 
Thursday's close left the Dow at a record high of 9,997.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Dow component General Electric led the blue chips higher  
after a Lehman Brothers analyst issued a favorable report on its 
international growth prospects. Its shares rose 2 5/8 to 112 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also appeared to benefit from the volatility that  
accompanied a ``triple witching'' session. Today is one of four 
days during the year when contracts on stock options, index 
options, and index futures all expire. Triple witching typically 
adds volatility as portfolio managers rush to buy or sell stocks to 
square their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks introduced some weakness to the market. IBM  
fell 3 3/8 to 174 3/16. Analysts have begun questioning the strength 
of computer makers' earnings for the nearly completed quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by technology stocks,  
reversed early gains and was down 9.60 at 2,453.36. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which has set its own string of  
records in recent weeks, also slipped after a strong morning, and 
was off 0.91 at 1,315.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a robust 479.2 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index slipped 1.16 to 616.45, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.56 at 713.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets around the world flourished following the Dow's strong  
rally on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei index soared 4.2 higher to its 
best finish since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading in Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 2.5  
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.2 percent, and France's 
CAC-40 was up 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Man Misfires Gun, Kills Neighbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLORSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- A man sitting in an armchair watching  
the morning news was shot to death today when his upstairs neighbor 
accidentally fired a gun through the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth E. Howard, 58, was struck in the chest by a 9 mm bullet,  
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bolton, 19, was visiting friends in the upstairs apartment  
and was handling a gun when it apparently discharged into the 
floor, Salt Lake County sheriff's Deputy Peggy Faulkner said. 
</P>
<P>
	After being shot, Howard walked about 10 steps toward the  
bathroom before collapsing on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton's friends immediately called police.  
</P>
<P>
	Bolton, who lives nearby, fled after the shooting and was  
arrested hours later, Faulkner said. He was booked in the Salt Lake 
County Jail for investigation.

<HEADLINE> Fleischer, Clark Win Downhill Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- It's called the Wildflower run, and the  
United States' top skiers say it's a beauty. 
</P>
<P>
	The course was christened on Friday with the men's and women's  
national downhill championships. Skiers unanimously praised famed 
course designer Bernhard Russi's latest creation, which will host 
the 2002 Olympic downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Fleischer and Kirsten Clark won the respective national  
titles, but the real star of the day was Snowbasin Ski Resort's 
Wildflower, a course that skiers say combines aggressive speed with 
exceptional technical challenges. The course's name was first 
disclosed to the public earlier on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really important that we have courses like this if we  
want to have quality skiers on the world scene,'' Fleischer said. 
``Today was just the first step in that process, and with courses 
like this and (Colorado's) Birds of Prey, we've got the facilities 
we need to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The races were contested under cloudless skies in 60-degree  
weather as Utah's early spring continued to inconvenience the 
national championships. The starting times for Friday's races were 
moved up 2 1/2 hours to minimize the sun's impact on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time Olympian Fleischer, fresh off a stellar World Cup  
season capped with a second-place finish in the downhill 
championships March 11 in Spain, smoked the field for his second 
national title in downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer finished in 1 minute, 13.54 seconds, nearly a  
half-second better than runnerup Daron Rahlves. The 27-year-old 
Vail, Colo., native did it despite a severe cold and an eye 
infection that necessitated a trip down Ogden Mountain to see a 
doctor before the awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the run, Fleischer said he felt fluid collecting in his  
eye and impairing his vision. It worsened as he came down -- until a 
fortuitous crash into a gate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit the gate with my knee, and then it whipped up and hit me  
in the head,'' he said with a smile. ``The impact cleared out my 
eye, and I was on my way after that. It was perfect timing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rahlves, also battling a cold, continued his strong recovery  
from an early-season injury with a 1:13.98 run. The two-time 
national giant slalom champion was followed by promising junior 
Marco Sullivan at 1:14.48, Paul Casey Puckett at 1:14.58 and Dane 
Spencer at 1:14.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's race featured fewer high-profile skiers. Most  
conspicuously, Olympic champion Picabo Street, a two-time winner of 
the event, missed her third straight national championships because 
of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Street's absence, Clark won her second consecutive national  
downhill title with an aggressive run of 1:18.00. Clark's 
underwhelming second season on the World Cup circuit improved in 
her final races last month, and she hopes her American 
championship, her first victory of the year, will lead to better 
things in 1999-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to come back and race in the U.S.,'' said Clark, of  
Raymond, Maine. ``I had trouble with some of the technical parts of 
the course during training, but today I was a lot better. This is 
great for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Lalive, who won the gold medal in combined in the World  
Junior Championships in France last week, finished second at 
1:18.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety, who in 1995 won the last women's national  
championship race at Snowbasin, and Jonna Mendes tied for third at 
1:18.40. Katie Monahan took fifth at 1:18.57. 
</P>
<P>
	Wildflower will host an International Ski Federation downhill on  
Saturday. The next national championship to be contested will be 
the women's super-G on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Get Senate Leader's Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, collecting still  
more of the Democratic Party's establishment, will get the 
endorsement of Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, aides said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore rearranged a campaign swing through Iowa and will head to  
Sioux Falls, S.D., for the endorsement on Monday, said aides who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. Daschle is a South Dakotan. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is yet another sign that powerful forces in the  
Democratic Party are seeking to settle the nomination early, 
allowing the party to focus on the general election and retaining 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,  
D-Mo., who had once considered seeking the nomination himself, 
endorsed Gore. He would have been a potent rival, but decided to 
focus instead on effort to win back control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Daschle and Vice President Gore will be in South  
Dakota Monday'' to visit an innovative elementary school, said 
Daschle spokeswoman Molly Rowley. ``Senator Daschle is not ready to 
make an announcement at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has formed an exploratory committee to look at seeking the  
Democratic presidential nomination, and is considered a virtual 
certainty to run, with a formal announcement coming later. 
</P>
<P>
	The only announced opposition to Gore is former New Jersey Sen.  
Bill Bradley, who argues he's more electable than Gore. Bradley is 
running an active campaign in key early states like Iowa and New 
Hampshire, but polls show him trailing Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time candidate Jesse Jackson also is mulling a run, but has  
yet to announce his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a big and growing field on the Republican side of the  
aisle, with considerable early jostling already under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Early polling has shown Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Elizabeth  
Dole atop the GOP field, and shows both of those candidates running 
strong against Gore. Gore backers hope to erase that edge by 
building an air of inevitability about Gore's candidacy, which will 
leave him unscathed while Republicans engage in a serious fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has stepped up the pace of his campaign in recent days. He  
launched a high-profile swing through Iowa and New Hampshire 
earlier this week, and was following that with another swing on 
Monday. Precinct caucuses in Iowa launch the presidential 
nominating season, followed quickly by the nation's first primary 
in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Teen to Plead Guilty in Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A teen-ager accused of killing an  
11-year-old neighbor who was selling items door to door for a 
school fund-raiser has agreed to plead guilty, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Manzie, 17, was scheduled to enter his plea before Judge  
Peter Giovine this afternoon, Ocean County Prosecutor E. David 
Millard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Millard's statement did not specify what Manzie would plead  
guilty to. He was charged with murder, robbery and aggravated 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Werner of Jackson Township was robbed, raped and murdered  
on Sept. 27, 1997, as he was out selling gift wrap and other 
holiday items for the PTA. Manzie allegedly killed him after luring 
him into his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie had been scheduled to be tried as an adult beginning  
April 12. His lawyers had originally planned a ``diminished 
capacity'' defense, in which they would argue Manzie, 15 at the 
time of the killing, had a mental defect that prevented him from 
forming the intent necessary to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing occurred three days after Manzie's parents sought  
unsuccessfully to have a judge commit the boy to an institution 
because of erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense also had been expected to cite Manzie's involvement  
with alleged pedophile Stephen P. Simmons -- a 43-year-old man he 
met in an online chat room. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Simmons carried on a sexual relationship with  
the teen that included hotel room trysts and photographs of sex 
acts. Simmons, of Holbrook, N.Y., faces nine counts in the case, 
including sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie, who was in sixth grade, was hoping to win a walkie-talkie  
set by selling the most items when he disappeared from his 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzie allegedly killed the boy when he rejected Manzie's sexual  
advances. Afterward, he took a photograph of the boy's half-naked 
body, a necktie and an alarm clock cord still around his neck, 
according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	He then stuffed the 4-foot-11 inch, 60-pound body into a  
suitcase and dragged it into a wooded area, where it was found two 
days later, prosecutors said. Manzie was arrested within days.

<HEADLINE> ISU Plays Underdog Status to Hilt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Iowa State played its underdog status to the  
hilt Friday as the Cyclones prepared for top-seeded Connecticut in 
the NCAA Mideast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only people who think we have a chance to win are the  
people riding on our bus,'' said Stacy Frese, Iowa State's leading 
scorer at 17.3 points a game. ``And maybe not all of them think we 
have a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (29-4), making its sixth consecutive appearance in  
the Sweet Sixteen, and Iowa State (24-7), here for the first time, 
meet in the noon game at the Shoemaker Center at the University of 
Cincinnati. Clemson (26-5) faces Georgia (25-6) in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, the nation's scoring leader, is used to crushing  
opponents by better than 30 points a game. The Huskies also lead in 
rebound margin, pulling down 13 more per game than opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	But coach Geno Auriemma also knows that Frese was 8-for-8 from  
3-point range against Nebraska this season, and 7-for-7 against 
Baylor last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a team that has a really good point guard,  
who has the ball in her hands a lot, you have a good team,'' 
Auriemma said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of what else they have, if they have a good point  
guard who's going to handle the ball a lot and take a lot of shots 
and distribute the ball and get it in other people's hands, then 
they're already ahead of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Taylor is the ``what else'' for Iowa State, averaging 15.7  
points a game. She said the Cyclones will have to avoid falling too 
far behind early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first five to 10 minutes are crucial,'' she said. ``If you  
get down early, your confidence will drop. Against a team like 
UConn, you might not be able to come back. We need to start well to 
keep our confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut has never lost in the first round of a regional. The  
Huskies feature Shea Ralph (17.2 points a game) and Svetlana 
Abrosimova (16.8). 
</P>
<P>
	The Clemson-Georgia matchup pits two tournament stalwarts. It's  
the 12th NCAA appearance for Clemson, including every year this 
decade except 1995, and the 16th for Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think our basketball team is playing its very best  
right now,'' Clemson coach Jim Davis said. ``As a coach, that's 
what you want to happen. You try to get your team peaking at the 
right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson has four players, all seniors, averaging in double  
figures, including guards Amy Geren (13.6) and Itoro Umoh (12.7). 
</P>
<P>
	``Our chemistry is pretty good,'' Umoh said. ``There are four  
seniors, and we're always helping each other out. I know if Amy 
scores 30, I don't have to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia has the best sister story in the Mideast, the 5-foot-10  
Miller twins from Rochester, Minn., both on a pre-medicine track. 
Coco Miller averages 19.1, Kelly Miller 18.1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really close, the best of friends,'' Kelly said. ``We  
really like playing together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're both guards in Georgia's three-guard offense, and the  
only players with double-digit averages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The post is where Clemson might have an advantage, but maybe  
we have an advantage on the perimeter. I like our guards,'' coach 
Andy Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wouldn't mind a low-scoring game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got all the confidence in the world if we don't put a lot  
of points on the board, because we're a good defensive team,'' 
Landers said.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Loiselle Regains Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Rich Loiselle has everything a manager  
could want in a closer: The glare. The attitude. The velocity. The 
mentality. 
</P>
<P>
	Some relievers look more like starting pitchers, some never  
master the walk, the look or the posture of the best closers -- the 
Gossages, the Eckersleys, the Sutters. 
</P>
<P>
	At 6-foot-5 and 245 pounds, Loiselle possesses the size and air  
of intimidation that made Gossage and Sutter even tougher to hit in 
the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	What Loiselle didn't have last year was his control, either of  
his pitches or his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	His saves dropped from 29 in 1997 to 19; his blown saves  
increased from five to eight. His ERA climbed from 3.10 to 3.44 
and, most alarming of all to the Pirates, his walks jumped from 24 
in 72 2-3 innings in 1997 to 36 in 55 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering that closers usually operate with the narrowest of  
margins for error, Loiselle often was the main cause of his own 
problems. And his problems were many. 
</P>
<P>
	He especially had trouble getting over his bad days. Sometimes,  
he found himself brooding over a faulty performance even as he was 
warming up for his next outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing was that he walked a lot of guys early in  
innings and that got him into a lot of trouble,'' Pirates manager 
Gene Lamont said. ``His stuff was OK, but he had trouble locating 
his pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't help that Loiselle had a young and error-prone defense  
behind him or that, shortly before going on the disabled list in 
July with a strained back muscle, he temporarily lost his closer's 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked more guys than I did the year before and, being in  
the closer's role, you can't come in and walk the leadoff guy,'' 
Loiselle said. `It's not so much the base hits that hurt you, it's 
the guy you walk before the hits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loiselle traces some of his problems to his injury and his  
spring training preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't want to make excuses,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He went to camp in 1997 as a starting pitcher, so he had already  
thrown a lot of innings before being converted to a reliever in 
April. Last year, he pitched only 12 innings in 11 exhibition 
games, so he didn't feel nearly as strong when the season started. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, he is again pitching a lot of innings to build up  
his arm strength. He pitched 10 innings in his first four 
appearances, twice lasting three innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't start pitching just one inning a day again until his  
next time out, probably on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going out and throwing the ball around the plate a lot  
more,'' said Loiselle, who has walked only two in those 10 innings. 
``I'm not always getting the results I like, but I think it's going 
to benefit me in the long run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also looks like the pitcher he was in 1997, when his 29 saves  
were the second most for a rookie to Todd Worrell's 36 for St. 
Louis in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of stuff going on with me last year. I got too  
much stuff in my head and that was part of my downfall,'' Loiselle 
said. ``But I've forgotten about last year and I'm looking forward 
to coming out there this year and throwing the way the way I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, that meant throwing 95 miles per hour in the lower half  
of the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Loiselle is appreciative that Lamont kept him in the closer's  
role despite his erratic 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the role. I've asked if I would ever want to be a  
starter again, and the answer is no,'' he said. ``I like to be out 
there with the pressure on me. If I blow a save, it's my fault. 
Only this year, I'm not going to let it bother me the next day if I 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall in Light Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond fell Friday amid speculation that AT&AMP;T  
Corp. will substantially increase next week's planned sale of 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 29/32  
point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.55 percent from 5.49 percent late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds were undercut by concern about a flood of new bonds coming  
to market. AT&AMP;T already has announced plans to sell $5 billion to 
$6 billion in bonds. But there has been increasing speculation that 
the offering will be substantially increased to meet investor 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys showed little reaction Friday to news that the  
government's fiscal picture dimmed somewhat in February, as the 
total budget deficit widened to $42.87 billion from a $41.75 
billion gap a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 3/32 point and 7/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
fell between 5/16 point and 9/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.80 
points to 1,286.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.50 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.39 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.62 percent, as the discount was unchanged from 
Thursday at 4.45 percent. One-year yields were 4.71 percent as the 
discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.49 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged from late Thursday at 4.75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 125 5/32 from 125 1/4. The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.17 percent.

	HUNTSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- Chad Fleischer and Kirsten Clark won the

Snowbasin Ski Resort's brand new Wildflower course.

<HEADLINE> Bosox' Garciaparra Has Arm Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra said Friday that he  
has had ``sharp pain'' in his arm and has been unable to throw a 
baseball for the past nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, the Boston Red Sox shortstop and runner-up in the  
AL MVP race last year, injured a tendon in his right biceps last 
Thursday against Toronto. He has been limited to designated hitter 
duty since then with what the Red Sox called tendinitis in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to a player of his caliber we tend to be  
cautious on how we handle these things,'' manager Jimy Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra was ``encouraged'' by a light catch he had at a  
workout Friday, according to team spokesman Kevin Shea. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra denied reports in Friday's Boston Herald that he is  
considering flying back to his home in California to get a second 
opinion on the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has not crossed my mind yet,'' said Garciaparra, who did  
not travel with the Red Sox to Sarasota on Friday for their game 
against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said ``that's a matter we are handling in-house and  
considering today's players I wouldn't be surprised if that 
occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes to a Boston camp that is still dealing with  
injuries to second baseman Jeff Frye, first baseman Reggie 
Jefferson and outfielder Midre Cummings. Frye has a ribcage and 
groin injury and is expected to make his spring training debut 
Saturday while Cummings is day-to-day with an injured hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams announced earlier this week that Jefferson, healing  
from an injured back, will not be ready for the start of the 
season.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ends Work on Altered Soybean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Authorities in a southern state of  
Brazil ordered work stopped Friday on a plantation where chemical 
conglomerate Monsanto is growing a new genetically altered soybean. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes only days after Rio Grande do Sul state ordered  
Monsanto to provide environmental impact statements for all the 
areas where they are growing genetically altered crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever fails to inform the agriculture secretariat (about  
research on genetically altered organisms) cannot continue to 
work,'' said Jose Hermeto Hoffman, the state's agriculture 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto's director of corporate affairs, Rodrigo Almeida, said  
the company would go to court in order to continue production of 
the genetically modified soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the Brazilian government approved Monsanto's  
request to produce the genetically modified seeds, which are 
designed to withstand a powerful herbicide also made by Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Monsanto withdrew its application to  
register the seeds as intellectual property claiming they needed to 
make some corrections to the application. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said Monsanto was the first company to have operations  
halted under a decree issued on March 3, which requires companies 
working with genetically modified organisms to obtain a license 
from the state. The state will now monitor operations at all 
Monsanto plantations to ensure that no genetically altered grains 
make it to market. 
</P>
<P>
	With 160 million people, Brazil is an important part of the  
Monsanto's plan to engineer the genetic codes of crops grown in 
different regions around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto still hopes to distribute the seeds produced in Brazil  
for commercial planting by mid-1999, for harvest in early 2000.

</P>
<P>
	WATERTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Hampartzoum Berberian, a composer of  
vocal, choral, operatic, symphonic and chamber works, died of 
cancer Saturday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Berberian's compositions included ``Lincoln at Gettysburg,'' a  
choral work inspired by the Gettysburg Address, and ``Requiem 
Aeternam,'' based on a poem by Yeghishe Charentz commemorating the 
massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 
1920.

</P>
<P>
	DENISON, Texas (AP) -- Claud Easterly, a longtime newsman and  
editor of The Denison Herald for 30 years, died Tuesday of 
pneumonia after undergoing surgery. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 47 years as a journalist, Easterly interviewed five  
U.S. presidents, bandleader John Philip Sousa, magician Harry 
Houdini, heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis, and many other 
state and national dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Easterly began his career at the Herald in 1925.  
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1940s Easterly was named editor of the newspaper,  
but he also continued to write throughout his career, even beyond 
his retirement in 1972. He contributed several stories to the 
Herald Democrat since the merger of his old newspaper with the 
Sherman Democrat in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, David Easterly, is a member of The Associated Press  
board of directors and president and chief operating officer of Cox 
Enterprises, an Atlanta-based media company that owns and operates 
more than a dozen newspapers, about a dozen TV stations and more 
than 50 radio stations.

who wrote scores for ``Exodus,'' ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad 
World,'' ``On the Beach'' and ``The Secret of Santa Vittoria,'' 
died Wednesday of complications from a stroke. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's most recognized work was the score of the 1960 movie  
``Exodus,'' for which he won an Academy Award and two Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	He received Academy Awards nominations for best score and best  
song for the 1963 film ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,'' and 
also received nominations for 1959's ``On the Beach'' and the 1969 
movie ``The Secret of Santa Vittoria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His credits also included ``Smooth As Silk,'' ``Wyoming,''  
``Witness for the Prosecution,'' ``The Pride and the Passion,''

who did album covers for Frank Sinatra and promotion posters for 
the movie ``Ben Hur,'' died Monday of prostate cancer. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who painted under the name Jim Jonson, was a junior

he took a set design job with 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, his personal artwork sold in galleries and  
museums nationwide while he supported himself with commercial work 
for record companies, Hollywood studios and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson later moved to New York, where he became known for  
sports paintings that he sold to Sports Illustrated, private 
collectors and corporations.

                         *Jean Pierre-Bloch    	
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Jean Pierre-Bloch, a former Resistance leader and  
one of France's most outspoken human rights advocates, died 
Wednesday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre-Bloch was a well-known writer who denounced racism and  
oppression of minorities worldwide. He was honorary president of 
the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
	He began a career in journalism in 1930 and wrote for several  
French newspapers, but eventually turned to politics. In 1936, at 
31, he became the youngest member of parliament in the leftist, 
Popular Front government led by Leon Blum. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939, Pierre-Bloch joined the French military and was  
captured after the outbreak of World War II, later escaping to join 
the French Resistance headed by Gen. Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1941 he organized the first parachute drops of men and  
supplies in Nazi-occupied France and became one of the Gestapo's 
most wanted figures. He was arrested in Spain and sentenced to 
death by the pro-Nazi Vichy regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Again Pierre-Bloch managed to escape, fleeing to London to join  
de Gaulle, under whom he held numerous posts, including head of 
intelligence operations until France was liberated in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Pierre-Bloch sat on an honor board that ruled in favor  
of Maurice Papon's claim that he worked for the Resistance while 
acting as local official under the Vichy government. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, Pierre-Bloch reversed himself. Rebutting a key  
defense argument, he testified at the former Vichy official's war 
crimes trial that Papon was not a member of the Resistance. Papon 
was found guilty of complicity in crimes against humanity and 
sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre-Bloch was a frequent contributor to Le Monde, and wrote  
several books including ``Charles de Gaulle'' (1944), ``The Causes 
of Anti-Semitism in France'' (1956) and ``London, The Capital of 
Free France'' (1985).

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ray Russell, a prolific horror and fantasy  
writer and a former executive editor of Playboy magazine, died 
Monday from complications from a stroke. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to seven novels, Russell wrote dozens of stories  
that appeared in 100 various anthologies. His works were translated 
into several languages. 
</P>
<P>
	His 1960 novella, ``Sardonicus,'' was praised by writer Stephen  
King as ``perhaps the finest example of the modern Gothic ever 
written.'' The tale, about a man who suffers hideous consequences 
when he digs up his father's grave to retrieve a winning lottery 
ticket, was made into the 1961 film ``Mr. Sardonicus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Playboy in 1954, serving as an associate editor. He  
was executive editor from 1955-1960. He remained a contributing 
editor to Playboy into the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	His last published novel was 1992's ``Absolute Power.''  
</P>
<P>
	Illness later forced him into retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell held the 1991 World Fantasy Award for life achievement  
and the 1993 Bram Stoker Award for life achievement from the Horror 
Writers Association.

	CARMEL, Calif. (AP) -- Walter Decker Scott, a former NBC chairman  
who led the network when it committed itself to color programming 
in the mid-1960s, died March 12 of complications from pneumonia. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott joined the network as a salesman in 1937 and was named  
chairman and chief executive in 1966. He was also elected a 
director of RCA, which was bought by General Electric in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott was credited with persuading the network to risk  
production cost increases by adopting a schedule of color 
programming in 1965. He based his idea in part on information 
showing that families with color sets watched television more than 
families with black-and-white sets. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC advertised itself as being ``The Full Color Network'' and  
added its peacock logo. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring to Carmel in 1974, he joined the board of Quail  
Meadows, a real estate and hotel business. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott is survived by his wife of 58 years, Arline Stenz Scott;  
two daughters; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Secession From L.A. Is Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Faced with the threat of losing up to 60  
percent of the city's population to secession, lawmakers are hoping 
to mollify disaffected suburban residents with the promise of more 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal to reform Los Angeles' 74-year-old city charter would  
create neighborhood councils with local control; decentralize 
decisions on planning and zoning; and give voters the option to 
increase the City Council's size. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may not be enough to appease residents of the San  
Fernando Valley, who believe their neighborhoods have become 
overshadowed by Los Angeles, one of the nation's largest cities at 
467 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``L.A. is just too big,'' said Kathy Guerra, who works at a  
gardening shop in Sherman Oaks, one of the neighborhoods 
considering leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Sherman Oaks and other parts of the Valley took a  
crucial step toward secession that could put the issue on the 
ballot in 2002. Similar movements are afoot in communities that 
make up the majority of the city's 3.6 million population. 
</P>
<P>
	Secession proponents say Los Angeles would be better off with  
smaller government. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents fear such a move would tangle bureaucracy, hurt  
the poor and minorities by dividing voting blocs in a city proud of 
its diversity and diminish Los Angeles' clout. 
</P>
<P>
	If the three largest communities seceded, Los Angeles would  
remain racially and economically mixed. Within its borders would be 
the downtown skyline recognizable in such TV shows as ``L.A. Law,'' 
the tourist attractions of Hollywood, the poor black and Hispanic 
neighborhoods of South Central and Watts, and largely Hispanic East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan has warned that secession would reduce the  
kind of pull that enabled Los Angeles to secure $10 billion in aid 
after the 1994 earthquake. He also said the move would ``dilute a 
level of Los Angeles' diversity, which is what has made us a great 
city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A vote in June to reform the city's charter could stall the  
threatened flight from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, elected and appointed commissions hammered out a  
proposal on how best to revise a Progressive-era document written 
for a predominantly white, relatively small city into one that can 
meet the needs of today. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize people at least saw the vision that if we don't do  
something we're going to collapse,'' said H. Eric Schockman, a 
professor of political science at the University of Southern 
California and a policy director for one of the commissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say both the charter reform and secession movements  
speak to a broader trend: decentralizing and restructuring 
government. Similar reform has been tried in other U.S. cities like 
Portland, Ore. Secession has long been an issue in New York's 
Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, officials involved in the reform see the new  
charter as a rare -- perhaps last -- chance to keep the city 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is enough in the charter that says: `We do hear you and  
Los Angeles is not too big to govern; you do not have to break it 
up,''' Schockman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some secessionists say the proposed new constitution  
doesn't adequately address their demands. For instance, advocates 
complain that all the city's commuter rail lines are outside the 
Valley and their libraries are neglected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Los Angeles ... is coming to terms with the fact that it is  
too large and better off divided into two smaller more manageable 
units,'' said Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE, a nonprofit 
organization that received approval this week for a study on the 
cost and impact of Valley secession. 
</P>
<P>
	The step -- one of the last before a vote on seceding -- is  
required by a 1996 state law that allows voters to decide without 
city council approval if they want to separate from the city. A 
vote can only occur if the study determines secession would not 
economically hurt either city. 
</P>
<P>
	Valley VOTE is the most successful and organized cityhood  
movement in Los Angeles. As a separate city, its residents would 
number 1.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Retarded Children's Parents File Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For the elderly parents of more than 100,000  
mentally retarded adults across the country, there is no empty 
nest. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of long waiting lists for Medicaid-funded homes and  
day-care programs, many parents -- some in their 60s and 70s -- are 
still taking care of their mostly helpless adult children. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, advocates for the retarded in Massachusetts filed a  
class-action lawsuit in federal court to end the wait. 
</P>
<P>
	They are demanding that the state help 3,000 disabled adults,  
many of whom have waited more than 10 years for a place in a 
program that will take care of them. The plaintiffs are asking for 
an injunction forcing the state to act within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was inspired by a recent federal case in Florida,  
where the state was ordered to help thousands of retarded residents 
immediately or risk losing Medicaid funds, said Boston lawyer Neil 
McKittrick. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are legally entitled to these services and they  
shouldn't have to wait any longer,'' McKittrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	One plaintiff, 61-year-old Christina Anderson of New Bedford,  
said she has waited a decade for a residential program for her 
41-year-old daughter, Valerie, who is retarded, deaf and legally 
blind. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been told repeatedly that her duaghter is ineligible  
because she is not considered a ``crisis'' case with nowhere else 
to turn, Ms. Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against a stone wall,'' the retired factory worker  
said. ``I don't know what my own health needs will be, and I'd like 
to know she will be taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Tummino, assistant commissioner for the state  
Department of Mental Retardation, said the state has earmarked $15 
million a year over the next three years to bring the waiting list 
down from 3,400 in 1997 to 2,700 by next year. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he said, the state will spend more than $50 million  
over six years to eliminate the waiting list for residential and 
day programs for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've done quite well, but I know we have more to  
do,'' Tummino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate action demanded by the federal lawsuit would be  
disruptive and unwieldy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But immediate action is what's needed for the estimated 52,000  
retarded adults who need housing support and 65,000 who need 
daytime or work support programs nationwide, the National 
Association for Retarded Citizens said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're talking about the year 2007,'' said Leo Sarkissian,  
executive director of the Association of Retarded Citizens of 
Massachusetts, who estimated $100 million would be needed to solve 
the state's problem within the next four years. ``What does that 
mean for a caretaker in their 70s?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said increased lobbying across the country is having some  
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to several lawsuits, the Florida Legislature is  
evaluating a $200 million budget proposal to establish more housing 
and programs for the retarded. New York is hammering out a 
five-year, $129 million plan to help 4,900 retarded adults on 
waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in New Jersey and Maryland are also taking closer  
looks at their waiting list problems, McKittrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Ann Boulet, 68, of Sharon said she hopes the Massachusetts  
lawsuit will cut through 15 years of red tape in getting her 
40-year-old son -- who is retarded and needs constant supervision 
for seizures -- into a group home. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son, 6-foot-3 and more than 200 pounds, needs help  
showering, shaving, dressing and communicating with others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're frustrated,'' she said. ``We haven't been able to think  
about our own future at all. People don't really know what it's 
like.''

him, so he fired it up. No one was injured. Fortunately, he was in 
the bathroom by himself. He was highly intoxicated,'' Detective 
Sgt. Michael Ison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond A. Cruz, 49, was arrested after the incident early  
Thursday morning. He was charged with criminal recklessness with a 
handgun, a felony, and resisting law enforcement, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ison said Cruz, who had a permit to carry the handgun, refused  
to surrender his .40-caliber Beretta to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz's blood-alcohol content was 0.18 percent, nearly twice the  
legal driving limit in Indiana, Ison said.

<P>
	Schererville is about 20 miles southeast of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> School Reconsiders Slavery Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- After getting complaints from black  
parents, a school is changing a lesson about slavery in which 
teachers bound students' hands and ankles with rubber bands and had 
them lie side-by-side on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the parents said the program trivialized the grim  
journey of African slaves across the Atlantic and was demeaning to 
blacks, despite its popularity among the eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected the worst,'' said Rhonda Younger, co-president of  
the John Adams African-American Parent Support Group, who refused 
to let her daughter participate in the program last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt emotions can be stirred. And you never know how a  
child will be affected. These were their ancestors, after all,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	During an hourlong lecture and slide show, the students lay on  
the floor and were bound to each other by tying their wrists and 
ankles with rubber bands to simulate the journey of slaves from 
Africa to America, teacher Amy Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	She has taught the lesson the past six years, and this year  
marked the first she received complaints, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to avoid controversy by sending home permission  
slips this time, just to be safe, but it seems like the opposite 
happened,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will be revised next year after discussions with  
parents, said Jerry Kantor, the principal at John Adams Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of the program, Bert Bower, said he would change the  
program so that students are not bound. 
</P>
<P>
	He has received complaints from two other schools in Northern  
California. The lesson was devised by the Teachers' Curriculum 
Institute, which is based in Mountain View, Ca. 
</P>
<P>
	``We find it is inappropriate to bind students during the  
slavery exercise,'' Bower said. ``We made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 300 students who took part said they enjoyed the  
class. Only five of them complained about the program, Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighth-grader Leonard Steed, 13, who is black, said he hoped the  
school would use the same lesson next year because it gave him a 
better sense of what life was like for slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really shouldn't be angry,'' he said near a photo  
display for the program depicting a scarred slave and plantation 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Adams, a history consultant with the California  
Department of Education, said the lesson fails to demonstrate the 
seriousness of historical events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds to me like the school has a misguided sense of  
social empathy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bacteria Said in Mars Meteorites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A pair of Martian meteorites include features  
that resemble Earth bacteria, according to the same NASA 
researchers who three years claimed they had evidence of 
``primitive life on early Mars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, made within the past six months, were from samples  
of a 1.3 billion-year-old meteorite that fell to Earth in 1911 near 
Nakhla, Egypt and a 165 million-year-old meteorite that fell near 
Shergotty, India in 1865. 
</P>
<P>
	``My own opinion is that these will turn out to be true  
micro-fossils from Mars,'' said David S. McKay, a Johnson Space 
Center geologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not counting on getting many converts,'' he said. ``All  
we ask, though, is that people keep an open mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKay's presentation at Houston's JSC for the Lunar and  
Planetary Science Conference on Thursday was a cautious one, since 
more research is required and a mission to get soil samples is 
planned in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay, 62, was one of the researchers who in August 1996  
announced the discovery of tiny fossilized structures in crevices 
of a 4 billion-year-old Mars meteorite found in the Antarctic. The 
meteorite was recovered in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said some of the Nakhla features resembled Earth bacteria  
in a reproductive phase. He also referred to the remains of what 
could have been a slimy ``biofilm'' useful in snaring mineral 
nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be very clear that I have found features which bear  
a striking resemblance to known fossilized life, but we have not 
proven they are fossilized bacteria, nor have we proven they are 
from Mars,'' he said. ``We have to answer those two questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other experts have debated the significance of the NASA team's  
earlier findings. Independent analyses of the Mars rock known as 
Allan Hills 84001 have failed to prove that the potato-sized chunk 
ever contained life. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said the Allan Hills meteorite contained organic  
molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that 
can be associated with life processes. The scientists said they 
found shapes that resemble some forms of fossilized bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In his latest presentation, McKay offered photographic  
comparisons of the fossil-like structures he observed in the Nakhla 
rock and those seen in similar terrestrial formations. The remnants 
found in both meteorites bear a stronger resemblance to bacteria on 
Earth than the structures in the Allan Hills meteorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding water on Mars was a priority of the Mars Polar Lander  
launched earlier this year. Satellite imagery suggests traces of an 
ancient shoreline and NASA's Viking probes of the late 1970s 
revealed major watersheds. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists theorize that the existence of large amounts of  
surface water would enhance the prospects that bacteria once 
developed on Mars. McKay said if bacteria once resided in the much 
younger Nakhla and Shergotty rocks, then life may have persisted on 
Mars through a drastic and still unexplained climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this proves out, we will have shown that life spanned  
almost the entire history of Mars, and presumably today,'' he said. 
``Nothing has happened in the last 165 million years that would 
kill off life on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is why (analysis of the Shergotty sample) is so  
important. If what we see there is borne out as signs of life, that 
pretty well predicts we will find life when we go there.''

<HEADLINE> 13 Arrested in GM Plant Drug Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DORAVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Thirteen employees of a General Motors  
assembly plant have been arrested for allegedly selling drugs to an 
undercover police officer who spent 18 months posing as a 
co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were arrested Thursday and Friday at the plant 12  
miles northeast of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty much caught them by surprise,'' said Doraville  
police Col. Clifford Edwards. ``They had no idea what was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards said the officer gained the trust of employees while  
working among them on the plant's assembly line before purchasing 
cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamines and bootleg whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
	More drugs were found after police dogs searched the cars and  
lockers of GM employees. 
</P>
<P>
	GM cooperated with police, giving the officer a job and  
providing money for him to make drug purchases, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant has about 4,000 workers and assembles four models of  
minivans.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Anticipate Rodman's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers expect Dennis Rodman  
to return to the team shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, with Rodman, there's no guarantee.  
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman John Black told The Associated Press several  
hours before the Lakers faced the Cleveland Cavaliers at Gund Arena 
on Thursday night that Rodman spoke with executive vice president 
Jerry West and general manager Mitch Kupchak earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, he's making some progress taking care of the  
personal business he needs to take care of,'' Black said. ``We 
expect him to rejoin us sometime soon, in the not-too-distant 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game against Cleveland was the first of four in five days  
for the Lakers, who play at Philadelphia tonight, Orlando on Sunday 
and Dallas on Monday night to complete a six-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected Rodman to rejoin the Lakers before the team  
heads home, Black replied, ``That we're not sure of; hopefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black said Rodman continues to be paid for the games he's missed  
-- the game at Cleveland was the third since Rodman told the Lakers 
he needed time off to deal with personal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, coach Kurt Rambis said Rodman will be fined.  
</P>
<P>
	``That will be handled internally,'' was Black's only comment on  
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about what I don't have,'' Rambis said. ``If  
he's here, he's going to be used. If he's not, I can't moan about 
it. It doesn't do me any good. It doesn't do the team any good. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he's at practice, great. When he's at a game, great.  
When's he's not there, I don't let if faze me. I don't let it 
disrupt the team. We just keep moving forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Matt Labov, a spokesman for the Beverly Hills firm of  
Baker-Winokur-Ryder, hired earlier this week as Rodman's publicist, 
said Thursday there was nothing new to report as far as the player 
was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	However, when asked about a report in the Daily News of Los  
Angeles that quoted a source as saying Rodman was in Cancun, 
Mexico, Labov replied, ``That's completely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was also reported earlier in the week that Rodman spent time  
in Las Vegas since the Lakers left Los Angeles without him last 
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Protests Mar Japan PM's Korea Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Japan's prime minister arrived in  
Seoul today for three days of talks expected to focus on North 
Korea's missile threats and suspected nuclear activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests demanding Japan do more to atone for its imperialist  
past in Korea coincided with the start of Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi's visit, which aims in part to put the past behind the two 
countries and work on a new partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi, on his first trip to Korea since becoming the prime  
minister late last year, placed a wreath at the National Cemetery 
in southern Seoul and was scheduled to meet later today with Prime 
Minister Kim Jong-pil. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi will meet Saturday with President Kim Dae-jung, who  
visited Japan in October, in talks Seoul officials said are likely 
to focus on how to deal with North Korea's missile and nuclear 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Korea's national security adviser, Lim Dong-won, told  
journalists that Japan shares South Korea's views on the North. 
``There is little prospect that either side will show any 
differences in dealing with North Korea,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit comes three days after the United States struck an  
agreement with North Korea to permit U.S. inspections of a 
suspected nuclear weapons site in the communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Tokyo, Obuchi reaffirmed Japan's support for the  
agreement and expressed hope that Japan, too, will be allowed to 
take part in the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been concerned after North Korea fired a multistage  
rocket, which flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific last 
summer. North Korea claimed it launched a satellite, but Japan 
called it a test firing of a ballistic missile that could strike 
anywhere in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi and Kim will also follow up on their earlier agreement to  
forge a new partnership between the longtime rivals. In the most 
explicit terms to date, Japan has apologized in writing for its 
harsh colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the government-level efforts, anti-Japanese sentiment is  
still strong among South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We oppose Japan's militarization!'' 30 South Korean activists  
chanted in a downtown park today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southeastern port city of Pusan, 2,000 fishermen planned  
to rally Saturday to demand that South Korea scrap a new fisheries 
treaty with Japan that they say threatens their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-Japanese activist groups also planned a march on the  
Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without atonement for the past, there can be no future  
relationship between Japan and South Korea,'' said Yang Mi-kang, a 
spokeswoman for South Korean women who were forced to serve as 
prostitutes for Japanese soldiers in front-line brothels during 
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Add Receiver Graham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Unrestricted free agent Jeff Graham agreed in  
principle Friday to a one-year, $1.1 million contract with the San 
Diego Chargers, instantly becoming the team's most experienced wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Mitch Frankel said he expects final details to be worked  
out by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham becomes the third veteran to join the Chargers in a  
week's span, following Pittsburgh Steelers free safety Darren Perry 
and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good situation for me,'' said Graham, a solid  
eight-year veteran who hopes to show that his best years aren't 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said the Chargers' new coaching staff had a lot to do  
with his decision. He'll be reunited with offensive coordinator 
Geep Chryst, who was on the Chicago Bears' staff when Graham had 
his two best NFL seasons, 
</P>
<P>
	Head coach Mike Riley and receivers coach Mike Sanford came  
highly recommended from Graham's former New York Jets teammate 
Keyshawn Johnson, who played under Riley and Sanford at Southern 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches ``also looked at it as being a good situation for me  
to get back where I want to be, as far as showing everybody what I 
can do, and not have those questions, `Does this guy still have 
it?''' Graham said Friday evening from his home in Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	His best season was 1995, when he led the Bears with 82 catches  
for 1,301 yards. He signed as a free agent the next season with the 
New York Jets, and he, Johnson and Wayne Chrebet all had 50-plus 
catches. He again shared time in 1997, and was traded to 
Philadelphia during the 1998 draft weekend due to a numbers crunch 
and salary cap reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham started 15 games with Philadelphia last year and led the  
Eagles with 600 receiving yards, was third with 47 catches and had 
two touchdowns. After recording 17 100-yard games in his first 
seven years in the NFL, he had none last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a heck of a receiver,'' general manager Bobby Beathard  
said. ``He's a productive guy that's got a lot left, and we like 
his experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers traded Tony Martin in June because they felt their  
young receivers had developed in the offseason, but found 
themselves looking for veteran help after last year's 5-11 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's leading receiver last year was tight end Freddie  
Jones with 57 catches for 602 yards. The leading wideout was 
Charlie Jones, who caught 46 passes for 699 yards, both career 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers hope to tap Graham's leadership to help develop  
their young wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our group of guys, we don't have a lot of experience  
there except Charlie,'' Beathard said. ``He really is the type of 
guy who can bring them together and give them an idea of what it's 
like to succeed at this level. He should be a great fit.''

<HEADLINE> Differing Opinions on Derivatrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
says financial institutions should be given more incentives to 
better assess the risk of derivatives, but suggested greater 
government oversight is not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks today were in direct contrast to those of  
the outgoing chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 
Brooksley Born, who argued a day earlier that more regulation is 
necessary to prevent a systemic collapse that could affect the U.S. 
and world economies. Both addressed a commodies industry 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Derivatives are often-complex investments that are linked -- or  
derived from -- an underlying asset such as a currency, bond or 
commodity. For example, banks and investors might trade a 
derivative linked to the interest earned on a $100 million bond 
without trading the bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The global derivatives market last year was linked to assets  
with an estimated value of $70 trillion, ``a figure that doubtless 
is closer to $80 trillion this year,'' said Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far the most significant event in finance in the past  
decade has been the extraordinary development and expansion of 
financial derivatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking via satellite, said the free-market approach  
appears most adequate in determining exposure in the rapidly 
growing market despite heavy volatility in the second half of last 
year that shook world financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we approach the 21st century, both banks and nonbanks need  
to continually reassess whether their risk-management practices 
have kept pace with their own evolving activities and with changes 
in financial market dynamics, and readjust accordingly,'' he said. 
``Should they succeed, I am quite confident that market 
participants will continue to increase their reliance on 
derivatives to unbundle risks and thereby enhance the process of 
wealth creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the near-collapse last year of Long-Term Capital  
Management L.P., a hedge fund which held derivatives tied to more 
than $1 trillion in assets, some regulators and politicians have 
called for greater government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	But while lenders suffered record losses in the third quarter of  
1998, chiefly as a result of the collapse of Russia's currency, the 
losses still were well below those suffered by banks on standard 
loans, Greenspan said. And U.S. bank exposure to derivatives last 
year represented $325 billion, or only about 6 percent of their 
total assets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. commercial banks hold about 25 percent of the derivative  
contracts worldwide and U.S. securities houses an additional 15 
percent, according to said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said derivative markets outside formal commodity  
exchanges are functioning effectively without CFTC oversight, 
providing ``a strong argument for development of a less-burdensome 
regime for exchange-traded financial derivatives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Greenspan said many banks have not prepared for the  
worst-case scenario in which investors panic, being content to rely 
now on merely meeting minimum government requirements for capital. 
The risk of potential future exposure during a sudden and 
precipitous downturn must be better-addressed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks were welcome news for the industry. Futures  
exchanges have argued they face regulations that are far more 
stringent that over-the-counter markets, leading to lost business. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, of the $37 trillion in assets linked to the U.S. market  
for derivatives at the end of last year, $4 trillion was 
represented by exchange-traded contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress this year will begin rewriting the Commodities Exchange  
Act, and futures exchanges are hoping lawmakers will sharply relax 
rules that govern them.

<HEADLINE> Sooners, Spartans To Face Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The proud football traditions of Michigan State  
and Oklahoma might show themselves when the two basketball teams 
meet tonight in the semifinals of the NCAA Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams run when the opportunity is there, but otherwise  
they're content to grind away and pound their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Spartans (31-4) have averaged 72.5 points, 13  
more than their opposition. No. 13 seed Oklahoma (22-10) averages 
71 points, its opponents 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson only half-kiddingly says a missed  
shot by Michigan State is like a designed play because the Spartans 
go to the boards so well. They average 18 offensive rebounds per 
game, twice as many as their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have an offense that sometimes is down and dirty, but we  
get the job done,'' said Antonio Smith, Michigan State's leading 
rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans, winners of 20 straight, coasted past College of  
Charleston in the first round of the tournament, then had to rally 
late to beat Mississippi. They have averaged just 64 points in the 
past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no secret that we have not been impressive offensively,  
maybe throughout the year, but especially the last couple of 
weeks,'' coach Tom Izzo said. ``But part of that is the teams we've 
been playing. Some of it has to do with the fact we maybe do not 
have the same weapons like an OU or some other teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans do have an All-American in guard Mateen Cleaves. At  
195 pounds, he's 25 pounds heavier than Oklahoma point guard 
Michael Johnson, which will make him tough to stop. Cleaves isn't a 
great scorer, but he scores important points, as he showed in 
carrying Michigan State past Ole Miss last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched eight games where I thought he was the main reason  
they won at the end,'' Sampson said. ``He has an infectious 
enthusiasm about him. I think it's important for a point guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera brings the same kind of enthusiasm to  
the court. The 6-foot-8 junior can guard the post, but also defend 
on the perimeter, and he can score inside or outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Najera had 17 points and 13 rebounds against Arizona and  
followed that with 20 points and 15 rebounds against North 
Carolina-Charlotte. If the Sooners are to stay with Michigan State, 
they almost certainly will need another big game from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a guy that loves the adulation he's getting,''  
Sampson said. ``As he's matured, he's developed into the player he 
is now. when he's rebounding and aggressive, he can do special 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Michigan State is in the regional semifinals for the  
second straight year, Oklahoma hasn't been this far since 1989. 
They got here by playing outstanding defense, rebounding well and 
shooting effectively from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners made 10 3-pointers in a first-round upset of No. 4  
seed Arizona, then made 13 against North Carolina-Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to shoot a lot more 3s than we do,'' Izzo said.  
``Yet a lot of our styles are similar -- the plays we run, the way 
we check, the way we offensive rebound. I'm looking forward to a 
great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a physical one, although Sampson said his team can't afford  
to get too physical with the bigger and more athletic Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to Joe Frazier them, go toe-to-toe and see  
what happens,'' he said. ``We're going to have to trick them.''

<HEADLINE> Liz Taylor Gown Tops Oscar Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Oscar couture proved to be very lucrative.  
</P>
<P>
	Toymaker Mattel Inc. paid $167,500 for one of Elizabeth Taylor's  
bosom-baring gowns and the Home Shopping Network shelled out 
$79,500 for a Madonna ensemble Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's auction house said the price for Miss Taylor's gown,  
which she wore to the 1969 Oscars, was the second-highest ever for 
a dress at auction, after the $222,500 paid for one of Princess 
Diana's dresses in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of 56 dresses worn to four decades of Academy Awards  
ceremonies brought in $786,120, including premiums. 
``Unforgettable: Fashion of the Oscars'' was a benefit for the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel bought the Taylor gown over the phone. The  
waist-cinching, violet-and-periwinkle gown was designed to call 
attention to a 69.42-carat diamond necklace her then-husband 
Richard Burton had given her. 
</P>
<P>
	She wore the dress, designed by legendary Hollywood costumer  
Edith Head, to introduce best picture nominee ``Midnight Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auctioneer Francois Curiel, deputy chairman of Christie's, said  
Miss Taylor listened to the bidding over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she was very, very pleased,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Madonna had donated the black-and-gray Jean-Paul Gaultier  
ensemble that she wore in 1998 to present the Oscar for best song 
from a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Shopping Network President Mark Bozek said the network  
would use the outfit ``to further awareness of AmFAR.'' He did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	American Movie Classics and its spin off, Romance Classics,  
bought four dresses, including gowns worn by best actress nominee 
Kate Winslet in 1998 and Janet Leigh in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable channels paid $57,500 for the ``Titanic'' star's  
forest green silk crepe Givenchy gown and $34,500 for the silver 
beaded Edith Head evening dress Leigh wore to present two Oscars 
for best screenplay with her husband, Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified buyer spent $17,250 on the outfit actress Cate  
Blanchett is expected to wear at this Sunday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	John Gonzalez and Kevin Kladakis of Tampa, Fla., posed proudly  
with the Prada silk gown worn by Sigourney Weaver to the 1997 
Oscars. They bought it for $4,025. 
</P>
<P>
	``She looked stunning in it,'' recalled Gonzalez, who said he  
and Kladakis planned to display the dress to raise money for AIDS 
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Duke Files for Congressional Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Book tour or congressional campaign?  
It's both for David Duke, who is using stump speeches to hawk his 
new book that calls for separate nations for whites and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is not unique, Duke tells each crowd: ``The father of  
the Republican Party, Abraham Lincoln, also wanted a separate 
nation for African Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is seeking the office held by Bob Livingston, who nearly  
became speaker until he admitted having an extramarital affair and 
resigned in February. The former Ku Klux Klan leader said the 85 
percent white district near New Orleans ``is made for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is running as a Republican even though the GOP has said it  
wants nothing to do with him. Duke becomes the eighth candidate in 
the May 1 contest, an open primary in which candidates of both 
parties run. If no one wins a majority vote, the two top finishers 
meet in a May 29 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a tossup whether his book or his candidacy will be more  
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, 48, is taken seriously -- at least in private -- by  
Democrats and Republicans alike. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Duke ran strong in the 1990 Senate race. And he made  
the runoff in the 1991 governor's race after getting a majority of 
the white vote in the primary election, ultimately losing to Edwin 
Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke did not fare as well in the 1996 Senate race because an  
arch-conservative Republican, Woody Jenkins, drew votes from Duke's 
base, though not enough to beat Democrat Mary Landrieu. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Livingston seat became open, Duke was releasing his book,  
``My Awakening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks are not his only targets in the book.  
</P>
<P>
	The media and Hollywood are controlled by Jews, he says,  
asserting that ``any open-minded reader who reads both Mein Kampf 
and the Talmud would find the Talmud far more intolerant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a luncheon speaking engagement in Baton Rouge recently, Duke  
spoke of ``equal rights for all, but I'm not willing to let my 
country become a third-world nation. We want to live in a Christian 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also tackled illegal immigration and criticized the Postal  
Service for issuing commemorative stamps in January honoring 
Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke will get no help from the GOP even though he is chairman of  
the party committee in his home parish of St. Tammany and a former 
state representative who was active in the GOP legislative caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, all candidates for the seat are Republicans except  
Democratic state Rep. Bill Strain. Duke may not have enough 
political clout to make a runoff, said Bernie Pinsonet, a political 
pollster from Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is a protest vote,'' Pinsonet said. ``Whites voted for  
Duke in 1990 because they saw incumbent Bennett Johnston as a 
(Washington insider) who had lost touch with Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``They voted for him in the 1991 primary for governor because  
they didn't like incumbent Buddy Roemer and hated Edwin Edwards. 
But Edwards won in the runoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, a number of respected candidates in the Republican  
stronghold 1st District are in the race, including Dave Treen, who 
held the congressional seat before Livingston, then became governor 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke insisted he is the man to beat.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let them take their polls and feel comfortable,'' he said.  
``History shows that I always fly below radar in the polls.''

<HEADLINE> AOL May Cut 750 Netscape Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online Inc., moving quickly to swallow  
its newly acquired Netscape unit, reportedly plans to slash up to 
30 percent of the software pioneer's work force, or 750 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts in Netscape's 2,500-workforce could come as soon as  
next week, TheStreet.com online financial news service reported 
Friday, citing unnamed sources close to the company. Netscape's 
employees mostly work at its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes just two days after AOL, the largest provider  
of Internet access and online service, completed its $10 billion 
acquisition to create a new Web giant. Netscape pioneered the first 
widely used software for retrieving Internet information, but was 
forced to sell itself after a bruising business assault by software 
giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Whitney, a spokesman for Dulles, Va.-based AOL, declined to  
comment on the report but said the parent will have ``more 
information next week on how the two companies will operate 
together.'' Netscape spokeswoman Patti Pierson said ``it's totally 
premature to even speculate about layoffs at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But financial analysts have expected AOL to cut parts of  
Netscape's workforce that overlap, such as marketing and public 
relations, and said the reported cuts didn't seem out of line. 
Netscape also could be hit by cuts in divisions that make software 
already made by Sun Microsystems, another partner in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL's stock closed up $3.12 1/2 at $119.25 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Alexander Takes To the Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One 2000 presidential contender has adopted an  
old political strategy to get his message out in the early states. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who is making his  
second bid for the Oval Office, has bought time on one of Iowa's 
largest radio stations to deliver five-minute ``radio addresses'' 
similar to those made weekly and broadcast nationwide by President 
Clinton and the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The addresses, called ``Perspectives by Alexander'' and aired  
each Sunday, are essentially extended ads which focus on one 
political issue or news story. There have been two recorded so far, 
one criticizing the Clinton administration's policy on Iraq and the 
other focusing on ``the advantages of ethanol,'' a big issue in 
corn-rich Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's campaign sees the addresses as an effective way to  
get their message across in a longer format than a normal ad or 
television soundbite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a great opportunity to talk to voters about stories in  
the news and issues that affect them,'' said spokesman Steve 
Schmidt. ``Governor Alexander is actually telling voters what he 
wants to do as president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the ads is several hundred dollars a week in Iowa,  
according to Schmidt, a relatively low price for the statewide 
exposure they offer. Alexander plans to extend the campaign into 
New Hampshire soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander will also give his first big foreign policy speech of  
the 2000 campaign on Tuesday, criticizing Clinton administration 
policies and arguing for increased national defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the world's only superpower, but we haven't been acting  
as one,'' Alexander says in a draft copy of a speech obtained by 
the Associated Press. ``While we are not always comfortable in this 
role, it is ours and will be for quite some time to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also criticizes what he sees as the Clinton  
administration's defense budget shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the heart of the problem is the Clinton-Gore  
administration's lack of willingness to submit to Congress a 
defense budget that is sufficient to get the job done, and done 
right,'' said Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	In the draft speech, Alexander also urges passage of the missile  
defense system bill that the House and Senate approved in differing 
versions this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need a national missile defense system that is geared not  
to the threat of a cloud of nuclear missiles raining down on us, 
but of one missile targeted on one of our cities for the purposes 
of extortion, megalomania, or fanaticism,'' the draft says. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander will also call for greatly expanded protection against  
biological or nuclear attack ``by the terrorist carrying a suitcase 
with vials of nerve gas, biological agents or a nuclear device.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are vulnerable and we must take steps to reduce our  
vulnerability,'' he argues, calling for the stockpiling of 
antibiotics, increased funding and training for responding to such 
attacks and more intelligence gathering to track terrorist groups.

<HEADLINE> Padres Catcher Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres starting catcher Carlos  
Hernandez will be out for the season after undergoing surgery to 
repair his ruptured left Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy said team trainer Todd Hutcheson told him  
the tendon was completely torn. The surgery was performed Thursday 
night by team doctors Jan Fronek and Steven Copp at Scripps Green 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to all go well,'' Bochy said.  
</P>
<P>
	One club official said it'll be six months before Hernandez, 31,  
will be able to do light jogging and squatting exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was injured after hitting a pop fly in San Diego's 7-6  
exhibition win against the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday in 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven seasons as a backup in Los Angeles and one in San  
Diego, Hernandez became the Padres' everyday catcher last year. He 
handled a staff that had the fourth-lowest ERA in the majors, and 
hit .262 with nine homers and 52 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez had several clutch hits in the regular season, then  
hit .325 in the postseason for the NL champion Padres. He led San 
Diego with a .417 average in the division series win against 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rewarded in December with a three-year, $6.5 million  
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the sad thing is, last year he really was able to shed  
that label of just being a backup catcher,'' general manger Kevin 
Towers said from Peoria, Ariz. ``He proved not only to us, but to 
the baseball world, that he's a solid, everyday catcher. It's tough 
when you lose your everyday catcher. He's more than just one of 
your nine. I mean, they're responsible for the success of your 
pitching staff, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres planned to carry three catchers this year, with Jim  
Leyritz and Greg Myers backing up Hernandez, the stronger defensive 
player of the three. Towers said the team will use the final two 
weeks of spring training to decide whether to carry two or three 
catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Top prospect Ben Davis, who had been slated to play at Class AAA  
Las Vegas, could get a shot, but Bochy said Thursday night that it 
might be best if Davis wasn't rushed to the big leagues. Also in 
camp is Mark Parent, 37, who was signed primarily to work with 
Davis in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have to carry three,'' said Towers, who added that  
the Padres could go with two catchers and then carry an extra 
pitcher or outfielder. But Leyritz, who is Sterling Hitchcock's 
personal catcher, also backs up Wally Joyner at first base, and the 
Padres could leave themselves a little bare if they go with just 
two catchers.

like a ``meat grinder.'' The bomb exploded in downtown Vladikavkaz, 
the regional capital of North Ossetia, which borders the breakaway 
region of Chechnya. The blast raked the busy market, shattering 
stalls and vehicles. Police officers in Vladikavkaz put the death 
toll at 50 with more than 100 injured. The region is close to 
Chechnya, which claimed independence from Russia after a 1994-96

Association conference, says more than two-thirds of the 50 
G-rated, animated films released by major studios during the past

8, but didn't like the mood brought on by the allegations that Salt 
Lake organizers provided $1 million in cash, scholarships and gifts 
to IOC members to win the event. SLOC president Mitt Romney said 
the mascot ``embodies the spirit of the American West and Utah.'' 
The SLOC expects $52 million in revenue from licensed products, a 
big chunk of which are clothes, trinkets, pins and toys bearing the 
image of the mascot.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Orders Oil Paint Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The Forest Service today ordered an end to the  
use of oil-based paint to mark trees for logging after workers 
blamed the paint on an increase in miscarriages and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	The order, effective May 15, comes a week after a worker  
advocacy group filed a lawsuit in Washington D.C. seeking an 
injunction to ban the use of the paint. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was reached despite objections from within the  
agency, including an offer from the chairman of the Forest 
Service's paint committee to resign in protest, according to 
internal memos obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This direction is necessary because of the uncertainty  
regarding safety to employees,'' Phil Janik, the Forest Service's 
chief operating officer, said in a memo Friday to all regional 
foresters and station directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Garrett, the paint committee chairman and an engineer at  
the agency's research center in San Dimas, Calif., believes the 
paint is safe. Garrett did not return telephone messages at his 
office on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move drew a skeptical response from the head of the group  
that filed the lawsuit accusing the agency of using the paint 
illegally for years without conducting an environmental impact 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a decade of broken promises from the Forest Service  
on tree paint,'' said Andy Stahl, executive director of the 
Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. 
Stahl said he's not dropping the lawsuit.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Move to Sunday Night </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Never on Sunday for Oscar, the film industry  
said for 46 years. Too risky to air the Academy Awards on the 
weekend, when people should be buying movie tickets instead of 
enjoying a free TV show. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chance to shore up TV ratings -- and a growing  
appreciation of the Academy Awards as an unparalleled promotional 
tool for Hollywood -- finally caused a reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
	When host Whoopi Goldberg steps on stage at 8:30 p.m. EST  
Sunday, ABC and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences 
hope that the weekend broadcast will be the start of a new 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great move,'' said Gil Cates, who is producing his  
ninth Oscar ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday is a festive day, a day of relaxation. It's a non-work  
day, and I think that comports well with what Oscar should be,'' he 
said. ``The whole phenomenon of folks rushing home from work to 
watch the show is going to be avoided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Oscar ratings rise and fall, the ceremony is  
television's second most-watched event after the Super Bowl. 
Commercial rates reportedly have reached $1 million for a 30-second 
spot, up from around $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But the show is lacking a hit centerpiece like last year's  
``Titanic.'' Some of the nominees are in films largely unseen by 
moviegoers, such as best actor contenders Nick Nolte in 
``Affliction'' or Edward Norton in ``American History X.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a blockbuster date, Oscar can be relatively unpopular.  
The 1997 ceremony, at which the highbrow film ``The English 
Patient'' dominated, had the second-worst ratings on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Although no one is expecting the ceremony to match the 1998  
numbers, the best in 15 years, ABC is counting on the move from the 
show's longtime Monday berth and a half-hour earlier starting time 
to avoid a big deflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sunday has the highest 'HUT' level of the week, more  
'households using television' than any other night,'' noted Michael 
Davies, ABC executive vice president in charge of specials. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier start ensures the ceremony will end at a reasonable  
hour, a ratings plus. Viewership tends to plummet when the Oscars 
stretch into the midnight hour on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The star quotient, of course, remains unchanged. Harrison Ford,  
Jack Nicholson, Denzel Washington, Kim Basinger, John Travolta, 
Annette Bening, Andy Garcia and Helen Hunt are among the 
presenters. 
</P>
<P>
	The performers are Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli, Whitney Houston,  
Mariah Carey, Randy Newman, Peter Gabriel, Allison Moorer and 
Aerosmith. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar winner Geena Davis (``The Accidental Tourist,'' 1988) will  
be host of an academy first: an exclusive pre-ceremony show 
beginning at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to attempt to give the audience a backstage pass  
and look at everything that goes into making the Oscar ceremony,'' 
said Davis. That includes clips of events leading up to the 
ceremony, such as the nominees' luncheon, and, of course, the 
fashion parade of arriving stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said she immediately said yes to the job. ``I've always  
been a fan not only of the Oscars but of the excitement, and 
arrivals have always been a big part,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony itself will celebrate the waning century, Cates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inasmuch as film is a child of the 20th century and made its  
impact in the century, we're going to reflect on that,'' he said, 
including a look at what film's role might be in the next 100 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	One era will loom especially large because of an honorary award  
being given to director Elia Kazan, whose critically acclaimed 
films include ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Gentleman's Agreement.'' 
Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are presenting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, Kazan drew fire by giving the names of colleagues  
to the House Un-American Activities Committee investigating 
communist infiltration in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the passage of time, the award has divided the industry.  
``Age and ability in the arts or anything else, in my opinion, does 
not excuse a crime,'' said actor Rod Steiger, star of ``On the 
Waterfront.'' Actor Karl Malden was the member of the Academy's 
board who proposed the lifetime achievement award for Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, veteran Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd, citing  
the controversy, wrote in the trade paper's March 10 issue: ``I'm 
just one who will still remain seated during that honorary Oscar 
presentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Cates: ``I think Army Archerd is dead wrong in his attitude  
toward Kazan. I think the academy is absolutely correct in honoring 
Kazan. He's a great director. ... I think the majority of the 
audience is delighted with that honorary Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging there are those who will refuse to applaud Kazan,  
Cates said: ``We'll show all.'' There will be no ``sweetening'' if 
the applause is scant or attempt to mask any boos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	OSCAR, CONTINUED: There's lots of Oscar to go around. Bill  
Maher's hourlong ``Politically Incorrect After Party,'' whose 
guests include Rod Steiger and William H. Macy, will follow the 
Academy Awards by a half-hour on ABC. The Oscar feast at E! 
Entertainment Television begins at noon EST Sunday with the 
six-hour ``E! Live Countdown to the Academy Awards '99.'' It 
continues with Joan and Melissa Rivers' arrivals coverage from 6-8 
p.m. EST and wraps with a midnight post-show.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Rider Suspended for Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers guard Isaiah Rider  
was suspended for Friday night's game for kneeing and shoving 
Sacramento's Jon Barry in Thursday night's victory over the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was announced Friday by NBA senior vice president  
of basketball operations Rod Thorn. Rider was forced to miss Friday 
night's game against the San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension cost him more than $29,000 in salary. Rider also  
was fined $7,500 for the incident, which occurred in the second 
quarter of the Blazers' 88-78 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry had fallen on the floor, and Rider walked by and kneed him  
in the head. Barry jumped up and ran over to Rider, waving a finger 
in his face and exchanging words. Rider then shoved a forearm in 
Barry's face, and players had to separate them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was assessed a technical foul, but was not ejected. He  
later scored eight points in the fourth quarter to help the Blazers 
pull away. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider said later that the bad blood between the two that began  
last year when Barry, then with the Los Angeles Lakers, was 
taunting Rider from the bench during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider did not start the game because he was late for the team  
shootaround. He also was suspended earlier this season for one game 
and fined $2,500 for leaving the bench during an altercation at 
Charlotte on Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was suspended for seven games last season, including three  
games by the league for spitting at a heckler in Detroit and one 
game by the Blazers for walking out on the team during a victory 
over the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Kisses 10,000 Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It would be hard to find a much better launching  
pad for 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average teased investors Thursday with  
a late bid at history, bobbing above 10,000 six separate times in 
the final 10 minutes of trading, only to creep back below and 
finish just 2.68 points beneath the vaunted milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	Lost in the disappointment was another new high for the Dow,  
which rose 118.12 points for the day to close at a record 9,997.62. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 also closed at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow crossed 10,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday  
morning, but pulled back after about a minute and closed with a 
loss. Thursday's high was 10,001.51, a shade below Tuesday's high 
of 10,001.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's last-minute flirtation with 10,000 sparked some  
confusion at the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where 
NYSE Chairman Richard A. Grasso and Dow Jones &AMP; Co. chief executive 
Peter Kann began celebrating too soon -- flinging baseball caps 
emblazoned with the words ``Dow 10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow is now up 800 points, or nearly 9 percent, in 1999 --  
well on the way to what would be an unprecedented fifth straight 
year with a gain of at least 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While just a number, 10,000 would mark a crowning achievement  
for a resilient bull market that began more than eight years ago, 
on Oct. 11, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has more than quadrupled since that time, driven by an  
extraordinary combination of positive factors, especially tame 
inflation, low interest rates, and a confident mood that has 
consumers buying everything from stocks to socks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main spark for Thursday's advance was a report that consumer  
prices rose a tiny 0.1 percent last month -- further confirmation 
that inflation remains in check and that the Federal Reserve is 
unlikely to raise interest rates to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing perception that the world's economic trouble spots are  
recovering has provided some extra fuel in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, investors were unfazed Thursday by a separate report  
from the Commerce Department showing that the nation's trade 
deficit shot up 21 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> Carbon Monoxide Alarms Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- One million carbon monoxide alarms are  
being recalled because the devices sometimes give inaccurate 
readings, the manufacturer and federal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary recall involves 650,000 Nighthawk alarms and  
350,000 Lifesaver models made by Kidde Safety Co. Both alarms are 
sold across the United States and Canada. Lifesavers are also sold 
in the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	Packaging around the units sometimes distorts readings of  
carbon-monoxide levels, the company and the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission said. There have been no reports of injuries involving 
the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorless, odorless and tasteless, lethal carbon monoxide gas is  
produced by the incomplete combustion of a fossil fuel. While it 
can kill at any time, the gas is most dangerous during fall and 
winter, when homes have less ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials detected the problem during field tests.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nighthawk units involved in the recall were manufactured  
between Nov. 8, 1998, and March 9, 1999, as listed on the back of 
each unit. ``NIGHTHAWK'' and ``Carbon Monoxide Alarm'' are on the 
front of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lifesaver units are models 9CO-1 and 9CO-1C, manufactured  
between June 1, 1997, and Jan. 31, 1998. The manufacturing date is 
on the back of the unit. ``LIFESAVER'' and ``Carbon Monoxide 
Detector'' appear on the front. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can participate in the recall by logging onto the  
company's Web site, www.kidde.com, or by calling the company. 
Models will be repaired.

<HEADLINE> Foley Ready To Join Seahawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- New York Jets quarterback Glenn Foley, who lost  
his job last season to Vinny Testaverde, is set to join Seattle in 
a trade that will cost the Seahawks a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today the Jets will get  
Seattle's sixth-round choice in the 2000 draft -- a pick that could 
be upgraded depending on Foley's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still talking,'' Seahawks spokesman Dave Pearson said  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley agreed Thursday to a two-year deal with the Jets worth $2  
million to $2.5 million, and he will bring that contract to 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	He had one year remaining on his contract with New York, and was  
to make $1.2 million in base salary and $400,000 in workout 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks hope he'll sign for more than a year and for less  
than the $2 million he would have counted against the Jets' salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, 28 and a seventh-round draft choice out of Boston  
College, will back up and perhaps challenge Seattle's starting 
quarterback, Jon Kitna. In New York, he started eight games in five 
seasons and is 1-7 as a starter. He lost each of his three '98 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	New Seattle coach Mike Holmgren also is expected to pick a  
quarterback in the April NFL draft -- perhaps using the team's 
first-round selection, 17th overall.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Plans To Buy Purple Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. plans to buy Purple Moon,  
a failed company that pioneered CD-ROM games for preteen girls 
stressing themes of friendship and gentle adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Purple Moon's characters will join Barbie under the giant  
toymaker's Mattel Media unit. Terms were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of Purple Moon is part of Mattel's passion for  
bringing girls to the computer, which we started in 1996 with the 
launch of our Barbie Fashion Designer CD-ROM,'' Mattel Media 
President David Haddad said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Purple Moon and its Rockett brand are known for their  
relevance in girls' lives and will further strengthen our 
relationship with girls and our presence in software and 
technology,'' Haddad said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased that Mattel plans to acquire our  
company,'' said Nancy Deyo, Purple Moon's president and chief 
executive. ``Brand building is what Mattel knows best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain View-based Purple Moon was started in 1996. The  
company, which had about 40 employees, focused on games, a Web site 
and related merchandise for girls ages eight to 12. It drew 
considerable attention because of its backing by billionaire 
Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of shoot-'em-ups and violent computer fare, Purple Moon  
offered relationship-based titles such as ``Rockett's New School,'' 
about a young girl's efforts to make friends in new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company couldn't compete with splashier girls' titles,  
such as Mattel's Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the company shut down and laid off all of its  
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with Mattel was in the works before the shutdown, Deyo  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haddad said Mattel will consider hiring some of Purple Moon  
workers. Deyo will become an adviser to Mattel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel will acquire the rights to Purple Moon's characters and  
its ``Rockett'', ``Secret Paths'' and ``Starfire Soccer'' series of 
games, along with its Web site and merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel plans to expand the franchises by launching a ``Rockett's  
World'' book series later this year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel stock rose $2.50 per share to close at $25.06 Thursday on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Wood Caught Urinating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- When nature calls, sometimes it just can't wait.  
</P>
<P>
	At least, that was Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood's defense  
when two Scottsdale police officers caught him and a friend 
urinating against a parking lot wall on Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't stop now. I have to finish,'' Wood told the police  
officers, who caught him at approximately 1:10 a.m. behind a strip 
of businesses and night clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Brian Brown said Wood's demeanor was ``cooperative.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Walker, a minor league pitcher with the San Diego Padres,  
was also caught in the act. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Jennifer Clair described Walker as intoxicated and  
sarcastic, but still cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
	The police report didn't indicate where Wood and Walker were  
before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year, missed his  
original court date of Feb. 23, causing Judge Joseph Olcavage to 
issue a warrant for his arrest. Wood has since taken care of the 
citation, paying a $90 fine and pleading guilty during his 
rescheduled court date of March 12, said a representative of the 
Scottsdale Municipal Court on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs spokeswoman Sharon Pannozzo said the team has no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Wood tore a ligament in his right elbow Saturday and won't be  
able to play this season for the Cubs, who are currently training 
in nearby Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 22, also missed his court date and the warrant for his  
arrest is still outstanding. Padres spokesman John Dever said he 
knew nothing about the incident. The Padres' spring training is 
based in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Scott Reed said hundreds of public urination arrests are  
made each year in the same area of Scottsdale.

<HEADLINE> Matt Morris Has Elbow Sprain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Matt Morris  
has a sprained elbow on his throwing arm, and team officials aren't 
sure if he'll be ready for the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris returned to St. Louis on Thursday from the Cardinals  
spring training camp in Jupiter, Fla., for a magnetic resonance 
imaging exam. 
</P>
<P>
	Though more tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis, team  
physician George Paletta said Friday the exam revealed the sprain, 
along with strain on the muscle around the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals spokesman Brian Bartow said officials have not  
determined how long Morris will be out. But the results of the exam 
were disheartening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the news they wanted to see. They were hoping it was  
just typical stiffness or tightness after the first spring 
appearance,'' Bartow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris has been bothered by arm stiffness all spring. He pitched  
for the first time Wednesday, throwing two scoreless innings. But 
afterwards, his arm hurt, causing concern about his readiness for 
the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time obviously is growing short with him having just the one  
game appearance,'' Bartow said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, 24, is being counted on as the Cardinals' top pitcher  
this season. In two major league seasons, Morris is 19-14 with a 
2.97 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	He made just one start last season before the All-Star break  
because of a strained right shoulder, but finished 7-5 with a 2.53 
ERA.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Sees Politics Behind Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal and state officials are separately  
investigating the New York Police Department after a congressman 
asked them to focus on ``stop and frisk'' practices by a unit that 
includes four officers who fatally shot an unarmed immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, said  
the investigations appeared to have more to do with Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's desire to run for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's seat 
than wrongdoing by the NYPD. Giuliani, a Republican, is also a 
potential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of this is very curious,'' Ms. Roche said in The  
New York Times. '' We just hope that all of the Clinton 
administration officials and Democratic Attorney General (Eliot) 
Spitzer don't bump into each other as they rush to conduct their 
investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor said Thursday he welcomed Spitzer's investigation, and  
Deputy Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode said the NYPD would 
cooperate with the federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this investigation is conducted fairly, it will demonstrate  
that the NYPD is truly one of the most restrained police forces in 
the country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, elected as state attorney general last year, said the  
inquiry is not in response to any one incident -- not even the 
shooting of Amadou Diallo by four officers Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators will look into police training ``and the  
lack of sensitivity to the diverse cultures, languages and needs of 
the city's immigrant groups,'' Rep. Jose Serrano said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano asked federal prosecutors, who already are working with  
the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn probing police tactics, to look into 
the Street Crime Unit's ``stop and frisk'' practices.

	The NYPD's patrol guide states that a police officer can stop  
someone if he reasonably suspects the person has committed or is 
about to commit a crime. The officer can frisk a person if he 
reasonably suspects he is in danger of being physically hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide lists several factors that could constitute reasonable  
suspicion, such as a person's demeanor; any knowledge the officer 
has about a person's background or character; any bulges in his 
clothing; the time of day; the particular streets involved; and the 
proximity to a crime scene.

<P>
	Improper searches are a common complaint made to the Civilian  
Complaint Review Board, which investigates alleged police 
misconduct. Last year, there were 565 such complaints, a 6 percent 
increase over 1997, when there were 531 complaints.

	Also on Thursday, Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National

<P>
	It was the eighth day this month of such protests at police  
headquarters. A total of 148 people have been arrested at the 
Diallo protests, including former Mayor David Dinkins and Reps.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Worry May Bring 3-Day NBA Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The NBA is being cautious with Y2K, leaning toward a three-day  
break when 1999 becomes 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, our inclination is to not schedule games December  
31, January 1 or January 2, given the unusual circumstances that 
the changeover to the year 2000 may or may not bring,'' league 
spokesman Chris Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K, as it has become known, refers to anticipated disruptions  
caused by computer codes that cannot handle the transition to the 
year 2000. Many computers were originally programmed to recognize 
only the last two digits of a year and will not work properly at 
the turn of the century when machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	With some Y2K forecasters predicting trouble for the airline  
industry, the NBA may protect itself by giving teams the three-day 
break. The schedule would resume Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of putting the schedule together is far from  
complete, but that's the way we're leaning right now,'' Brienza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The break wouldn't be all that different. The NBA normally  
doesn't schedule many games on Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Last season and 
on this season's original schedule, there was one game slated for 
each night. In 1996-97, there were no games either day. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PRACTICE, SHMACTICE:* Whoever said practice makes perfect  
forgot to tell Chuck Daly. 
</P>
<P>
	While other coaches complain about the lack of practice time in  
this hectic 50-game season, the coach of the Orlando Magic has 
decided to virtually do away with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do most of our work on shootaround days, and we've had  
enough injuries that we couldn't even run a practice if we wanted 
to,'' Daly said. ``We're a 2 a.m. team. We get home from most of 
these cities at 2 a.m., we don't get to sleep until 3 or 3:30 a.m., 
so it would be foolish to practice the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not halfway through the season yet, and it's been weird  
and going to get weirder. I don't think anybody had any idea of 
what all these games would mean to franchises before it's over. 
We've seen considerable injuries, and we'll see more. And the 
fatigue is showing. Some nights teams don't have any gas left, and 
that's why we're seeing them put only 50 or 60 points on the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's no-practice practice is a big hit in the Magic locker  
room, where the players don't look sleepy and overworked as players 
on the other 28 teams do. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we have are team meetings and walk-throughs in which we  
don't walk,'' center Danny Schayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the strategy has worked. The Magic entered the weekend  
with an 18-7 record, second-best in the Eastern Conference behind 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GEORGE VS. WALLY:* The league came down hard on Bucks coach  
George Karl for calling Seattle general manager Wally Walker 
``incompetent'' when the Sonics traveled to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The $25,000 fine matched the largest ever given to a coach.  
</P>
<P>
	Players and coaches are bound by NBA contracts to refrain from  
excessive disparagement of teams and the league, and Karl had 
already had his allotment of Wally-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get his attention. This was not the first time  
the guy has been warned,'' league vice president Rod Thorn said. 
``We're talking about a recidivist here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KANDI MAN:* Michael Olowokandi, the overall No. 1 pick in last  
year's draft, is coming along slowly for the dreadful Los Angeles 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just say it's not the best of situations, but it's my  
challenge,'' he said. ``And I have to face that challenge head on 
rather than sit back and wish a good team had drafted me. Whether 
it's a good team or bad team, that's a measure of what kind of a 
competitor you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi is averaging only 9.0 points and 6.6 rebounds for the  
Clippers, the worst team in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big old learning curve. It's a different game. Coming  
out of college, I thought with my quickness I could come here and 
finesse my way around, but I can't get away with that,'' he said. 
``Coach keeps insisting I get physical, that's what does the 
trick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi is still waiting to be paid for his short stint in  
the Euro league, where he played for Kinder Bologna earlier this 
year before joining the Clippers late in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent, Bill Duffy, said late paychecks are a fact of life  
with European teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to do it all over again, I probably would have done  
the same thing given the information I had back then,'' said 
Olowokandi, who signed in Italy when it looked like the lockout 
might force the cancellation of the entire season. ``But if I knew 
the season was going to start, I don't think I would have done 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LAYUPS:* Vin Baker of Seattle fired his agent, David Falk, and  
may sign with Gary Payton's agent, Aaron Goodwin. There's also talk 
that Baker, like Ray Allen and Grant Hill, might look for a lawyer 
to work on an hourly basis to handle his next contract. He will be 
a free agent at the end of the season. ... Brent Barry of Chicago 
missed one free throw but hit the second to give the Bulls 100 
points, meaning fans got free tacos. ``I've never felt so much 
pressure trying to make a free throw and feed 20,000 people. Now I 
know how Jesus felt with the loaves and fishes.'' ... Michael 
Jordan, at a golf event in Florida, said he has not picked up a 
basketball since hitting the final shot of his career in Utah last 
June. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see Phil Jackson back 
coaching in the NBA next season. ... Chris Dudley, one of the worst 
foul shooters in the league, went into the weekend with a streak of 
nine successful free throws in a row. Dudley has gotten rid of the 
pronounced hitch in his release. ``Don't jinx me,'' Dudley said 
before explaining his new foul-line attitude. ``I feel confident 
and comfortable out there. Just trying to be more fluid. I didn't 
always know I was hitching.'' ... Rookie Brian Skinner of the Los 
Angeles Clippers is a dead ringer for Kobe Bryant of the crosstown 
Lakers. ``I've heard it a lot. A lot of people think I'm Kobe. I 
hear it from people on the street, everybody I meet, period. I 
pretty much say it before they say it.''

<HEADLINE> Espionage at Other Labs Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he knows of no alleged  
espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons labs during his administration, 
but government officials are looking into at least two cases that 
may involve security breaches on his watch. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Friday, Clinton said his administration  
responded quickly to close security gaps after it learned of 
alleged espionage that occurred in the late 1980s. He has 
repeatedly emphasized that those incidents -- if they indeed 
occurred -- date to the Reagan administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me  
about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the labs 
during my presidency,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main focus is on a case involving a Taiwanese-born scientist  
who worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and was 
suspected of leaking information about the W-88 nuclear warhead to 
China during the Reagan administration. He was fired this month but 
has not been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Energy Department is reviewing whether scientists at  
other U.S nuclear weapons labs may have disclosed sensitive neutron 
bomb and electromagnetic pulse technology to China, several 
government officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, cautioned  
that many of the incidents being examined may never result in 
criminal charges and many allegations have already been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	In closed-door briefings on Capitol Hill over the past week, key  
lawmakers were told of the expanding investigations, including one 
case of suspected espionage at the Argonne National Laboratory, 
which has facilities in Illinois and Idaho, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional sources said the Argonne probe involves the  
possible disclosure to China of neutron bomb technology by an 
Asian-American scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argonne case involves a nuclear lab safety expert who does  
not work on weapons technology, and federal law enforcement 
investigators found no evidence of espionage, according to two 
senior law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The separate allegation that electromagnetic pulse technology  
was given to China also collapsed when investigated, a senior law 
enforcement official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the law enforcement community there is sharp skepticism  
about the seriousness of the emerging cases. Officials said the 
only serious case to arise from a welter of allegations was the Los 
Alamos matter. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior law enforcement official said the Energy Department  
has referred dozens of tips to the FBI about possible security 
lapses, but ``99.9 percent of them turn out not to be criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional officials said the Argonne case is believed to  
have begun before Clinton took office, but investigators are 
checking into whether the loss of sensitive data may have continued 
into his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, sharply critical of Clinton's response to the Los  
Alamos case from the 1980s, are eager to find examples of alleged 
espionage during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference, Clinton also rejected accusations by GOP  
critics that he was slow to respond to the Chinese espionage 
allegations because of campaign contributions allegedly flowing 
from Asian sources to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can say categorically that it never crossed my mind that I  
should not disclose some inquiry being undertaken by the United 
States government for reasons of commercial or other gain. That is 
not true,'' the president said. ``If we think we have got a 
security problem, we ought to fix it.'' He added: ``Plainly, the 
security was too lax for years and years and years at the labs. And 
a lot of important changes have been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has repeatedly denied any spying at the nuclear labs.  
</P>
<P>
	One senior congressional official said the unidentified Argonne  
employee has been under clandestine monitoring as 
counterintelligence officials try to develop their suspicions into 
a solid case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argonne lab, oldest of the nation's nuclear research  
facilities, is primarily devoted to pure scientific research. But 
weapons labs such as Sandia and Los Alamos conduct weapons-related 
work at Argonne facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab is run by the University of Chicago under contract with  
the Department of Energy. The research center is about 25 miles 
southwest of Chicago, but some of its key research infrastructure, 
including a neutron accelerator, is at a site in the Snake River 
Valley west of Idaho Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	The neutron bomb, developed and deployed late in the Cold War,  
was designed to kill enemy forces and knock out electronics without 
doing extensive physical damage or creating an overwhelming fallout 
cloud. The weapons are no longer deployed.

<HEADLINE> The Loudest Theatrical Nightmare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Grating and unnerving, a nightmarish funhouse  
accompanied by megawatt screeching. ``Betty's Summer Vacation'' is 
the theatrical equivalent of scraping your nails across a 
blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Durang's comedy, on view at off-Broadway's  
Playwrights Horizons, tries very hard to upend its audience. It 
succeeds. Get out the aspirin, preferably extra strength, if you 
plan on staying through to its surprisingly lame ending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Betty's Summer Vacation'' starts out promisingly. The setting  
is a cheerful if generic beach house, where two giggly women -- the 
sweet title character and a motor mouth named Trudy -- are the first 
arrivals for summer fun. 
</P>
<P>
	They soon are joined by a secretive, sensitive young man who may  
or may not be a serial killer; a buffed, narcissistic fellow whose 
libido won't quit, and the owner of the vacation house, a talkative 
woman who turns out to be Trudy's mother. Ma eventually picks up a 
dirty old derelict, whose demise sets much of the evening's madness 
in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	Durang's initial banter is fun. Plugged into every nuance of pop  
culture, the playwright skewers today's tacky tabloid mentality 
where the only rule seems to be: How low can you go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Betty'' goes pretty low, accompanied by an irritating laugh  
track that giggles or guffaws at all the terrible jokes, 
underlining just how awful they are. 
</P>
<P>
	This laugh track, provided by three actors listed in the theater  
program as voices one, two and three -- is remarkably unfunny, but 
Durang and director Nicholas Martin persist in using it throughout 
the evening. In Act 2, they even bring the voices on stage in a 
desperate attempt to camouflage the fact that the plot has 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
	Just exactly what is the plot? Not much, a series of comic riffs  
about incest, child abuse, genital dismemberment and more, that 
initially play effectively because of the topnotch comic actors the 
production employs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among these clowns is Kristine Nielsen, who plays Trudy's  
demented mother with a ferocity that is mesmerizing. As Betty, 
Kellie Overbey delivers the loudest screams on or off-Broadway. 
Troy Sostillio has testosterone to spare as the self-absorbed stud 
and Julie Lund babbles charmingly as the abused Trudy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Betty's Summer Vacation'' is one weird play, an alienating  
farce that grows increasingly unlikable as its story evaporates 
into oddness.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Addresses Privacy Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is offering two free software  
programs on its Internet site to strip out an identifying number 
that could be used to trace the authorship of some electronic 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	One program is a small patch to repair the problem and prevent  
the number from being planted in such documents. The second removes 
the number from existing documents. Both were made available 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft confirmed earlier this month that its latest version  
of Windows generates a unique serial number for each computer. That 
number partly is planted within some documents created with its 
popular collection of Office 97 business programs, which include 
Word and Excel. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers are part of a 32-digit identifier created by  
Windows 98 whenever customers register their software with 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company also acknowledged it may have been  
collecting those serial numbers from customers -- along with names 
and addresses -- even when customers explicitly had indicated they 
did not want the numbers disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft denied it ever used the serial number together with  
its customer lists to track documents. But privacy groups 
complained that it made it technically possible for the company to 
trace documents to a specific computer even when an author wished 
to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said the numbers originally were used to support a  
feature -- never fully developed -- to ``link'' documents on the 
Internet or an internal computer network. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also promised to purge any serial numbers it may have  
gathered when customers registered their Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is falling under some scrutiny over the controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a privacy advocate, filed a  
formal complaint with Trust-E of Palo Alto, Calif., which agrees to 
regulate a company's Internet privacy policies in exchange for a 
seal of approval to reassure customers online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Microsoft is a corporate partner with Trust-E and pays it  
$100,000 annually, putting the organization in the uncomfortable 
position of being asked to investigate a possible privacy violation 
by one of its largest benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust-E said it would decide today whether an investigation was  
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, the Swedish Computer Inspectorate is considering a  
request to investigate whether Microsoft violated tough new privacy 
laws there. 
</P>
<P>
	Those laws, now the subject of negotiations with the U.S.  
Commerce Department, prohibit the transfer of personal information 
about citizens to any country outside the European Union unless the 
citizens consent to the disclosure. 
</P>
