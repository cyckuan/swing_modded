<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ Officials in southern China's Guangdong province
have suspended 15 futures trading companies from accepting new
clients and ordered the companies to close all positions and return
all margin deposits to clients by December 31, 1998, the Shenzhen
Securities Times reported Friday.
	   The suspensions were the latest move in a clean up of the
China's fledgling financial futures markets.
	   The Guangdong Securities Regulatory Commission demanded complete
records of futures trading positions and use of investors' funds as
well as a plan to cover positions and return margin requirements to
investors, the newspaper reported.
	   Names of the companies under investigation were not disclosed.
	   In August, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced
plans to merge China's 14 futures exchanges into three and close
all but 12 of China's 35 futures contracts. The CSRC has also shut
down a number of futures brokerages for trading irregularities and
misappropriation of funds.
	   Conflicts between investors and closed futures brokerages have
erupted, sparking protests in Shenzhen and Beijing by investors who
failed to recover their money from companies that had shut down.

	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ Richie Hearn and Mark
Blundell put their left racing gloves on first, while Christian
Fittipaldi always gets into the car from the right-hand side.
Superstitions appear to play a big role in how some Australian
IndyCarnival drivers prepare for races.
	   ``I always put my left glove on first and get into the car on
the left side because I'm worried about what might happen if I
don't,'' Hearn said Friday as he prepared for Sunday's race on the
Surfers Paradise street circuit.
	   Bryan Herta always makes certain his shoelaces are tied straight
_ ``never twisted'' _ while Al Unser Jr., avoids green pens before
races in case bad vibes rub off on his performance.
	   Paul Tracy admits to putting his clothes on in the same order
before every race, while rookie Tony Kanaan takes the issue a step
further _ ``I wear the same underwear in every race and every
Sunday I put my left shoe on first.''
	   - - -
	   Everything appears to be OK with Team KOOL Green owner Barry
Green and his Canadian driver Paul Tracy following an altercation
at the Texaco Grand Prix in Houston, Texas two weeks ago.
	   Green and Tracy were involved in a pit incident in which Green,
upset that Tracy had tried to pass teammate and eventual winner
Dario Franchitti halfway through the Houston race, shouted at Tracy
and pulled the driver's shirt.
	   The two had to be separated by a team member. Tracy had come out
of the race after bumping wheels with Franchitti and hitting the
wall.
	   ``We were very competitive at the last race in Houston and I'm
glad to say that Barry and I have put our differences behind us,''
Tracy was quoted as saying in a team press release.
	   Tracy and Green arrived Down Under US dlrs 5,000 poorer after
each being fined by CART for ``physical contact and not maintaining
proper behavior and sportsmanship.''
	   Team KOOL has a good chance of doing well in Australia _ Tracy
won here in 1995 and Franchitti is the in-form driver on the
circuit, winning three of his last four races.
	   - - -
	   A proposal to shift the location of the Gold Coast race from the
temporary street circuit in Surfers Paradise to a permanent site in
nearby Southport is opposed by 1994 race winner Michael Andretti
and Australian team owner Barry Green.
	   ``I'd be disappointed because this is a good race track,''
Andretti said. ``I think all the drivers like this track.''
	   Green said that while there are some advantages to a permanent
site, the Surfers Paradise track was a major attraction of the race
for international television audiences.
	   ``We'd like to see the race stay right in the city,'' said
Green. ``It has certainly done wonders for the area, and the race
has a big following.''
	   The 12-turn track winds its way around highrises, takeout
chicken outlets and a long straight runs parallel to the ocean
beach. In several areas the track's concrete barriers are set up
less than 10 metres from apartment or hotel swimming pools. (djp)

Tension remains high between Aborigines and government over
</HEADLINE>
reconciliation &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard's promise to
improve his government's relations with Australia's Aborigines
faltered Friday when he again refused to offer a national apology
to thousands of people taken from their families as children.
	   In his victory speech following national elections on Oct. 3,
Howard sought to repair his conservative government's damaged
relationship with the nation's Aborigines by making a commitment
toward reconciliation between blacks and whites.
	   Outlining his second term agenda, Howard promised a stronger
focus on social policies and said he wants a formal reconciliation
document between the government and Aborigines by the centenary of
Australia's federation in 2001.
	   But Howard again refused to consider apologizing on behalf of
the nation to the as many as 100,000 Aborigines known as the
``Stolen Generation,'' who were taken from their families on the
basis of their race and placed in welfare, under former state and
federal policies which existed for decades until the late 1960s.
	   Denying he feared an official apology would lead to claims for
monetary compensation, Howard said his refusal was ``commonsense''
because current-generation Australians were not responsible for
past policies.
	   ``I have a genuine belief that you express collective regret for
things for which you are collectively, in a direct sense,
responsible,'' Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   ``I don't think it applies to the current generation of
Australians.''
	   Aboriginal leaders criticized Howard for spelling out his
desired outcomes for reconciliation without consulting Aborigines.
	   Pat Dodson, the former chairman of the government-appointed
Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Friday said an apology to
the stolen generations was a fundamental requirement to
reconciliation.
	   ``It's non-negotiable. If (Howard) as prime minister can't do it
then the country is going to have to get another prime minister,''
Dodson said in a radio interview.
	   The relationship between Aborigines and the government reached
its nadir earlier this year when the government passed laws to
restrict Aborigines' limited rights to claim native title to
government-leased land.
	   The government-funded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Commission then passed a no-confidence vote in Aboriginal Affairs
Minister John Herron and called for his resignation.
	   Commission chairman Gatjil Djerrkura said Wednesday
reconciliation was possible by 2001 but it will require better
communication between ATSIC and the government than existed in
Howard's first term.

Thai currency strongest in 11 months, stock market up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's currency rose to its highest
level against the U.S. dollar in 11 months, while the stock market
was up 6.8 percent Friday.
	   The strengthening of the Thai baht was in line with most
regional currencies after a sudden cut in U.S. interest rates,
dealers said.
	   At mid-morning Friday the baht stood at 37.85, down from 37.90
to the U.S. dollar at the close of trading Thursday. The baht was
at its highest level against the dollar since Nov. 10 last year.
	   Thai share prices were up 6.8 percent at the open Friday in line
with the overnight jump on Wall Street and morning rallies on East
Asian markets as investors welcomed the U.S. Federal Reserve's cut
of lending rates.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand was up 20.06 points to 315.25,
from Thursday's close of 295.19. Advancing shares were out pacing
declines 147 to 3.
	   The Asian economic crisis began in Thailand in mid-1997 with a
devaluation of the baht which had long stood at around 25 baht to
the U.S. dollar.

After lashing Philippines, Typhoon Zeb kills six in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Six people were dead and four missing in
Taiwan as Typhoon Zeb roared across the island Friday after killing
at least 24 and forcing 103,000 to flee their homes in the
Philippines.
	   At 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) Zeb was moving north-northeast over
Taiwan at 22 kilometers (13 miles) per hour with sustained winds at
its center of 138 kilometers (86 miles) per hour, said Wu Teh-tung,
deputy director of the Central Weather Bureau's forecasting
division.
	   Winds and rain would gradually drop in intensity by early
evening, Wu said.
	   Rivers in the Taipei area swelled their banks, and low lying
urban areas in Taipei county were flooded by torrential rains.
Residents were evacuated to safety by rescue workers patrolling
through the night in inflatable boats.
	   Nervous residents of the Lincoln Mansions housing project where
28 died in a building collapse during Typhoon Winnie last year were
evacuated to hotels by the county government. Others living in
mountainous areas of the county were moved to escape the danger of
rock slides.
	   One woman was reportedly drowned in Taipei, and two persons were
killed in eastern Hualien county when their car plunged into a
flooded drainage ditch, the Interior Ministry's disaster rescue
center reported.
	   A man was killed in central Changhua county when a falling tree
threw him from his motor scooter, and in southern Tainan, a man
riding a motor bike was killed by a shop sign loosened by raging
winds. A man fishing off a breakwater in southeastern Taitung
county was drowned and four more people were reported missing
throughout Taiwan.
	   One person was reported badly injured and nine treated for light
injuries, the center said.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour and gusts
measuring (295 kilometers) 184 miles per hour.
	   Some 10,160 still were housed in 28 government shelters in the
Philippines after being forced to flee their homes as Zeb brought
rampaging floods and peak sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150
miles) per hour.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number of others were missing after boulders, mud and
debris crashed down a mountain and covered a workers' quarters of
the Luzon Hydroelectric Cooperative, the provincial disaster office
said.
	   In nearby Baguio City, also in Benguet, five people died in
separate landslides, and Kim Young-nin, a 30-year-old student from
Ulsan, South Korea, died after a section of road collapsed, sending
his car plunging into a ravine, said police spokesman Chief
Inspector Ricardo Villena.

Elmar Setzer, Chiapas governor when insurgency began, dead at 62
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Elmar Setzer, governor
of the southern Mexican state of Chiapas when the Zapatista
insurgency broke out, has died at age 62.
	   Setzer died Thursday morning at his home in Santiago in the
northern state of Nuevo Leon. Dr. Juan Manuel Guerra Sepulveda of
the Muguerza Medical Center said he died of complications of kidney
disease, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Setzer was appointed governor of Chiapas in 1993, replacing
Patrocinio Gonzalez, who had been named interior minister.
	   On Jan. 1, 1994, masked rebels of the Zapatista National
Liberation Army staged an uprising in Chiapas in the name of
greater democracy and Indian rights. Setzer at first dismissed the
rebels as ```100 indigenous transgressors of the law,'' but
resigned 17 days later, saying he wanted to contribute to peace in
the state.

Asian markets tip their hats to U.S. moves and record big gains
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Led by the Hong Kong index, which leaped 7.5
percent, Asia's top three stock markets all opened with big gains
Friday, thanks to an unexpected reduction in U.S. interest rates,
followed by a surge on Wall Street.
	   But the dollar took another slide against the yen, which hurts
Asian exporters, and some analysts said it won't take long for
local concerns to override the benefits of America's moves.
	   ``External problems may be eased by the U.S. rate cut, but the
problems remain with Japan's domestic economy,'' said Kenji
Karikomi, a general manager at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
	   Across the board Thursday, the United States provided Asia's
rattled and depressed markets with one good sign after another.
	   For the second time in about two weeks, the U.S. Federal Reserve
cut interest rates by a quarter-point. The surprise reductions
ignited an explosive rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial
average ended the day up 330.58 points, or 4.2 percent, its
third-biggest point gain in history.
	   American economists also speculated that more rate cuts are
imminent as the central bank tries to keep global economic turmoil
from dragging the United States into a recession.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index surged at the opening, leaping
672.72 points, or 7.5 percent.
	   Investors hoped that the territory's banks would once again
follow the U.S. lead and reduce interest rates, too. And that
optimism was clearest in property stocks, a sector that led all
others with a 12 percent increase.
	   The Hang Seng Index was hovering at levels not seen since late
May, and volume also was very heavy.
	   In Tokyo, following three days of declines, the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 284.92 points, or 2.19
percent, to 13,280.29 as of midday Friday.
	   As gains led declines 795 to 283, market analysts in Tokyo
credited eased worries about the direction of the U.S. economy.
	   However, the dollar bought 116.45 yen in late morning trading,
down 2.28 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and also below its New
York level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen for two weeks, and
that hurts exporters by making their products more expensive
overseas, and reduces the value of their repatriated earnings.
	   The success of key exporters such as Sony, Honda and Fujitsu has
provided Japan one of the few brights spots in its economy, which
is suffering its worst recession since World War II.
	   Despite the stock surge, traders said the outlook of Tokyo's
bourse remains weak. They said expected declines in corporate
earnings and skepticism about new efforts by the government to bail
out troubled banks have left investors pessimistic.
	   ``If anything, we expect the market to move downward in the
short term,'' said Jason James, a strategist at HSBC James Capel
Securities, in Tokyo.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index surged 4.7 percent, or
47.86 points, to 1,072.61 on Friday morning.
	   In fact, moments after the market opened, it had moved even
higher, jumping as much as 5.8 percent to reach an all-time high in
points since the index was revamped seven weeks ago.

Report: Malaysia moves to curb sales of opposition newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities moved to curb sales of
an opposition party newspaper as its editors stepped up a campaign
to garner greater sympathy for jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, news
reports said Friday.
	   The publishers of Harakah, the official newspaper of the Parti
Islam SeMalaysia, or PAS, have been ordered to explain to the Home
Ministry why they were selling the paper on newsstands in an
apparent violation of a rule against public distribution, New
Straits Times daily reported.
	   Samsudin Osman, secretary-general of the home ministry, said
Thursday that the Harakah was allowed to be sold only to members of
the Islamic party and not to the public.
	   ``We have reminded the publisher several times in the past,'' he
said. ``We are going to remind them again of this requirement at
the meeting next week.''
	   Editors of the newspaper said that sales have skyrocketed over
the past two months, since they started publishing strident
articles against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 as deputy prime minister
and finance minister after being dubbed too immoral to rule.
	   Beginning Nov. 2, he faces trial for alleged corruption and
illegal homosexual acts. Anwar has denied the 10 charges, saying
they were fabricated to eliminate the challenge he posed to
Mahathir.
	   The Harakah and other fringe papers published by opposition
activists on the Internet, have become increasingly popular among
Malaysians jaded by pro-government coverage in the nation's major
newspapers.
	   The Islamic group, meanwhile, continued to organize
demonstrations in defiance of authorities.
	   Late Thursday, more than 2,000 people defied police to gather in
the northern Kedah state to listen to speeches by the president of
PAS, Fadzil Noor, and other leaders of a new coalition of
opposition groups, the Malaysian People's Justice Movement.
	   The rally was held at a religious school in rural Kedah state,
just a few miles (kilometers) away from Mahathir's home town.
Hundreds of people were prevented by police from reaching the rally
in the Mahathir's home state, eyewitnesses said.
	   Police also broke up a gathering Thursday in the house of an
opposition activist in the southern city of Johor Baru.
	   Only two speeches were made before police moved in and ordered
the crowd to disperse. Police said the organizers didn't obtain a
permit for the gathering.
	   Opposition activists announced plans for more protests Saturday,
calling for thousands of families to gather in downtown Kuala
Lumpur. More than 5,000 people had gathered at a similar protest at
the same place last Saturday, shouting slogans demanding Mahathir's
resignation.
	   Police have so far arrested more than 150 people who have taken
to the streets to protest Anwar's arrest. Most of them have been
released on bail.

Huge heroin bust: charged men remanded in custody
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Eighteen men charged with importing the
largest shipment of heroin ever intercepted in Australia were
remanded to custody when they appeared in court Friday.
	   The men, aged between 21-51, were charged with offenses
including importing a commercial quantity of a prohibited narcotic,
possession of a prohibited narcotic and aiding the importation of a
prohibited narcotic.
	   The seven Hong Kong Chinese nationals and 11 Indonesians,
appearing before Magistrate Allan Moore in Sydney's Central Local
Court, did not apply for bail and were remanded in custody to
appear at the same court on Dec. 11.
	   They were arrested on Wednesday after Australian police and
customs officers intercepted a ship-to-shore transfer 900 pounds
(400 kilograms) of heroin on an isolated beach in New South Wales
state.
	   Hong Kong police aided in the operation which resulted in the
seizure.
	   Australian authorities said the heroin was worth about
Australian dollars 400 million (U.S. dlrs 250 million).

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Pushing to finish talks on forming a new
center-left government, Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
revisit the divisive issue of energy taxes Friday.
	   Party leaders, who had hoped to wrap up the negotiations this

Monday.
	   Social policies, which were on the agenda for Friday, were
pushed back a day so that more time could be devoted to energy
questions, including ending the use of atomic power and raising
taxes on gasoline and other forms of energy.
	   On Thursday the two sides said that they had agreed to pass a
law within the first 100 days in office to abandon nuclear energy,
a move strongly pushed by the environmentalist Greens, who wanted
immediate closure of some plants.
	   But in what party leaders called a compromise, the future
governing partners agreed to start talks with the nuclear industry
next year on the fate of Germany's 19 atomic power plants.
	   If no consensus with industry can be reached by November 1999,
Greens party leader Juergen Trittin said legislation will be
enacted setting a timetable for plant closures. That timetable was
left undefined.
	   While Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has spoken of pulling
the plug on nuclear power plants over the next 30 years, Trittin
insisted ``a series of atomic power plants will go off line in this
legislative period,'' meaning the next four years.
	   One-third of Germany's electricity is produced by nuclear
energy. Power companies argue shutting them prematurely would
result in higher prices and force them to rely more on burning oil
and coal, creating more pollution.
	   ``We have always said that we wouldn't turn our back on
consensual talks,'' said Hermann Venghaus, spokesman for industry
giant RWE. ``But we have always held the standpoint that nuclear
energy ... should continue to play an important role in the energy
mix.''
	   Meanwhile, incumbent Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
Christian Democrats, who lost to the Social Democrats in Sept. 27
elections, criticized the incoming government's plan to liberalize
Germany's citizenship law, saying it could be unconstitutional.
	   CDU legal expert Rupert Scholz said allowing dual-citizenship on
a broad basis would give those who receive it ``massive
advantages'' over Germans with just one passport.
	   The changes would scrap the principle of a 1913 law that bases
automatic citizenship on German blood ties, not place of birth.
	   The changes are seen by the incoming government as an important
gesture to 7 million foreign residents in Germany, nearly 10
percent of the population.
	   Easing citizenship rules was of special concern to Germany's 2
million Turks, many of whom were invited to take jobs in Germany
during a labor shortage in the boom years of the 1960s and whose
children were born and raised virtually as Germans.
	   ``This is a signal that we foreigners have been waiting decades
for,'' said Murat Cakir, the Turkish chairman of the national
sub-committee on foreigners in Wiesbaden.
	   It will allow those who take advantage of it better access to
employment in Germany, freer travel around the European Union, and
the right to vote in Germany.
	   But some conservatives complained dual-citizenship could lead to
divided loyalties, especially as they entered the German army to
fulfill compulsory military service.
	   Christoph Hillenbrandt, spokesman for the state Interior
Ministry in the conservative-stronghold of Bavaria, questioned how
Germany would react if it had to send German-Turkish soldiers
against Kurds in Iraq, or German-Serb soldiers as peacekeepers to
Kosovo.

Indonesian minister wants to outlaw sorcery as killings continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Some Indonesians use one name &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shocked by the mysterious murders of
at least 153 people accused of sorcery, Indonesia's justice
minister wants black magic outlawed even though it's been practiced
in the Southeast Asian nation since ancient times.
	   During recent months, parts of the main island of Java have been
terrorized by masked killers dressed in black, according to police,
witnesses and media reports.
	   They say the killers strike at night, cutting their victims
throats and sometimes hanging mutilated bodies in trees or tossing
them in the street.
	   In scenes reminiscent of the Salem witch hunts in the United
States centuries ago, mobs have also attacked and killed people
they accuse of dabbling in black magic.
	   Some of the dead were Muslim clerics. Others were farmers or
ordinary villagers.
	   Police have arrested more than 100 suspects, but admit there's
no clear motive for the grisly slayings.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper Friday quoted Justice Minister Muladi
as saying fear of sorcery has stirred up unrest and violence in
superstitious communities.
	   ``The impact of this issue is very disturbing and it often
claims innocent victims,'' he said.
	   He said anyone who openly claims they can kill or hurt others
with black magic should be punished.
	   ``That would be one way to resolve the witchcraft issue,''
Muladi said.
	   In one attack this week an angry mob in the second most populous
city, Surabaya, stormed a police station where they thought a local
shaman had taken refuge.
	   ``People become suspicious of just about anything nowadays,''
said North Surabaya police chief Lt. Col. Sunaryono.
	   The surge in violence has erupted as Indonesia grapples with
political turmoil and the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Violent protests killed about 1,200 people and helped drive
former authoritarian President Suharto from office in May. At that
time members of the mostly Christian or Buddhist ethnic Chinese
minority were targeted because of their relative wealth.
	   However, this new violence is now plaguing the Islamic majority.
Amid the social confusion of the economic crisis _ skyrocketing
inflation, unemployment, poverty and food shortages _ no one is
sure who is doing the killing or why.
	   Police speculate the slayings might be in revenge for the
slaughter of tens of thousands of communists in the mid-1960s when
Suharto took power after an abortive coup attempt.
	   Historians say Muslim clerics helped the army carry out the
carnage. With Suharto out of office, many fear old scores are being
settled.
	   Others believe the killings may represent a bloody power play
before general elections to be held next year under proposed
democratic reforms.
	   A third possibility is that some Muslim groups want to stamp out
mysticism that still permeates Indonesian society hundreds of years
after the arrival of Islam.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Nevertheless, many otherwise devout Indonesian Muslims often
worship spirits. Shamans are in high demand by those who want good
luck, a better love life, improved health or revenge against an
enemy or rival.

Joint United States-Laotian operation to account for MIAs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ American and Laotian experts are
excavating eight sites and investigating 24 cases related to U.S.
servicemen missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam War, the
U.S. Embassy in Laos said Friday.
	   The operation, which began Oct. 1, marks the 40th time that
American and Laotian teams have scoured for clues to the fate of
the MIAs, according to a press statement.
	   The current search will last until the end of the month. It
covers three southern Laotian provinces _ Savannakhet, Saravan and
Xekong.
	   The U.S. team consists of 40 American specialists with
experience in remains recovery operations. It is led by Lt. Col.
Robert Gahagan, commander of the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting
in the Laotian capital of Vientiane. JTF-FA was formed in January
1992 and is headquartered in Hawaii.
	   There are 2,081 Americans still unaccounted for from the wars in
Southeast Asia, of which 444 are in Laos. Most of the 444 were
airmen bombing the Ho Chi Minh Trail to stop North Vietnam from
moving troops and supplies through Laos into South Vietnam.
	   Although not officially at war in Laos, the United States backed
the government then in Vientiane in its fight with
Vietnamese-backed Pathet Lao Communists. In an unsuccessful effort
to stem communist advances, Washington unleashed history's most
intense aerial bombardment on Laos.
	   Seeking the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing in
action is a matter of highest national priority for the U.S.
government, the statement said.

Typhoon Zeb heads for Japan after hitting the Philippines hard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death toll rising to 63 in the Philippines, six
killed in Taiwan, latest typhoon location, velocity weakened &QL; 
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A weakened typhoon Zeb approached islands in
southern Japan on Friday, after killing at least 63 people in the
Philippines, six in Taiwan, and leaving a trail of destruction.
	   Packing maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph), Zeb was
located about 190 kilometers (118 miles) west of the island of
Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture, or state, as of 1:00 p.m. (0400
GMT), Japan's Meteorological Agency said.
	   It was moving north-northeast at about 20 kph (12 mph) in the
East China Sea, the agency said. Weather reports forecast rain for
most of western and central Japan over the weekend due to the
effects of the typhoon.
	   Two domestic flights from Tokyo's Haneda airport to Okinawan
islands in the south were canceled Friday morning because of the
typhoon, airport authorities said.
	   Disaster officials in the Philippines said the typhoon left at
least 63 people dead, mostly due to drownings and landslides. At
least one person died of electrocution, while another was bitten by
a snake.
	   The casualty figure is expected to rise because several mountain
villages in the northern Philippines remain isolated. President
Joseph Estrada flew Friday to the Cagayan Valley region, one of the
hardest-hit areas, to personally inspect the typhoon's damage.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   Among the dead were two young brothers _ ages 2 and 4 _ killed
when a hill unleashed tons of mud and debris on the town of
Antipolo, just outside Manila. Their 6-year-old sister survived.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number were missing after boulders, mud and debris
crashed down a mountain and buried workers' quarters of the Luzon
Hydroelectric Cooperative.
	   In nearby Baguio City, five people died in separate landslides,
and a 30-year-old South Korean student was killed when a section of
road collapsed, plunging his car into a ravine, said Chief
Inspector Ricardo Villena.
	   ``There are so many reports of landslides that will keep us busy
for a while,'' Villena said.
	   At least five provinces have been declared in a state of
calamity, to allow emergency funds to be released to these areas.
Price control also has been established to prevent profiteers from
taking advantage of the situation.
	   In Taiwan, six people were dead and four missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Rivers in the Taipei area swelled their banks, and low lying
urban areas in Taipei county were flooded by torrential rains.
Residents were evacuated to safety by rescue workers patrolling
through the night in inflatable boats.
	   One woman was reportedly drowned in Taipei, and two persons were
killed in eastern Hualien county when their car plunged into a
flooded drainage ditch, the Interior Ministry's disaster rescue
center reported.
	   A man was killed in central Changhua county when a falling tree
threw him from his motor scooter, and in southern Tainan, a man
riding a motor bike was killed by a shop sign loosened by raging
winds. A man fishing off a breakwater in southeastern Taitung
county was drowned and four more people were reported missing
throughout Taiwan.
	   One person was reported badly injured and nine treated for light
injuries, the center said.
	   Schools and offices were closed in most parts of the island
Friday, and the stock exchange also suspended trading in the
capital of Taipei.
	   Among the four other people killed, one was smashed by a fallen
billboard and one by a fallen tree. One person was swept out to sea
by two-story high waves while fishing, while another died after
being trapped overnight in heavy rain.
	   Many international flights were canceled, and others arriving in
Taipei were rerouted to Hong Kong, airport officials said.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour and gusts
measuring (295 kilometers) 184 miles per hour.
	   Definitions of typhoons vary from country to country. In Japan,
any storm with sustained maximum wind speeds of 65 kilometers (41
miles) per hour is classified as a typhoon. In the United States,
sustained winds must reach 118 kilometers (74 miles) per hour to be
considered a typhoon.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers drowned and
80 missing and presumed dead.

Lions 27, Packers 20
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PONTIAC, Michigan (AP) _ The Detroit defense torched Brett Favre
for three interceptions while Charlie Batch played like anything
but a rookie in the Lions' 27-20 victory over the Green Bay Packers
in an NFC game Thursday night.
	   It was the second straight loss for the Packers (4-2) and
dropped them further behind the Minnesota Vikings (5-0) in the
division race. The Lions (2-4) fought back from a 10-0 deficit and
outscored Green Bay 17-7 in the fourth quarter.
	   Batch, who was 16-of-19 for 218 yards without an interception,
hooked up with fellow rookie Germane Crowell for a 68-yard
touchdown pass play to take a 17-13 lead on the first play of the
fourth quarter and Barry Sanders, who had 155 yards on 25 carries,
sprinted 73 yards for another touchdown with 8:05 left.
	   It was the third straight game in which Favre has thrown three
interceptions. His third against Detroit set up Jason Hanson's
36-yard field goal to ice the victory with 2:08 remaining.
	   Favre, who was 22-of-43 for 300 yards, had a 67-yard touchdown
pass to Antonio Freeman in the first quarter and a 14-yarder to
Freeman with three seconds left in the game.
	   Favre has thrown 17 interceptions against 14 touchdown passes in
the Pontiac Silverdome. Last season, he also had an ugly day at the
Silverdome, throwing three interceptions, including one from his
knees that linebacker Reggie Brown returned for a score in a
Detroit victory.
	   Mark Carrier, burned when he failed to switch to Freeman on the
67-yard touchdown pass play on Green Bay's fourth snap of the game,
made up for it the next time he was tested.
	   Carrier, playing like a center fielder, leaped in front of
Freeman to snag Favre's pass in front of the Green Bay bench early
in the second quarter and returned it 33 yards to the Packers 12.
	   Four plays later, on fourth-and-1 at the 3, Batch got the
Packers to bite on a good fake to fullback Tommy Vardell running
into the line, then flipped a touchdown pass to Pete Chryplewicz
all alone in the left corner of the end zone to tie it 10-all.
	   Ryan Longwell gave the Packers a 10-0 lead with a 28-yard field
goal with 3:08 left in the first quarter.
	   Roell Preston's 47-yard return with the second-half kickoff
helped set up Longwell's 40-yarder for the only score of the third
quarter and a 13-10 Green Bay lead.
	   The Lions drove from their 9 to the Green Bay 2, only to have
Vardell's fumble kill that drive.
	   On their next possession, however, the Lions went 69 yards in
just three plays for the go-ahead touchdown on the pass to Crowell.
	   Sanders had an 80-yard touchdown called back by a holding
penalty about two minutes after his 73-yard score.

Share prices surge on U.S. rate cut, short-covering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices surged early Friday, spurred by an
unexpected U.S. rate cut which added momentum to a recent rally
underpinned by a wave of short-covering.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 669.95 points, or 7.5
percent, to 9,640.37 at the midday close, adding to Thursday's 1.5
percent rally.
	   Turnover more than doubled to 8.09 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.04 billion), from 3.44 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 441 million ) in the same session Thursday.
	   While traders expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates
soon, they were surprised by its decision Thursday to cut two
interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, without waiting for
the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee next month.
	   The Fed's action turns up the heat on the Hong Kong Association
of Banks to cut the deposit rate after its weekly meeting later
Friday.
	   Rising hopes of a local rate cut pushed up the banking and
property sectors, which have both been hard hit by a collapse in
property prices, investor confidence, and an economic slowdown in
the territory.
	   The Hang Seng property sub-index had gained 12 percent by
midday.
	   ``Property stocks are really interest rate-sensitive, so if
interest rates continue to slide it will really help the
developers,'' said Ben Kwong, head of research at Dharmala
Securities Co. Ltd.
	   The market has been benefiting from a wave of short-covering in
recent weeks. Short-covering is the buying back of borrowed stocks.
	   Kent Rossiter, Nikko Securities Co. (Asia) Ltd.'s institutional
sales head, said a small portion of the volume came from funds,
which were rushing to join the recent rally.
	   ``They can't afford to be locked out (of a rising market),'' he
said.

Asian markets jump following U.S. rate cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets soared early Friday as the
surprise cut in U.S. interest rates allayed fears of a global
recession, luring foreign investors back into the region's battered
bourses.
	   But analysts discounted the rallies as a knee-jerk reaction,
saying the extent of the world's financial problems has yet to
unfold.
	   ``Asia is mired in a crisis with massive debts overhanging and
enormous deflation pressure,'' said Andrew Fernow, research
director for Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   ``To suggest that the problem can be dealt with overnight or
with a few rate cuts in the U.S. is just absurd,'' he said.
	   Despite warnings of looming problems, foreign fund managers
continued to pour money back into Asia.
	   Hong Kong led the region's rally, with the blue-chip Hang Seng
Index having soared 7.5 percent to 9,640.37 by midday, on top of
Thursday's 1.5 percent gain.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Thursday to reduce interest
rates by a quarter point turned up the heat on the Hong Kong
Association of Banks to cut the deposit rate after its weekly
meeting later Friday.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index had leapt 7.5 percent, or
77.14 points, to 1,101.89 at midday.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
284.92 points, or 2.19 percent, to 13,280.29 as of midday. On
Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 75.36 points, or 0.58 percent for
a third straight day of declines.
	   Among other Asian markets, Thailand's SET index surged 6.8
percent to 315.25; Indonesia's key JSX index rose 4.8 percent to
319.304 points; and South Korea's Kospi surged 3.3 percent to
380.80.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen. At
midday, the dollar bought 116.45 yen, down 2.28 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 116.75
yen overnight.
	   The Fed surprised markets with its first emergency interest-rate
cuts in more than four years, acknowledging tacitly that its
quarter-point rate cut last month wasn't sufficient to defuse a
looming U.S. credit crunch.
	   The move triggered a rally on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average closed up 330.58 points, or 4.1 percent, at
8,299.
	   Fernow, the research director at Vickers, said the rate cut has
raised an alarm, ignored Friday by investors.
	   ``This suggests a rather desperate attempt to address what could
be very devastating problem,'' he said.
	   ``We don't know the full extent of the breakdown of the
financial system due to the exposure of some financial institutions
have, not only to the emerging markets, but also hedge fund trading
that have kept very secret,'' he said.

Wistful cosmonaut Titov envies Glenn's return to orbit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When John Glenn rockets into space
again, the only living man to precede him into orbit will be
watching longingly.
	   ``He is lucky, very lucky,'' former Soviet cosmonaut German
Titov said. ``It is an old spaceman's dream.''
	   Titov, 62, circled the earth 17 times during Aug. 6-7, 1961, six
months ahead of Glenn's three-orbit flight. Now age 77, Glenn is
training to return to space aboard a shuttle Oct. 29.
	   On a recent visit to a Stockholm exhibit of memorabilia from the
early years of the space race, Titov recalled the excitement and
intense U.S.-U.S.S.R. rivalry of those days.
	   ``In my opinion, we should always have been cooperating, from
the very beginning,'' he said, gazing at a model Mir space station
suspended from the exhibit hall's ceiling. ``I am very glad that is
happening now.''
	   After two decades of viewing the other's achievements as
potential military threats, the two countries in 1975 arranged the
link-up of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft in orbit. An American
astronaut lived aboard Mir for 4 1/2 months in 1997.
	   When the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik in 1957,
Titov was one of the millions worldwide who scanned the skies in
hopes of seeing it. He recently had completed training as a fighter
pilot.
	   ``I never saw it,'' he said, and what's more, ``I was very
skeptical'' that plans to send a man into space would ever be
realized.
	   Nevertheless, he enrolled in the first cosmonauts group in 1960,
and had a front-row seat when Lt. Yuri Gagarin blasted off April
12, 1961, into space, history and public acclaim.
	   For a long time, Titov brooded that he should have been chosen.
But now he admits that Gagarin's good looks and vibrant personality
were important ``right stuff'' ingredients.
	   ``Everything about Gagarin was suitable to be first,'' Titov
said through a translator. ``After a while, we can see it was
right. He was not only a Soviet cosmonaut. He was the world's first
astronaut. He was right for that.''
	   Gagarin died in a plane crash in 1968. The first American in
space, Alan Shepard, who went up 23 days after Gagarin, died this
year.
	   Like Glenn, now a senator representing Ohio, Titov eventually
went into politics, becoming a member of the Russian parliament. He
wishes the parallels would continue with a chance to go back into
space himself.
	   But though he looks fit and at age 62, is 15 years younger than
Glenn, that won't happen, Titov said, because of Russia's political
and economic turmoil.
	   That doesn't stop him from dreaming about another chance to see
Earth through a spaceship's window, a glowing blue orb amid the
blackness.
	   ``It's unforgettable,'' Titov said. ``It's like your first love
_ impossible to forget. In a way, that is my only love.''
	   His wife, Tamara, was standing nearby, but gave no sign she had
heard.

 &UR; Track record tumbles as Zanardi leads qualifiers &QL; 
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) _ Italian Alex Zanardi led a
record assault on the newly resurfaced Surfers Paradise street
circuit Friday to qualify fastest after the first session for
Sunday's Australian IndyCarnival.
	   The Formula One-bound Zanardi, now favorite for his seventh
Indy-car win of the season, broke the previous record by more than
2.5 seconds over the 4.5-kilometer (2.795-mile) temporary circuit.
	   Twenty of the 28 drivers finished the session under the existing
record of 1 minute, 34.87 seconds set by Nigel Mansell of Britain
in 1994, including Zanardi's 1:32.310. All will have a chance to
improve on their times in Saturday's second qualifying session.
	   ``I want pole position badly because I haven't had one this
year,'' Zanardi said.
	   Scotland's Dario Franchitti was second-fastest Friday in
1:32.781 and Brazil's Gil de Ferran third in 1:32.851. Bryan Herta
was fourth, 1994 winner Michael Andretti fifth and defending
champion Scott Pruett sixth.
	   Race officials said recent resurfacing of the track and improved
engine and chassis design since the race was last held here 18
months ago resulted in the much improved times.
	   ``The new surface is rough but there is more grip which is why
we are going faster than last year,'' said Andretti. ``The track is
one that you can attack and it pays you back with good lap times.''
	   Zanardi was the pole winner here last year but finished fourth.
	   The 1996 rookie of the year and 1997 series winner, Zanardi has
already clinched the 1998 series title after winning six races and
14 in 49 starts for Target-Chip Ganassi Racing. He has amassed 250
points in 17 races this season, 102 more than second-place Jimmy
Vasser.
	   Sunday's race will be 65 laps, a total distance of 292.38
kilometers (181.675 miles). (djp)

Indonesia's president wants kids off street, back in school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president has promised to
take a growing number of homeless children off the street and put
them back into school, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
	   Many children have been forced to drop out of school because of
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Exact numbers of dropouts and homeless children are not known.
However, many can be seen in the capital Jakarta begging or
performing music in the streets for money.
	   Others are put to work by cash-strapped parents who struggle to
make ends meet as prices soar and poverty mounts.
	   Research and Technology Minister Zuhal said President B.J.
Habibie has ordered various government ministries to make lists of
street children.
	   ``If parents are unable to send their children to school, the
state must take care of them,'' Zuhul quoted Habibie as saying, the
Post reported.
	   Zuhul said homeless and uneducated children are part of the
nation's future.
	   ``Who knows? One of them could become president,'' he said.
	   Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono said an average of about 3
million children from elementary school through high school have
dropped out each year over the past decade.
	   He said this had increased by an extra 3.5 million this year
because of the economic crisis.
	   The Post said official figures showed that only 54 percent of
the country's 40 million children, aged between 7 and 15 years,
were now in the country's 9-year compulsory educational system.
	   Two years ago before the crisis hit, the number was 72 percent.

Deal done, Taiwan negotiator heads for Beijing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated after Koo's O700 GMT arrival in Beijing &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ After a pleasant morning's sightseeing,
Taiwan's top China negotiator headed to Beijing Friday for the
second leg of a visit that already has helped thaw relations
between the two rivals.
	   Koo Chen-fu's trip to Beijing for meetings with President Jiang
Zemin and other officials followed two days of exploratory talks in
Shanghai that produced an agreement for China and Taiwan to work
toward repairing their shattered dialogue.
	   The deal, sealed over cups of tea Thursday by Koo and his
Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, was the most significant advance
in China-Taiwan relations since Beijing canceled talks three years
ago.
	   On Friday morning, Koo and his wife visited a 400-year-old park
in Shanghai before boarding an afternoon flight to Beijing. Koo was
to spend two days in the Chinese capital, with sightseeing and
banquets scheduled before his Sunday meetings with President Jiang
and Vice Premier Qian Qichen.
	   In Taiwan, initial reaction was muted to Thursday's agreement _
which was essentially to talk about more formal talks. Newspapers
and observers said major differences remained despite the improved
atmosphere evidenced by the Koo-Wang meetings, their first in five
years.
	   Newspapers also noted that the two sides did not discuss the
possibility of a meeting between President Jiang and Taiwanese
President Lee Teng-hui, a subject of intense interest in Taiwan
before Koo's China visit.
	   Political heirs to a seven-decade-old Chinese civil war, China
and Taiwan have rarely compromised since Mao Tse-tung's Communists
vanquished Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists from the mainland in
1949.
	   After Taiwan's Lee made the first-ever visit by a Taiwanese
president to the United States in 1995, Beijing scrubbed a 2-year
dialogue and launched intimidating war games near the island.
Relations plunged to their lowest level since the height of the
Cold War.
	   Under the four-point deal reached Thursday at a swank Shanghai
hotel, members of the two government-backed bodies that Wang and
Koo head will hold discussions on all matters.
	   Wang's chief aide, Tang Shubei, said the talks would cover
political matters, a euphemism for reunification _ a subject
Beijing has long sought to put on the agenda.
	   Koo also invited Wang to visit Taiwan, and Wang agreed.
	   ``Our dialogue this time embodied real spirit,'' Wang, an
84-year-old ex-mayor of Shanghai and mentor to President Jiang
Zemin, said in offering a toast at a banquet after the day's
meeting.
	   ``We will wholeheartedly and sincerely wait to see you in
Taipei,'' said Koo, an 81-year-old business tycoon and Nationalist
Party elder.
	   Local and international politics played a hand in coaxing China
and Taiwan to move ahead.
	   The Nationalists hope improved ties with China will win them
business community support in upcoming elections.
	   Chinese President Jiang faces pressure from the powerful Chinese
military and communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to
reunification.

Russian Arctic city offers two guarantees: tough life, regular pay

	   NORILSK, Russia (AP) _ Freezing winds send snow squalls and
factory smoke drifting across the endless tundra of this bleak
mining outpost. But the largest nickel mine in the world does offer
something rare in Russia these days: a reliable paycheck.
	   Norilsk Nickel, a sprawling collection of nickel mines and
hulking smelters, is the sole reason 230,000 Russians have come
here, making the city the world's largest north of the Arctic
Circle. It is also why they are willing to put up with endless
winters, limited contact with the outside world and the absence of
many human comforts.
	   ``Just look around you. All of Russian industry has ground to a
halt and we are still here, and we are paying our wages on time,''
boasted Alexander Bururhin, head engineer at Norilsk Nickel. ``As
difficult as life is here, our workers know that they have it much
better than their relatives on the mainland.''
	   In geographical terms, Norilsk is actually part of the Russian
land mass. But in psychological terms it's as isolated as any
island.
	   The city, established in 1933 by dictator Josef Stalin as a
prison camp, is more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) north of the
Arctic Circle. A plane flight from Moscow is a five-hour journey to
the northeast, and there are no roads to or from Norilsk.
	   ``My children have never seen a live cow or a field of
potatoes,'' said factory worker Sasha Bodanin, a 20-year veteran of
Norilsk. ``They have no idea what it feels like to strip off your
clothes and go for a swim on a summer day, to feel the hot sun on
your back.''
	   The ground is covered with snow for all but the brief summer
months. Even then, there is no farming because the soil is packed
with nickel and other heavy metals.
	   The mines and smelters, which operate 24 hours a day, ring the
high-rise apartments that form the center of the city. There are
food and clothing stores, a few restaurants and bars, and a movie
theater, but the diversions are few.
	   The Norilsk operation has 86,000 workers. When the workday
finishes, miners are covered in grime, their throats and eyes often
burning. They board rickety buses in the freezing darkness and head
home to run-down Soviet-era apartments, only to rise in the morning
darkness the next day to do it all over again.
	   ``I understand now that I will never leave here, although I
dream of it,'' Galina Yeremeeva, 25, said as she prepared to board
an elevator that would take her down nearly a mile (kilometer) into
a mine.
	   Attracted by the high wages, Yeremeeva's parents came here in
1980, when she was just 7 years old. Like most, they hoped to make
good money, save some of it and eventually leave.
	   But the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic
turmoil meant that they haven't been saving anything. In fact,
they're just barely getting by.
	   ``Prices are so high here. Everything must be shipped in from
the mainland,'' said Yeremeeva, wearing her miner's helmet. ``I
spend most of my earnings just feeding my family.''
	   Health problems are rampant. The environmental group Greenpeace
says toxic smoke from the factor's furnaces and acid rain, have
effectively killed the forest for up to 60 miles (96 kilometers) to
the southeast of town.
	   Yet the plant continues to churn out about 200,000 tons (181,437
metric tons) of nickel a year, roughly 20 percent of the world
supply.
	   The company, controlled by business tycoon Vladimir Potanin,
reported losses of dlrs 257 million in the first half of this year
and has been hard hit by falling nickel prices, which recently fell
to an 11-year low.
	   The operation is also burdened by the huge cost of supporting
the town _ about dlrs 200 million a year for the schools, hospitals
and housing.
	   ``This is the Soviet legacy we inherited. It is not profitable
for us, but it's clear that if we didn't support the town, then
Norilsk would cease to exist,'' said Bururhin, the head engineer.
	   For the workers, moving to a new city, finding another job and a
place to live seem like monumental obstacles. It's a daunting
prospect to venture elsewhere in Russia, where millions of workers
get paid months late, if at all.
	   ``We are caught in a cycle of subsistence,'' said miner Irina
Baldovsko. ``We would all leave if we had any other options, but we
are trapped by circumstances.''

Police appeal for help from public in Saudi diplomat's killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A Saudi diplomat who was found with
his throat slashed in his apartment here had been repeatedly
stabbed with a thin, sharp blade, police said Friday.
	   The first secretary at the Saudi Arabian Embassy, Abdullah
Al-Ghamdi, 54, was found on the kitchen floor of his apartment at
about 5 p.m. (0700 GMT) Tuesday, after failing to report for work.
	   At a news conference Friday, Australian Federal Police Assistant
Commissioner Bill Stoll would not confirm news reports Al-Ghamdi
had been tortured prior to his death, but Stoll did say the victim
had been stabbed many times.
	   ``This was a brutal crime,'' Stoll said. ``The injuries were
substantial.''
	   Stoll said investigators believe the killing was a domestic
rather than a political matter, but no motive had been ruled out.
	   He said forensic evidence had shown that a sharp, cutting
instrument about two thirds of an inch (15 millimeters) wide had
been used. He said police had been called to a disturbance in the
man's apartment block around the time of the killing, but had gone
to a different apartment.
	   Police issued a description of a car seen leaving the area of
Al-Ghamdi's apartment about 1 a.m. (1500 GMT) Tuesday, around the
time police believe he was killed in the suburb of Kingston.
	   They want to speak to anyone who owns a burgundy colored
two-door Hyundai Excel, or who knows of someone who has such a
vehicle and who may have been acting suspiciously in recent days.
	   He said police are continuing to search for a woman known only
as Layla, who is believed to have been Al-Ghamdi's girlfriend.
	   Al-Ghamdi was entitled to diplomatic immunity and protection in
Australia, Stoll said.
	   ``I'd like to assure the people of Canberra, including the very
many members of the diplomatic community, that Canberra remains a
safe place and every avenue of inquiry will be followed up,'' he
said.

Jakarta Stock Exchange to set up new board for insolvent companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Saddled with companies regarded as
``technically bankrupt,'' the Jakarta Stock Exchange plans to set
up a second-tier board by the end of the year for companies in dire
financial straits.
	   In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires this week, the
exchange's president, Cyril Noerhadi said he wanted to segregate
and differentiate good companies from those that need massive
restructuring.
	   He said the second board will help to restore investor
confidence in the badly shattered Jakarta bourse, which has been
increasingly shunned by international investors as Indonesia
struggles through its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Investors would be able to choose from which board to buy into
depending on their tolerance for risk, he said.
	   One major criticism the bourse has faced since Indonesia's
economy was plunged into crisis in July 1997 is that it allows the
trading of stock in companies with debts far in excess of assets.
	   A large proportion of the listed companies, burdened with hefty
foreign exchange losses and massive interest expenses on their
foreign currency loans, have failed to meet listing requirements
but have yet to be de-listed.
	   Cyril said the second board will theoretically give the
financially crippled companies some breathing space to resuscitate
themselves.
	   ``The general characteristics of the companies (which will be)
on the second board are that they are severely influenced by the
current economic conditions and they have to implement
restructuring programs,'' Cyril said.
	   ``The main problem experienced by these companies is a serious
erosion of their capital or equity,'' Cyril said. ``The losses have
been so great that some have even negative equity.''

World watches as newest nuclear powers open talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The world's newest nuclear powers,
Pakistan and India, open talks on Friday aimed at preventing a
deadly nuclear arms race between the uneasy neighbors.
	   At the heart of the three days of talks is the disputed
territory of Kashmir _ the flash point of two previous wars between
Pakistan and India since 1947 when British colonial rule ended.
	   Analysts here say international pressure, particularly from the
United States, has propelled Pakistan and India to the negotiation
table after more than a year.
	   ``There is a lot of pressure on both countries on the part of
the international community for a long-term commitment,'' said
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's former ambassador to Washington.
	   While Pakistan has been hardest hit by the economic sanctions
that followed May's tit-for-tat nuclear tests by the two countries,
India can't ignore international pressure, said Lodhi.
	   New Delhi ``cannot operate in a vacuum,'' she said.
	   As a result Pakistan is looking to the international community
``to lean much more heavily on the Indians not to do anything to
create pressure for deployment'' of nuclear weapons, she said.
	   Upon his arrival in Pakistan on Thursday, India's Foreign
Secretary K. Raghunath said the two neighbors were on the
``threshold of a new relationship.'' He didn't offer any further
explanation and neither side appears to have moved from their
positions on Kashmir.
	   Pakistan is demanding a vote by Kashmiris on both sides of the
disputed border to decide whether to join Islamic Pakistan or
mostly-Hindu India. Pakistan also wants international mediation to
settle the protracted dispute.
	   India has rejected both.
	   ``There is no room for any third party involvement,'' said
Raghunath at the airport.
	   In an interview earlier this week, Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said it's unlikely any major breakthrough on Kashmir
will emerge from the talks.
	   ``This is a process ... we can't expect a breakthrough on an
issue like this on the first meeting,'' he said.
	   But the fact that both sides are talking, said Aziz, is
indicative that the two countries realize ``something has to be
done.''
	   Both Pakistan and India possess missiles capable of carrying
single and multiple nuclear warheads.
	   ``The world is petrified of an early use,'' says Lodhi.
	   But for Pakistan signing a no-first use pact is untenable
because India has enough conventional fire power to knock out
Pakistan's nuclear facilities and command and control centers.
	   Lodhi said Pakistan would need an agreement that would guarantee
that neither India nor Pakistan would launch a first conventional
strike, similar to a no-war pact.
	   It is in the interest of both countries, she said ``not to go
down the whole deployment road.''

Indonesian Parliament passes law allowing foreign bank ownership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Parliament passed a revised law on
Friday to revitalize the ailing banking sector and to allow foreign
investors to own 100 percent of an Indonesian bank.
	   The new law is regarded as crucial to efforts to restructure
Indonesia's banking industry, crippled by the worst economic crisis
in 30 years.
	   The new law stipulates that foreign ownership of Indonesian
banks will be dealt with only by government foreign investment
regulations.
	   The previous 1992 banking law specifically barred foreigners
from owning any more than 49 percent of stock in an Indonesian
bank.
	   Dozens of insolvent banks have been shut down, merged,
nationalized or placed under government supervision after they
collapsed following a dramatic dive in the value of the rupiah
against the U.S. dollar in July 1997.
	   Indonesia's economy was worst hit by Asia's financial meltdown
and its banks were left in a mess.
	   Some bankers are now being investigated by police over possible
breaches of Indonesia's banking regulations. Several have been
banned from leaving the country.
	   Sjahril Sabirin, the governor of Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, said this week that the majority of Indonesian banks have
insufficient capital levels and will have to be recapitalized.
	   The government has already signaled that several privately-owned
and state-run banks will be put on the market.
	   The new law effectively transfers the power to issue new banking
licenses from the ministry of finance to the central bank.
	   Bank Indonesia will be the sole authority to supervise the
banking sector.
	   The government will also set up deposit insurance agencies to
provide guarantees for customer deposits and to replace the
existing blanket government guarantee on all bank deposits.
	   That guarantee averted massive runs on banks by depositors and
avoided a total collapse of the banking sector.
	   The new law stipulates that all deposits in commercial banks
have to be insured.
	   Stricter penalties will be imposed on bankers found to be
flouting banking regulations.
	   The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency will take on an
extended role as the special agency responsible for the health of
the banking sector.
	   The revised law will also regulate the setting up and running of
banks established under Islamic principles and give a clearer
definition of bank secrecy.
	   Indonesia is the world's largest Islamic nation with about 90
percent of its 202 million people registered as being Muslim.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on this week's
agreement to bring peace to Kosovo, NATO and the Yugoslav military
signed an air surveillance accord to make sure the Yugoslav
president pulls his forces out of the strife-torn province.
	   The deal signed in Belgrade between NATO's Supreme Allied
Commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army
Chief-of-Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic, is the first in a series of
measures designed to force President Slobodan Milosevic to keep his
promise or face airstrikes by the powerful Atlantic alliance.
	   Milosevic agreed this week to withdraw remaining Serb forces
from Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward
self-rule in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000
refugees to return to their homes.
	   His compliance with the breakthrough accord reached with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke will be monitored by unarmed spy planes as
well as some 2,000 ``verifiers.''
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite some progress, Milosevic has a long way to go
to meet NATO's Saturday deadline.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians have been killed and an estimated
300,000 forced to flee their homes since Milosevic began the
crackdown in February. The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also
has killed more than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic
Albanians loyal to Milosevic's government.
	   Some 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians and most favor independence.
	   In Vienna, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe agreed Thursday to oversee the 2,000-member ``ground
verification mission'' _ unarmed monitors who will roam through
Kosovo to make sure terms of the agreement with Holbrooke are being
honored.
	   The OSCE will sign the ground verification agreement today in
Belgrade with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Also, the outgoing Cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was
expected to approve a plan today to contribute 14 German jet
fighters for any NATO attack.
	   Efforts to save Kosovo's refugees from disaster as winter
approaches have been stepped up in the aftermath of the agreement.
But Solana said troops are not being withdrawn fast enough for
refugees to feel confident about going back home.
	   In the town of Kisna Reka, refugees said unarmed monitors will
do them no good. They charged that Serbian security forces fired
machine guns, mortars and other weapons throughout the night,
apparently to intimidate them from returning to their villages.
	   ``There's nobody there'' in the villages, said Fatmir Nuhaj, 27,
his arms wrapped around his young son's shoulders. ``It's only to
keep us from our homes.''
	   The Serbs, for their part, say the KLA is continuing attacks on
police.

Japan stocks surge following Fed rate cut, dollar sinks in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock prices in Tokyo surged Friday on hope the
U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut will prevent a worldwide
recession and keep American demand strong for Japanese products.
The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted its first
gain in four trading days, advancing 285.17 points, or 2.19
percent, to close at 13,280.54. On Thursday, the Nikkei had fallen
75.36 points, or 0.58 percent.
	   Citing concerns over a potential credit crunch, the Fed cut the
overnight rate on loans between banks, the U.S. federal funds rate,
to 5 percent on Thursday. It also lowered the discount rate on its
own loans to banks by a quarter point to 4.75 percent.
	   The surprise move triggered a rally on Wall Street, where the
Dow Jones industrial average closed up 330.58 points, or 4.1
percent, at 8,299.
	   In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on
the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 26.57 points,
or 2.71 percent, to 1,006.68 points. The TOPIX had lost 4.07
points, or 0.41 percent, the day before.
	   Traders cautioned, however, that the gains may prove short-lived
due to lingering worry about Japan's shaky banking system _ and
whether recently passed legislation will be sufficient to stabilize
it.
	   ``The market's direction depends on how the financial
revitalization measures will be implemented, and especially how the
troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan will be dealt with,'' said
Masaru Arai, a general manager at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   Many bank shares rose on optimism the Fed's action would ease a
global tightening of credit, but the stock price of the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. plunged 50 percent to close at
4 yen (dlrs 0.03) after having dipped to a record low 3 yen (dlrs
0.02) in earlier trading.
	   The drop came a day after LTCB issued a statement denying recent
media reports that its debts far exceed assets, which would make
the bank effectively insolvent.
	   Shares of major exporters such as Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor
Corp. were among the biggest gainers. Sony rose 1.88 percent to
close at 8,140 yen (dlrs 70.08) and Toyota soared 6.8 percent to
2,980 yen (dlrs 25.65).
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency bought
116.16 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 2.57 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 116.75
yen overnight.
	   Lower rates make a country's fixed-income securities such as
bonds less attractive to overseas investors, tending to reduce
demand for the currency.
	   The dollar was also weighed down by concern the Fed will have to
cut rates even further to stave off a U.S. economic slowdown,
traders said.
	   ``The dollar was sold on speculation that there will be more
rate cuts and on worries about U.S. corporate earnings,'' said
Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior foreign exchange manager in the Tokyo
office of Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on Japan's benchmark No. 203 10-year
Japanese government bond rose to 0.870 percent from Thursday's
finish of 0.850 percent, driving its price down to 108.28 yen from
108.48 yen.

Asian markets tip their hats to U.S. moves and record big gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Tokyo stocks closing higher, both
Hong Kong and Singapore with 7.5 percent increases at midday.
 &UR; AP Photos TOK102,103

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asia's top three stock markets enjoyed big gains
Friday, including 7.5 percent jumps in Hong Kong and Singapore,
thanks to the unexpected reduction in U.S. interest rates, followed
by a surge on Wall Street.
	   But the dollar took another slide against the yen, which hurts
Asian exporters, and some analysts said it won't take long for
local concerns to override the benefits of America's moves.
	   ``External problems may be eased by the U.S. rate cut, but the
problems remain with Japan's domestic economy,'' said Kenji
Karikomi, a general manager at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
	   Across the board Thursday, the United States provided Asia's
rattled and depressed markets with one good sign after another.
	   For the second time in about two weeks, the U.S. Federal Reserve
cut interest rates by a quarter-point. The surprise reductions
ignited an explosive rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial
average ended the day up 330.58 points, or 4.2 percent, its
third-biggest point gain in history.
	   American economists also speculated that more rate cuts are
imminent as the central bank tries to keep global economic turmoil
from dragging the United States into a recession.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index surged, leaping
669.95 points, or 7.5 percent, to 9,640.37 at midday.
	   Investors hoped that the territory's banks would once again
follow the U.S. lead and reduce interest rates, too. And that
optimism was clearest in property stocks, a sector that led all
others with a 12 percent increase.
	   The Hang Seng Index was hovering at levels not seen since late
May, and volume also was very heavy.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index skyrocketed just as fast.
By midday, a buying frenzy in Singapore had pushed the index up 7.5
percent, or 77.14 points, to 1,101.89, and analysts also credited
the reduction in U.S. interest rates.
	   In Tokyo, following three days of declines, the benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average of 225 issues gained 285.17 points, or 2.2 percent,
to close at 13,280.54.
	   However, the dollar bought 116.45 yen in late morning trading,
down 2.28 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo, and also below its New
York level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen for two weeks, and
that hurts exporters by making their products more expensive
overseas, and reduces the value of their repatriated earnings.
	   The success of key exporters such as Sony, Honda and Fujitsu has
provided Japan one of the few brights spots in its economy, which
is suffering its worst recession since World War II.
	   Despite the stock surge, traders said the outlook of Tokyo's
bourse remains weak. They said expected declines in corporate
earnings and skepticism about new efforts by the government to bail
out troubled banks have left investors pessimistic.
	   ``If anything, we expect the market to move downward in the
short term,'' said Jason James, a strategist at HSBC James Capel
Securities, in Tokyo.

Warne back bowling as Ashes loom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Star legspinner Shane Warne has
bowled a cricket ball for the first time since his shoulder surgery
in May, 10 days before England arrives for the five-test Ashes
tour.
	   Warne, who last week rolled his arm over to bowl a tennis ball,
sent down a few deliveries at Victorian state training, coach John
Scholes said Friday.
	   Warne remains on target to meet England, although Scholes rates
him only a 50-50 chance to play in Victoria's opening Sheffield
Shield match against Tasmania starting Wednesday.
	   The test series against England starts in Brisbane on Nov. 20
but the squad arrived to acclimatize next week.
	   Warne watched his Victorian team play Tasmania in a practice
match Thursday.
	   ``He rolled his arm over after the match a few times and he was
quite happy about it,'' Scholes said. ``He rolled a few off and did
have a bit of a turn,'' he said.
	   Scholes said he would be closely monitoring Warne's progress in
the lead up to the start of the MCG game.
	   ``He's a 50-50 chance, it's a day to day thing at the moment, it
depends how he's going over the next few days,'' Scholes said.
	   Warne, who has a record number of wickets by a spinner, had
surgery to repair torn cartilage and ligaments in his bowling
shoulder after returning from Australia's tour of India and
Sharjah.
	   Initially it was feared he could be out of the game for up to
two years.

Japan's Parliament approves bank bailout plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's upper house of Parliament passed a measure
Friday to remedy the country's crippling financial crisis by
pumping up to half a trillion dollars into the country's ailing
banks.
	   The money will allow the banks to make loans despite huge bad
debts. The troubled banks' tight hold on capital has been a major
factor behind the country's recession, the worst since the end of
World War II.
	   The bank recapitalization bill creates a mechanism for injecting
public money into private banks. An accompanying budget bill, also
approved Friday, creates a war chest of up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs
517 billion) from which the government can draw.
	   The more powerful lower house approved the proposals on Tuesday.
	   The measures are part of a package of bills enacted to repair
Japan's banking system, which is teetering under the weight of up
to dlrs 1 trillion in bad loans _ many of them left over from the
collapse of the speculative ``bubble economy'' of the 1980s.
	   The first part of the plan, enacted Oct. 12, enables the
government to nationalize banks that have failed or are about to go
under. The government is expected to try out the scheme on the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, a lender rumored to be on the verge
of collapse due to debilitating losses from bad real estate loans.
	   The latest law would allow the government to pump funds into
banks that aren't thought to be in danger of failing but still need
assistance. It would also enable healthy banks to obtain public
cash if they agree to use it to pay for taking over the operations
of a foundering lender.
	   Along with the new law, the upper house of parliament approved a
supplementary budget for this year, including 43 trillion yen (dlrs
371 billion) for banks.
	   Of that amount, 25 trillion yen (dlrs 215 billion) was earmarked
to provide capital for weak banks, while 18 trillion yen (dlrs 155
billion) was set aside for the government to purchase failed banks
from their stockholders.
	   The government had already approved a 17 trillion yen (dlrs 147
billion) to strengthen the deposit insurance system against
failures.
	   Japan's banks, among the largest in the world, have been
struggling most of this decade with loans that went sour when the
Japan's ``bubble'' of stock and land speculation broke in the early
1990s.
	   The bad-loan battle has left many reluctant to make new loans,
creating a credit crunch for small- and medium-size companies that
has driven bankruptcies to record highs.
	   Japan's bank problem has been a major drag on the economy.
Economists worry the crisis could further weigh on economically
devastated Asian nations and slow growth globally.

Kidnappers abandon captive businessman in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Under threats of a military
offensive, suspected Muslim rebels on Friday released a Filipino
trader they kidnapped more than a month ago in the southern
Philippines.
	   ``I'm really tired,'' said rice trader Modesto Natividad,
shortly after disembarking from a military helicopter. His captors
had abandoned him in a forest.
	   Natividad, 62, who has apparently lost weight and had two
swollen feet due to continuous walking along mountain trails,
checked into a hospital for further examination.
	   Col. Romeo Calizo, commander of the rescue team, said
Natividad's kidnappers left him in a forest in Sumisip town in
Basilan island, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of this port
city and about 900 kilometers (563 miles) south of Manila.
	   Military spokesman Col. Horacio Lapinid said the abductors left
Natividad for fear of being overrun by government troops who were
closing in on their location.
	   Last week, the rebels had warned that Natividad and another
businessman they kidnapped in July would be killed if ransoms were
not paid.
	   Natividad was taken from his home in Zamboanga by armed men
believed to be former members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
one of two separatist rebel groups battling government forces in
the southern Mindanao region.
	   An Italian priest, the Rev. Luciano Benedetti, the family of a
Taiwanese businessman, two Hong Kong nationals and a Malaysian are
still in captivity after being separately abducted last month in
Mindanao.
	   Ransom kidnappings remain rampant in the Philippines despite a
high-profile government crackdown.

Typhoon Zeb kills seven in Taiwan after lashing Philippines

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES casualties throughout, transport disrupted, scene in
Taipei &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Torrential rains and winds brought by
Typhoon Zeb left seven people dead and three missing in Taiwan on
Friday after killing at least 24 earlier in the Philippines.
	   At 3:00 p.m. (0500 GMT) Zeb was moving north-northeast over
Taiwan at 22 kilometers (13 miles) per hour with sustained winds at
its center of 138 kilometers (86 miles) per hour, said Wu Teh-tung,
deputy director of the Central Weather Bureau's forecasting
division.
	   With the typhoon's skirt already clear of southern Taipei,
forecasters said the storm would abate by mid-evening.
	   Rivers in the Taipei area swelled their banks and low lying
urban areas in Taipei county were severely flooded. Residents were
evacuated by workers patrolling through the night in inflatable
boats.
	   There was little flooding in Taipei, but the capital's streets
were littered with debris from shop signs and downed trees and
motor scooters were blown into piles on sidewalks. Streets were
mostly emptied and all but a few restaurants closed.
	   Trains were stopped by flooding on the tracks north of Taipei
and all domestic and international flights canceled through late
Friday.
	   One woman was drowned in Taipei county, and three persons were
killed in eastern Hualien when their car plunged into a flooded
drainage ditch, the Interior Ministry's disaster rescue center
reported.
	   A man was killed in central Changhua county when a falling tree
threw him from his motor scooter. In southern Tainan, a man riding
a motor bike was killed by a shop sign loosened by raging winds. A
man fishing off a breakwater in southeastern Taitung county was
drowned and three more people were reported missing throughout
Taiwan.
	   Two persons were reported badly injured and 10 treated for light
injuries, the center said. Another 368 were trapped by washed out
roads and bridges, and 183 persons evacuated to government
shelters, including 50 residents of a retirement home in
northeastern Ilan, it said.
	   Losses to agriculture were less than expected, but still totaled
893 million Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 27 million), the Agriculture
Council reported. No property damage estimates were issued.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour and gusts
measuring (295 kilometers) 184 miles per hour.
	   The storm forced 103,000 persons to flee their homes in the
Philippines where Zeb brought rampaging floods and peak sustained
winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour.

Indonesian minister wants to outlaw sorcery as killings continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new, corrected details of police station attack,

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shocked by the mysterious murders of
at least 153 people accused of sorcery, Indonesia's justice
minister wants to outlaw black magic _ a practice in the Southeast
Asian nation since ancient times.
	   During recent months, parts of the main island of Java have been
terrorized by masked killers dressed in black, according to police,
witnesses and media reports.
	   They say the killers strike at night, cutting their victims
throats and sometimes hanging mutilated bodies in trees or tossing
them in the street. Mobs have also attacked and killed people they
accuse of dabbling in black magic.
	   Some of the dead were Muslim clerics. Others were farmers or
ordinary villagers.
	   Police have arrested more than 100 suspects, but acknowledge
there's no clear motive for the grisly slayings.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper Friday quoted Justice Minister Muladi
as saying fear of sorcery has stirred up unrest and violence in
superstitious communities.
	   ``The impact of this issue is very disturbing and it often
claims innocent victims,'' he said.
	   He said anyone who openly claims they can kill or hurt others
with black magic should be punished.
	   ``That would be one way to resolve the witchcraft issue,''
Muladi said.
	   In one attack in Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya,
officers Thursday fired warning shots above protesters when they
stormed a police station in the mistaken belief that one of the
killers had been detained inside.
	   ``People become suspicious of just about anything nowadays,''
said North Surabaya police chief Lt. Col. Sunaryono.
	   The surge in violence has erupted as Indonesia grapples with
political turmoil and the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Violent protests killed about 1,200 people and helped drive
former authoritarian President Suharto from office in May. At that
time members of the mostly Christian or Buddhist ethnic Chinese
minority were targeted because of their relative wealth.
	   However, this new violence is now plaguing the Islamic majority.
Amid the social confusion of the economic crisis _ skyrocketing
inflation, unemployment, poverty and food shortages _ no one is
sure who is doing the killing or why.
	   Police speculate the slayings might be in revenge for the
slaughter of tens of thousands of communists in the mid-1960s when
Suharto took power after an abortive coup attempt. Historians say
Muslim clerics helped the army carry out the carnage.
	   Others believe the killings may represent a bloody power play
before general elections next year.
	   A third possibility is that some Muslim groups want to stamp out
mysticism that still permeates Indonesian society.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.

Asian markets jump following U.S. rate cut

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets soared early Friday as the
surprise cut in U.S. interest rates allayed fears of a global
recession, luring foreign investors back into the region's battered
bourses.
	   But analysts discounted the rallies as a knee-jerk reaction,
saying the extent of the world's financial problems has yet to
unfold.
	   ``Asia is mired in a crisis with massive debts overhanging and
enormous deflation pressure,'' said Andrew Fernow, research
director for Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd. ``To suggest that the
problem can be dealt with overnight or with a few rate cuts in the
U.S. is just absurd.''
	   Despite warnings of looming problems, foreign fund managers
continued to pour money back into Asia.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted
its first gain in four trading days, advancing 285.17 points, or
2.19 percent, to close at 13,280.54. On Thursday, the Nikkei had
fallen 75.36 points, or 0.58 percent.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index soared 7.5 percent to
9,640.37 by midday, on top of Thursday's 1.5 percent gain.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Thursday to reduce interest
rates by a quarter point turned up the heat on the Hong Kong
Association of Banks to cut the deposit rate after its weekly
meeting later Friday.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index also had leapt 7.5 percent
to 1,101.89 by midday.
	   Among other Asian markets, the Philippine's PSE index surged 7
percent to close at 1,437.36; South Korea's Kospi rose 1.4 percent
to 374.01.
	   Thailand's SET index jumped 6.8 percent to 315.25 in early
trading; and Indonesia's key JSX index increased 4.8 percent to
319.304.
	   In Japan, traders cautioned that the gains may prove short-lived
because of lingering worry about the country's shaky banking system
_ and whether recently passed legislation will be sufficient to
stabilize it.
	   ``The market's direction depends on how the financial
revitalization measures will be implemented,'' said Masaru Arai, a
general manager at Ryoko Securities Co.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen. In
mid-afternoon trading, the dollar bought 116.16 yen, down 2.57 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   The Fed surprised markets with its first emergency interest-rate
cuts in more than four years, acknowledging tacitly that its
quarter-point rate cut last month wasn't sufficient to defuse a
looming U.S. credit crunch.
	   The move triggered a rally on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average closed up 330.58 points, or 4.1 percent, at
8,299.
	   Fernow, the research director at Vickers, said the rate cut has
raised an alarm, ignored Friday by investors.
	   ``This suggests a rather desperate attempt to address what could
be a very devastating problem,'' he said.
	   ``We don't know the full extent of the breakdown of the
financial system due to the exposure some financial institutions
have, not only to the emerging markets, but also hedge fund trading
that have kept very secret,'' he said.

Censure motion against defense chief passes upper house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The opposition-dominated upper house of Japan's
Parliament passed a no-confidence motion Friday against the head of
the Defense Agency for a scandal involving overcharging the
government for military equipment.
	   The resolution, which urged agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga to
take responsibility for the scandal, has no binding power. But it
underscored the growing weakness of Japan's ruling party.
	   It was the first time in the five-decade history of Parliament
that a no-confidence vote had passed the upper house, which has
been controlled by opposition parties since elections in July.
	   The measure passed the 252-seat chamber 140-103.
	   Defense agency officials are accused of allowing the overpayment
for defense equipment by suppliers in exchange for securing
post-retirement jobs for retiring agency bureaucrats. Two senior
agency officials have been arrested.
	   Further undermining the agency's credibility are allegations
against other agency officials of hiding or burning documents to
cover up evidence.
	   Nukaga, who is not personally implicated in the scandal, has
refused to step down.
	   ``It's my obligation for the time being to inquire into facts
and implement strict measures,'' he was quoted as saying by Kyodo
News agency. ``I'd like to continue to carry out my duties.''
	   The less powerful upper house is dominated by the opposition,
including the Democratic Party, the Komei party and the Liberal
Party, which submitted the resolution. Two other opposition groups,
the Communists and the Social Democrats, also backed the
resolution.
	   The ruling Liberal Democrats control the majority in the lower
house.

Doctors begin Japan's first authorized sex-change operation

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Doctors removed the breasts, uterus and ovaries of
a 30-year-old woman Friday in the initial stage of Japan's first
legal sex change operation.
	   The woman, who has asked to be identified as K. Nakahara, says
the operation with allow her to finally get a body she can feel is
her own.
	   The surgery, which was performed at Saitama Medical College,
north of Tokyo, was completed successfully, said Haruo Nose, a
spokesman for the medical center.
	   ``The patient is fine,'' Nose said.
	   In a second operation, to be conducted in six months, doctors
will construct male genitals.
	   Nakahara, from northeastern Japan, was quoted by a Tokyo
television station as saying that she had felt uncomfortable with
her gender since her youth and that the operation would give her a
body that was truly hers.
	   In May, the ethics committee at the college approved carrying
out the sex change.
	   The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology said last year
that sex-change operations should be permitted on the condition
that patients undergo psychoanalysis and hormone therapy afterward.

Kazak official: several contenders to run for president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Several candidates are expected to compete in
Kazakstan's presidential election, an official said Friday, though
authoritarian President Nursultan Nazarbayev remains the
overwhelming favorite.
	   Communist leader Serikbolsyn Abdildin and former Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin are among those likely to run in the January
poll, said Kazak Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Tokayev also told a meeting of foreign ambassadors that the
Kazak media is free to publish opposition views, Interfax said.
	   However, Nazarbayev's government had often been criticized by
international human rights groups for restricting the activities of
opposition groups and the media.
	   Kazhegeldin, an opposition candidate, said he was recently shot
at _ though he wasn't hit _ by unidentified assailants. He also
said he's been charged with participation in an unregistered public
gathering earlier this week. He said both incidents were part of a
government effort to prevent him from running.
	   Kazhegeldin, who was in Moscow on Thursday to rally support,
said he was charged for attending a meeting of the Movement for
Fair Elections earlier this month.

Settlers claim security officers beaten by Palestinian police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two civilian Israeli security guards patrolling
a main West Bank road were detained, beaten and fired on by
Palestinian police after chasing rock-throwers into Palestinian-run
territory, Jewish settlers said Friday.
	   A Palestinian security officer denied there was violence.
	   The incident occurred Thursday evening near the Palestinian-run
West Bank town of Ramallah. The security chief for nearby Jewish
settlements and his deputy were patrolling the north-south highway
through the West Bank after repeated incidents of rock-throwing,
according to a settlers' statement.
	   The security officers' car was hit by rocks from a Palestinian
car, the statement said. The two Israelis chased the car into
Ramallah, where, they said, the attackers escaped into the
residence of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The settlers said Abbas' guards stopped the Israeli car, pulled
out the two security guards, confiscated their weapons and
equipment, beat them and fired on them. Later they were taken to
the joint Israeli-Palestinian regional office and released.
	   The Palestinian security officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Israeli vehicle was stopped near Abbas' house
because it appeared suspicious. The officer said the joint command
was called, and its officers escorted the Israelis out.
	   In the West Bank's Gush Etzion settlement bloc south of
Jerusalem, shots were fired from a Palestinian village at a guard
post near an Israeli settlement on Thursday night, Israel radio
reported. No one was injured.
	   Settler leaders are in Washington to accompany the summit
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They briefed one of Netanyahu's
aides about the incident, and advised against handing more
territory over to Arafat under the circumstances.
	   About 160,000 settlers live in the West Bank, among more than
1.5 million Palestinians. The settlers charge that any agreement to
transfer territory to the Palestinians would endanger their
security. Palestinians charge that armed settlers harass and
threaten them.

Education minister agrees on measures to meet student demands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Following a massive demonstration by discontented
high school students, France's education minister said Friday
action would be taken to hire more teachers and modernize schools.
	   Claude Allegre said the moves had been agreed upon during a
meeting with student representatives Thursday, when some 500,000
high school students marched in towns and cities across France.
	   The students' main complaints are overcrowded classrooms, a lack
of modern equipment and heavy course loads. An underlying worry for
many students is the fear of unemployment once they graduate.
	   Allegre said in an interview Friday on Europe-1 radio he and
student leaders had agreed on ``immediate action'' on tackling
overcrowded classrooms, a lack of teachers and outdated facilities.
	   The education minister also said he was ``aghast and sorry''
about violence during Thursday's marches that left at least two
people seriously injured.
	   Measures would be taken against those who disrupted future
demonstrations, Allegre said.
	   Students expressed disappointment Thursday after meeting with
Allegre. More demonstrations are planned for Tuesday. The education
minister also said he would meet with students again next week.

Four Russian children die from food poisoning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four children died after eating contaminated food
at a boarding home near the Siberian prison camp where their
mothers are being held, a news report said. Twenty more children
have fallen ill.
	   Russian prison camps for women traditionally have adjoining
boarding homes for the convicts' small children.
	   Investigators believe that the children at the camp near the
city of Kemerovo contracted salmonella poisoning after eating
contaminated food, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Symptoms of the disease include stomach pains, diarrhea, nausea,
chills, fever and headache. The salmonella bacteria can be killed
by thorough cooking.

Settlers claim security officers beaten by Palestinian police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two civilian Israeli security guards patrolling
a main West Bank road were detained, beaten and fired on by
Palestinian police after chasing rock-throwers into Palestinian-run
territory, Jewish settlers said Friday.
	   A Palestinian security officer denied there was any violence.
	   The incident occurred Thursday evening near the Palestinian-run
West Bank town of Ramallah. The security chief for nearby Jewish
settlements and his deputy were patrolling the north-south highway
through the West Bank after repeated incidents of rock-throwing,
according to a settlers' statement.
	   The security officers' car was hit by rocks from a Palestinian
car, the statement said. The two Israelis chased the car into
Ramallah, where, they said, the attackers escaped into the
residence of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The settlers said Abbas' guards stopped the Israeli car, pulled
out the two security guards, confiscated their weapons and
equipment, beat them and fired on them. Later they were taken to
the joint Israeli-Palestinian regional office and released.
	   The Palestinian security officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Israeli vehicle was stopped near Abbas' house
because it appeared suspicious. The officer said the joint command
was called, and its officers escorted the Israelis out.
	   In the West Bank's Gush Etzion settlement south of Jerusalem,
shots were fired from a Palestinian village at a guard post near an
Israeli settlement on Thursday night, Israel radio reported. No one
was injured.
	   Settler leaders are in Washington to accompany the summit
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They briefed one of Netanyahu's
aides about the incident, and advised against handing more
territory over to Arafat.
	   About 160,000 settlers live in the West Bank, among more than
1.5 million Palestinians. The settlers charge that any agreement to
transfer territory to the Palestinians would endanger their
security. Palestinians charge that armed settlers harass and
threaten them.

Lomu with estranged wife in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Two days after announcing their
split, rugby star Jonah Lomu was beside his wife's hospital bed
Friday following her surgery for ``women's problems.''
	   The All Blacks winger arrived an hour after Tanya Lomu at a
private hospital.
	   Lomu's manager Phil Kingsley-Jones described Tanya Lomu's
condition as ``women's problems'' and said it would be unfair of
him to be more specific.
	   Jonah Lomu announced Wednesday that he had separated from his
22-year-old wife. Kingsley-Jones said they wanted to keep the
matter a secret until after Tanya's operation but broke the news as
media closed in on the story.

Report: Yeltsin cancels visits to Austria, Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating
from an illness, will cancel a trip to Austria later this month and
summit in Malaysia next month, news reports and sources said
Friday.
	   Yeltsin was due to attend the Malaysia summit Nov. 16-17 in
Kuala Lumpur, but has asked Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
replace him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, quoting
unidentified government officials.
	   Yeltsin will also have Primakov go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28
summit of European nations, said Primakov aides who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Yeltsin's office declined to comment on the reports.
	   Yeltsin, 67, came down with a respiratory infection that forced
him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier in the week.
Doctors had ordered him to stay home in bed to recuperate. Yeltsin
was in the Kremlin on Wednesday and Thursday, but was spending
Friday at his country residence outside Moscow.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The presidents of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan met
Friday for talks about the turbulence in neighboring Afghanistan, a
news report said.
	   Former Soviet republics in Central Asia, as well as Russia, are
worried about a possible spillover of violence or an influx of
refugees and weapons from Afghanistan.

us,'' visiting Uzbek President Islam Karimov said before a meeting
with his Turkmen counterpart Saparmurat Niyazov, the Interfax news

	   During the meeting in Turkmenistan's capital Ashgabat, the two
also discussed economic cooperation and the use of the two desert
nations' chief waterway _ the Amu Darya River, the report said.

Ukraine, European Union open meeting in Vienna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma and
senior European Union officials began a one-day meeting Friday
which Kiev hopes will increase cooperation and lead to its eventual
entry into the EU.
	   Representing the European Union are Austrian Chancellor Viktor
Klima, the president of the EU Commission Jacques Santer and the EU
external affairs commissioner, Hans van den Broek.
	   Kuchma arrived in the Austrian capital Thursday for a two-day
visit.
	   During his bilateral meetings Thursday, Kuchma called for a
long-term road map for his country's eventual entry into the EU. He
and the EU officials are expected to sign a cooperation agreement
between the Ukraine and the European Union.
	   Following the meetings, Kuchma will depart for Kiev after formal
departure ceremonies attended by Austrian President Thomas Klestil.
	   Among the issues of concern is Ukraine's nuclear program,
including its plant at Chernobyl, scene of the world's worst
nuclear accident in 1986.
	   Kuchma of reaffirmed Thursday that two new nuclear reactors must
come on line before the Chernobyl plant can be switched off for
good.
	   ``We will switch off Chernobyl when the new blocks are put into
operation,'' Kuchma told the Austria Press Agency, referring to the
fourth reactor at the Rovno nuclear plant and the second reactor at
the Khmelnitskiy power station.
	   He said that his government was in favor of closing down
Chernobyl but that was not possible without providing for
replacement energy.
	   Kuchma spoke of an ``obligation'' by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to grant a dlrs 180 million credit
toward completing the replacement reactors that are ``90 percent
finished.''
	   In the APA interview, Kuchma said it was, therefore, up to the
international community when the switch-off of Chernobyl actually
can take place.
	   However, he stressed, Ukraine was not waiting for disbursement
of the money but was working quietly with Russia toward completing
the two new reactors.

Dollar drops sharply in Tokyo, Japanese stocks surge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon bond and currency prices;
ADDS currency range in 7th graf and stock trading stats in 12th
graf.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell sharply against the yen in
Tokyo trading Friday on worry interest rates will have to be cut
further to stave off an economic slowdown in the United States.
Japanese stock prices rallied.
	   The U.S. currency bought 116.44 yen in late afternoon trading,
down 2.29 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late
New York level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   The drop in the dollar followed the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's
surprise decision Thursday to slash the overnight rate on loans
between banks, the U.S. federal funds rate, to 5 percent. It also
lowered the discount rate on its own loans to banks by a quarter
point to 4.75 percent.
	   Lower rates make a country's fixed-income securities such as
bonds less attractive to overseas investors, tending to reduce
demand for the currency.
	   The U.S. currency's weakening overnight was exacerbated in Tokyo
by concern more rate cuts are likely as the Fed attempts to prevent
the economy from slipping into recession, traders said.
	   ``The dollar was sold on speculation that there will be more
rate cuts and on worries about U.S. corporate earnings,'' said
Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior foreign exchange manager in the Tokyo
office of Sanwa Bank Ltd.
	   In Tokyo trading, the dollar sank as low as 115.40 yen and was
traded as high as 116.75 yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, share prices surged on
hope the Fed's rate cut will prevent a global economic slump and
keep American demand strong for Japanese products, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted its first
gain in four trading days, advancing 285.17 points, or 2.19
percent, to close at 13,280.54. On Thursday, the Nikkei had fallen
75.36 points, or 0.58 percent.
	   Shares of major exporters such as Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor
Corp. were among the biggest gainers. Sony rose 1.88 percent to
close at 8,140 yen (dlrs 70.08) and Toyota soared 6.8 percent to
2,980 yen (dlrs 25.65).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 26.57 points, or
2.71 percent, to 1,006.68 points. The TOPIX had lost 4.07 points,
or 0.41 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 468 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from 409 million issues on Thursday. Advancing shares
exceeded decliners 710 to 384, with 177 issues closing unchanged.
	   Traders cautioned, however, that the gains may prove short-lived
due to lingering worry about Japan's shaky banking system _ and
whether recently passed legislation will be sufficient to stabilize
it.
	   Many bank shares rose on optimism the Fed's action would ease a
global tightening of credit, but the stock price of the ailing
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. plunged 50 percent to close at
4 yen (dlrs 0.03) after having dipped to a record low 3 yen (dlrs
0.02) in earlier trading.
	   The drop came a day after LTCB issued a statement denying recent
media reports that its debts far exceed assets, which would make
the bank effectively insolvent. The bad-loan burdened lender is
widely expected to be nationalized as part of the government's
banking industry reform drive.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on Japan's benchmark No. 203 10-year
Japanese government bond rose to 0.865 percent from Thursday's
finish of 0.850 percent, driving its price down to 108.33 yen from
108.48 yen.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on this week's
agreement to bring peace to Kosovo, Western and Yugoslav officials
were set to sign a second pact in two days Friday providing for
surveillance of the strife-torn province.
	   The head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe flew to Belgrade to sign an accord that will
allow 2,000 unarmed monitors to roam Kosovo _ making sure President
Slobodan Milosevic pulls out his forces as pledged.
	   OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
arrived Friday to sign the ground verification agreement with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. He then was heading
straight to Kosovo to lay the groundwork for the ``verifiers,'' who
mostly will be Europeans.
	   Spy planes are expected to start flying over Yugoslavia shortly
following the signing of an air surveillance accord late Thursday
by NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark,
and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The measures are designed to make sure Milosevic keeps his
promises to withdraw remaining Serb forces from Kosovo and help the
estimated 300,000 displaced ethnic Albanians return to their homes.
	   NATO this week set a Saturday deadline for the Yugoslav leader
to fully comply or face the renewed threat of airstrikes. But NATO
ambassadors were expected later Friday to extend that deadline _
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite the progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   Signifying that the military plan is still in place, the
outgoing Cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to
approve Friday sending 14 German jet fighters for any NATO attack.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush militant resistance in the
southern Serbian province, which is populated predominantly by
ethnic Albanians.
	   The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   On Friday, the head of the first U.S. government team of aid
workers in Kosovo since the agreement was leaving for the Serbian
province. Roy Williams, disaster relief coordinator for the U.S.
Agency for International Development, said he expects the new
``unfettered access'' will speed distribution of aid.
	   He said there is enough food and other supplies to sustain the
scattered population during the winter if they can return to their
homes, but meeting medical needs will be a difficult challenge.

Leftist leader awaits nod to form new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Leftist leader Massimo D'Alema was awaiting the nod
Friday from Italy's president to try and form a new government.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was expected to tap D'Alema after
finishing a round of consultations with political leaders around
midday.
	   D'Alema, 49, leads the Democratic Left, the largest party in
what was _ until a week ago _ the governing Olive Tree majority.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost
the support of hard-line Communists, who said his deficit-cutting
budget didn't do enough to create jobs. On Thursday, Prodi told
Scalfaro he had failed to cobble together a new majority.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of centrist and somehow guarantee their tranquil
coexistence with his Communist allies. Some observers say that
could mean giving cabinet appointments to both.
	   The Communists split during their budget battle with Prodi, with
a breakaway faction led by Armando Cossutta backing him in the
confidence vote. Cossuta's new party, the Italian Communists, has
already given its blessing to a D'Alema, a former Communist
himself.
	   However, the hard-line Communist Refoundation, led by Fausto
Bertinotti, says it will negotiate with D'Alema only if he agrees
to changes in the budget.
	   D'Alema will also have to deal with the centrist party of former
President Francesco Cossiga, who rebuffed Prodi.
	   D'Alema sounded less than optimistic Thursday after Olive Tree
put forth his name. ``I don't know if there is a way out of the
crisis,'' he said.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.

Indonesian foreign minister sees good chance of settling East Timor
</HEADLINE>
conflict

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia now has a good opportunity
to resolve the 23-year-old bloody conflict in East Timor, Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas was reported Friday as saying.
	   ``(We) need a compromise effort that is acceptable to all
parties,'' Alatas said, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   Alatas was speaking after hosting a meeting of 39 pro- and 19
anti-Indonesian leaders from East Timor, a former Portuguese colony
invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the following year.
	   At the two-day meeting, which ended Friday on the tourist island
of Bali, Alatas detailed an Indonesian proposal to grant autonomy,
but not independence, to the troubled territory.
	   The plan is now the subject of U.N.-sponsored talks between
Indonesia and Portugal.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim that
East Timor is one of its provinces. Since the invasion, East Timor
has endured years of human rights abuse and guerrilla war.
	   A new push to solve the conflict has emerged following the
resignation of authoritarian President Suharto after a wave of
protests and riots swept Indonesia last May.
	   Suharto ordered the 1975 invasion and had steadfastly refused
demands for East Timorese self-determination.
	   Absent from the Bali gathering was 1996 Nobel Peace laureate
Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, East Timor's spiritual leader.
	   Belo, who has repeatedly urged Indonesia to withdraw its troops
from East Timor as part of any peace plan, told reporters he was
too busy attending to church matters to meet Alatas.
	   Friday's meeting followed big protests Sunday and Monday in East
Timor's capital, Dili.
	   Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanded a referendum be held
on the territory's future.
	   Indonesia has rejected demands for a referendum and instead
maintains that the granting of autonomy be accepted a permanent
solution.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A group of Japanese chemical companies will file a
complaint against three foreign rivals for allegedly selling
products in Japan at prices lower than in their home markets, one
of the companies said Friday.
	   The five Japanese companies were making final preparations to
lodge the complaint with the Japanese government seeking
antidumping tariffs on acrylonitrile imports, said Morio Sako, a
spokesman at Asahi Chemical Industry Co.
	   ``We think the three foreign makers are exporting to Japan at
unfairly lower prices, and that it hurts Japanese manufacturers,''
Sako said.
	   Joining Asahi Chemical in the complaint are Mitsubishi Chemical
Corp., Mitsui Chemicals Inc., Sumitomo Chemical Co. and Showa Denko
K.K., Sako said.
	   The Japanese companies will complain that BP Chemicals of the
United States, Tae-Kwang Industrial Co. of South Korea and a South
African company were selling acrylonitrile in Japan at prices about
30 percent lower than at home.

	   SHANGHAI (AP) _ Officials in southern China's Guangdong province
have suspended 15 futures trading companies from accepting new
clients and ordered the companies to close all positions and return
all margin deposits to clients by December 31, 1998, the Shenzhen
Securities Times reported Friday.
	   The suspensions were the latest move in a clean up of the
China's fledgling financial futures markets.
	   The Guangdong Securities Regulatory Commission demanded complete
records of futures trading positions and use of investors' funds as
well as a plan to cover positions and return margin requirements to
investors, the newspaper reported.
	   Names of the companies under investigation were not disclosed.
	   In August, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced
plans to merge China's 14 futures exchanges into three and close
all but 12 of China's 35 futures contracts. The CSRC has also shut
down a number of futures brokerages for trading irregularities and
misappropriation of funds.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Parliament passed a revised law on
Friday to revitalize the ailing banking sector and to allow foreign
investors to own 100 percent of an Indonesian bank.
	   The new law is regarded as crucial to efforts to restructure
Indonesia's banking industry that's been crippled by the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The new law stipulates that foreign ownership of Indonesian
banks will be dealt with only by government foreign investment
regulations.
	   The previous 1992 banking law specifically barred foreigners
from owning any more than 49 percent stock in an Indonesian bank.
	   Dozens of insolvent banks have been shut down, merged,
nationalized or placed under government supervision after they
collapsed following a dramatic dive in the value of the rupiah
against the U.S. dollar in July 1997.
	   Indonesia's economy was worst hit by Asia's financial meltdown
and its banks were left in a mess.
	   Some bankers are now being investigated by police over possible
breaches of Indonesia's banking regulations. Several have been
banned from leaving the country.
	   Sjahril Sabirin, the governor of Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, said this week that the majority of Indonesian banks have
insufficient capital levels and will have to be recapitalized.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's currency rose to its highest
level against the U.S. dollar in 11 months, while the stock market
was up 6.8 percent Friday.
	   The strengthening of the Thai baht was in line with most
regional currencies after a sudden cut in U.S. interest rates,
dealers said.
	   At mid-morning Friday the baht stood at 37.85, down from 37.90
to the U.S. dollar at the close of trading Thursday. The baht was
at its highest level against the dollar since Nov. 10 last year.
	   Thai share prices were up 6.8 percent at the open Friday in line
with the overnight jump on Wall Street and morning rallies on East
Asian markets as investors welcomed the U.S. Federal Reserve's cut
of lending rates.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand was up 20.06 points to 315.25,
from Thursday's close of 295.19. Advancing shares were out pacing
declines 147 to 3.
	   The Asian economic crisis began in Thailand in mid-1997 with a
devaluation of the baht which had long stood at around 25 baht to
the U.S. dollar.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Saddled with companies regarded as
``technically bankrupt,'' the Jakarta Stock Exchange plans to set
up a second-tier board by the end of the year for companies in dire
financial straits.
	   In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires this week, the
exchange's president, Cyril Noerhadi said he wanted to segregate
and differentiate good companies from those that need massive
restructuring.
	   He said the second board will help to restore investor
confidence in the badly shattered Jakarta bourse, which has been
increasingly shunned by international investors as Indonesia's
struggles through its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Investors would be able to choose from which board to buy into
depending on their tolerance for risk, he said.
	   One major criticism the bourse has faced since Indonesia's
economy was plunged into crisis in July 1997 is that it allows the
trading of stock in companies with debts far in excess of assets.
	   A large proportion of the listed companies, burdened with hefty
foreign exchange losses and massive interest expenses on their
foreign currency loans, have failed to meet listing requirements
but have yet to be de-listed.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's upper house of Parliament passed a measure
Friday to remedy the country's crippling financial crisis by
pumping up to half a trillion dollars into the country's ailing
banks.
	   The money will allow the banks to make loans despite huge bad
debts. The troubled banks' tight hold on capital has been a major
factor behind the country's recession, the worst since the end of
World War II.
	   The bank recapitalization bill creates a mechanism for injecting
public money into private banks. An accompanying budget bill, also
approved Friday, creates a war chest of up to 60 trillion yen (dlrs
517 billion) from which the government can draw.
	   The more powerful lower house approved the proposals on Tuesday.
	   The measures are part of a package of bills enacted to repair
Japan's banking system, which is teetering under the weight of up
to dlrs 1 trillion in bad loans _ many of them left over from the
collapse of the speculative ``bubble economy'' of the 1980s.
	   The first part of the plan, enacted Oct. 12, enables the
government to nationalize banks that have failed or are about to go
under. The government is expected to try out the scheme on the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, a lender rumored to be on the verge
of collapse due to debilitating losses from bad real estate loans.
	   The latest law would allow the government to pump funds into
banks that aren't thought to be in danger of failing but still need
assistance. It would also enable healthy banks to obtain public
cash if they agree to use it to pay for taking over the operations
of a foundering lender.
	   Along with the new law, the upper house of parliament approved a
supplementary budget for this year, including 43 trillion yen (dlrs
371 billion) for banks.

Poles on Roman pilgrimage pay tribute to their hero

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Streaming into St. Peter's Square after long
journeys from their homeland, thousands of Poles paid a heartfelt
tribute Friday to Pope John Paul II, their compatriot and hero who
was elected pontiff exactly 20 years ago.
	   The leader of Poland's Catholic church, Warsaw Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, who was made a cardinal by John Paul, led the celebration,
which included traditional songs performed by Polish girls in
colorful skirts.
	   At 6:44 p.m., on Oct. 16, 1978, the word that Karol Wojtyla,
archbishop of Krakow, in then Communist Poland, was chosen to lead
the Roman Catholic church was delivered to crowds in the same
cobblestoned square.
	   The announcement that the church had its first non-Italian pope
in 455 years astonished the world and worried many authorities in
the Soviet bloc who feared that the then-58-year-old, handsome and
dynamic churchman would keep his influence on his homeland.
	   John Paul used his moral stature to help Poles stay the course
during the dark years of a military crackdown against the
Solidarity free trade movement in the early 1980s.
	   ``It's a great holiday. We came to show Polish solidarity with
this pope,'' said a middle-aged Pole who made a 13-hour bus journey
from her home in Opole in southern Poland to attend the special
Polish tribute and Mass in St. Peter's Square.
	   Before she could give her name, the woman was hustled off by the
leader of her pilgrimage group which arrived after the start of the
Mass, attended by about 20,000 Poles.
	   Friday was an official Vatican holiday, and tourists were told
they would have to wait until mid-afternoon to enter the basilica.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Streaming into St. Peter's Square after long
journeys from their homeland, thousands of Poles paid a heartfelt
tribute Friday to Pope John Paul II, their compatriot and hero who
was elected pontiff exactly 20 years ago.
	   The leader of Poland's Catholic church, Warsaw Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, who was made a cardinal by John Paul, led the celebration,
which included traditional songs performed by Polish girls in
colorful skirts.
	   At 6:44 p.m., on Oct. 16, 1978, the word that Karol Wojtyla,
archbishop of Krakow, in then Communist Poland, was chosen to lead
the Roman Catholic church was delivered to crowds in the same
cobblestoned square.
	   The announcement that the church had its first non-Italian pope
in 455 years astonished the world and worried many authorities in
the Soviet bloc who feared that the then-58-year-old, handsome and
dynamic churchman would keep his influence on his homeland.
	   John Paul used his moral stature to help Poles stay the course
during the dark years of a military crackdown against the
Solidarity free trade movement in the early 1980s.
	   ``It's a great holiday. We came to show Polish solidarity with
this pope,'' said a middle-aged Pole who made a 13-hour bus journey
from her home in Opole in southern Poland to attend the special
Polish tribute and Mass in St. Peter's Square.
	   Before she could give her name, the woman was hustled off by the
leader of her pilgrimage group which arrived after the start of the
Mass, attended by about 20,000 Poles.
	   Friday was an official Vatican holiday, and tourists were told
they would have to wait until mid-afternoon to enter the basilica.

 &UR; Taylor hits double century &QL; 
 &UR; By Rizwan Ali &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Mark Taylor hit a double century and
put Australia on the road to a big first innings total against
Pakistan on the second day of the second cricket Test Friday.
	   The Australian captain, who played a record second wicket
partnership with Justin Langer, remained unbeaten at 215 _ just
four short from his career-best 219 made against England at Trent
Bridge in 1989.
	   Mark Waugh was also looking to regain his form with an
unconquered 29 when the teams broke for lunch at 388 for two.
	   Taylor has so far hit 23 boundaries and a six during his
marathon 499 minutes of stay at the wicket. He hit his second
double hundred with a straight drive off leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed
to the long-on boundary.
	   After Australia resumed at the overnight total of 224 for one,
Justin Langer, took another 15 deliveries before he completed his
maiden Test century in his 10th Test.
	   Pakistan's lone success came when medium fast bowler Azhar
Mahmood delivery had Langer caught behind by Moin Khan. But by
then, Taylor and Langer had added 279 runs for the second wicket
stand.
	   They broke the previous best Australian second wicket
partnership record of 259 made by Wayne Phillips and Graham Yallop
at Perth in 1983-84.
	   Taylor, who was dropped twice by Saeed Anwar on the first day,
batted solidly and Pakistan bowlers failed to break his defenses
even with a second new ball. During the game, Taylor completed his
7,000 Test runs in his 98th Test.

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble on Friday won
the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to resolve the Northern
Ireland conflict culminating in the peace agreement signed this
spring.
	   They were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward
ending ``the national religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April also was the work of other Northern Ireland
political leaders, as well as the governments of the United
Kingdom, the United States and Ireland.
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on this week's
agreement to bring peace to Kosovo, Western and Yugoslav officials
were set to sign a second pact in two days Friday providing for
surveillance of the strife-torn province.
	   The head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe flew to Belgrade to sign an accord that will
allow 2,000 unarmed monitors to roam Kosovo _ making sure President
Slobodan Milosevic pulls out his forces as pledged.
	   OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
arrived Friday to sign the ground verification agreement with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. He then was heading
straight to Kosovo to lay the groundwork for the ``verifiers,'' who
mostly will be Europeans.
	   Spy planes are expected to start flying over Yugoslavia shortly
following the signing of an air surveillance accord late Thursday
by NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark,
and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The measures are designed to make sure Milosevic keeps his
promises to withdraw remaining Serb forces from Kosovo and help the
estimated 300,000 displaced ethnic Albanians return to their homes.
	   NATO this week set a Saturday deadline for the Yugoslav leader
to fully comply or face the renewed threat of airstrikes. But NATO
ambassadors were expected later Friday to extend that deadline _
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite the progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   Signifying that the military plan is still in place, the
outgoing Cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to
approve Friday sending 14 German jet fighters for any NATO attack.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush militant resistance in the
southern Serbian province, which is populated predominantly by
ethnic Albanians.
	   The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   On Friday, the head of the first U.S. government team of aid
workers in Kosovo since the agreement was leaving for the Serbian
province. Roy Williams, disaster relief coordinator for the U.S.
Agency for International Development, said he expects the new
``unfettered access'' will speed distribution of aid.
	   He said there is enough food and other supplies to sustain the
scattered population during the winter if they can return to their
homes, but meeting medical needs will be a difficult challenge.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's upper house of parliament
selected Gov. Hans Eichel of Hesse state as its new president
Friday, replacing Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder.

presidency each year among the state governors. Schroeder was
governor of Lower Saxony until being elected chancellor Sept. 27.
	   Eichel, a Social Democrat like Schroeder, has been governor of
Hesse since 1991.
	   The Bundesrat president exercises the powers of the German

Mahathir defends use of currency controls

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with comments from Mahathir on currency
controls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister defended his use of
currency controls on Friday, saying his country would keep
regulating the flow of money across its borders to step speculative
trading, news reports said.
	   Mahathir Mohamad, on a five-day visit to Japan, was quoted as
saying that controls he imposed last month had created a more
predictable environment for doing business.
	   ``Certainly for Malaysia, it has done a lot of good to our
domestic economy,'' the Malaysian leader was quoted as saying by
the Malaysian national news agency, Bernama.
	   Mahathir spoke in Tokyo at a press conference closed to
reporters from outside Japan or Malaysia.
	   The Malaysian was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency that his
government would continue with the policy until the international
community steps in to regulate currency trading.
	   Malaysia enacted strict controls Sept. 1 to peg its currency to
the U.S. dollar, ban trading of Malaysian shares in foreign
markets, and restrict capital flows in and out of the country.
	   The measures contradicted prescriptions from the International
Monetary Fund for restoring economic health to the country, though
they took immediate pressure off the beleaguered local currency and
stock markets.
	   Many economists have criticized the steps, saying they will rob
the country of valuable foreign investment.
	   Mahathir arrived in Japan on Friday for private meetings with
business executives and politicians on his first trip abroad since
he set off an explosive political battle by firing his former
protege, deputy prime minister and finance minister Anwar Ibrahim,
on Sept. 2.
	   Anwar went on a campaign for political reform after being fired,
but was arrested and is now facing trial on 10 counts of corruption
and illegal homosexual acts.
	   Malaysian officials refused to provide details on Mahathir's
visit, saying only that he had a full schedule of private meetings
with bankers, businessmen and politicians.
	   The meetings were expected to include discussions on loans from
Japan to help Malaysia deal with its economic problems.
	   Despite a deep recession of its own, Japan has provided billions
of dollars in financial support to Asian countries since the
region's financial crisis began more than a year ago.
	   Of the dlrs 30 billion aid package for Southeast Asia and South
Korea that Tokyo recently announced, dlrs 2 billion has been
allotted for Malaysia.
	   While in Japan, Mahathir was scheduled to attend a reception on
Monday given by Emperor Akihito for those attending an African
development conference.

Yeltsin cancels foreign trip

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin canceling Asian trip, sources saying it's
because of health concerns, comments by Moscow mayor on Yeltsin's
health. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still
recuperating from his latest illness, has canceled a trip to an
Asian summit next month, his office said Friday.
	   Government sources said the president has also called off a
visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans
were still going forward.
	   Yeltsin has decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to
the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala
Lumpur because it deals mostly with financial issues, Yeltsin's
office said.
	   But sources in Primakov's office said the cancellation was due
to concerns about how the long flight might effect the president's
health.
	   The president has been suffering from bronchitis and a cold this
week, which forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia on
Monday.
	   He was spending Friday at a country home outside Moscow after
defying the orders of his doctors and working in the Kremlin for
the past two days. Aides said the president's condition was
``satisfactory.''
	   Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28
summit of European nations, the president's office said.
	   In another development, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered a
potential presidential candidate, said Thursday that he wouldn't
exclude the possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health
reasons.
	   In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he stopped
short of calling on Yeltsin to step down. But Luzhkov has always
been supportive of Yeltsin and had never before questioned the
president's health or ability to govern.
	   ``According to our constitution, the president himself has to
say he is not able to work,'' Luzhkov said in an interview with the
BBC in Moscow. ``And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, he is no
longer able to give the country as much time as it demands.''
	   Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on
the statement.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of health problems, including a heart
bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles
speculation about his fitness to govern.
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health
problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.

Government strikes asylum seeker camp after storm _ of criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ERMELO, Netherlands (AP) _ A controversial camp of army tents
housing asylum seekers on a windswept heath will be dismantled
after it provoked a storm of criticism that refugees were being
held in inhumane conditions.
	   But with the government struggling to find accommodation for a
growing flood of refugees, the campers will be moved from one set
of tents to another. Soldiers were Friday setting up a new camp _
with better tents _ near the eastern city of Nijmegen.
	   Earlier this week, about 50 tents were pitched near Ermelo, a
town 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Amsterdam. The camp, which
housed about 80 people under army and police guard, was equipped
with portable toilets and a single water tank.
	   The move was a public relations disaster for the government as a
heavy storm on the first night exposed leaky tents and turned the
heath into muddy marshland.
	   The new camp near Nijmegen is expected to open Saturday and
provide shelter for up to 900 people.
	   Through September, 31,466 refugees have applied for permission
to stay in the Netherlands this year. That's 30 percent more than
the same period a year ago. By the end of the year, some officials
fear that number could swell to 50,000, creating a shortage of
space in Europe's most densely populated nation.
	   Dutch media also reported Friday that a Rwandan mother and her
two young children were dumped on the street by justice authorities
because they had no right to asylum in the Netherlands.
	   The family were the first victims of a tougher Dutch asylum
policy. Because the Hutus had come to the Netherlands by train from
Belgium, authorities now say they must apply for asylum there.

German parliament votes on NATO deployment

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from parliament session. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ NATO must keep up pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to make him comply with this week's
peace deal for Kosovo, Germany's outgoing foreign minister said
Friday.
	   Klaus Kinkel's warning was aimed in part at Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat whose future government
includes the Greens, a party with a significant pacifist wing.
	   ``Milosevic only reacts to military pressure,'' Kinkel said in a
speech to parliament. ``One must not send the wrong signal to
Belgrade through disunity and half-hearted measures.''
	   The outgoing parliament later Friday was expected to approve
German participation in any NATO military action against Milosevic.
	   With Schroeder's agreement, the outgoing Cabinet on Monday
approved sending 14 German jet fighters for any NATO attack aimed
at forcing Milosevic to withdraw weapons from Kosovo province.
	   That decision also requires parliamentary approval, but the
newly elected legislature is not to convene until Oct. 26. So a
special session of the outgoing parliament was called.
	   Karsten Voigt, the Social Democrats' foreign policy spokesman,
wholeheartedly backed German participation in the NATO military
threat against Milosevic despite the agreement easing the threat of
airstrikes.
	   ``Any other policy would have isolated Germany in the alliance
and in Europe, and it would have rewarded those who use violence,''
he told the meeting.
	   In committee meetings Thursday, lawmakers from both Schroeder's
Social Democrats and outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
coalition supported the decision.
	   Several Greens lawmakers abstained, arguing that NATO action
without an explicit U.N. mandate would violate international law.
But others said they would support Greens party leader Joschka
Fischer in backing NATO action.
	   Schroeder is expected to name Fischer as his foreign minister.
	   Despite an agreement this week easing the threat of air strikes
against Yugoslavia, Kohl's defense minister, Volker Ruehe, said the
vote was still needed. ``The sword must remain visible,'' he said.

Typhoon Zeb heads for Japan after hitting the Philippines hard

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A weakened typhoon Zeb approached islands in
southern Japan on Friday after killing at least 74 people in the
Philippines and six in Taiwan in a trail of destruction.
	   With maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph), Zeb was
located about 190 kilometers (118 miles) west of the island of
Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture, as of 4:00 p.m. (0800 GMT), Japan's
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The typhoon was moving north-northeast at about 20 kph (12 mph)
in the East China Sea, the agency said. Weather reports forecast
rain for most of western and central Japan over the weekend.
	   At least 35 domestic flights to southern Japanese destinations
were canceled Friday, airline officials said.
	   Disaster officials in the Philippines said the typhoon left at
least 74 people dead, mostly due to drownings and landslides. At
least one person died of electrocution, while another was bitten by
a snake. Ten people were missing.
	   The casualty figure is expected to rise because several mountain
villages in the northern Philippines remain isolated. President
Joseph Estrada flew Friday to the Cagayan Valley region, one of the
hardest-hit areas, to inspect the damage.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   Among the dead were two young brothers _ ages 2 and 4 _ killed
when a hill unleashed tons of mud and debris on the town of
Antipolo, just outside Manila. Their 6-year-old sister survived.
	   In Benguet province, at least 10 people were killed and an
undetermined number were missing after boulders, mud and debris
crashed down a mountain and buried workers' quarters of the Luzon
Hydroelectric Cooperative.
	   In nearby Baguio City, five people died in separate landslides,
and a 30-year-old South Korean student was killed when a section of
road collapsed, plunging his car into a ravine, said Chief
Inspector Ricardo Villena.
	   ``There are so many reports of landslides that will keep us busy
for a while,'' Villena said.
	   At least five provinces have been declared in a state of
calamity, to allow emergency funds to be released to these areas.
Price control also has been established to prevent profiteers from
taking advantage of the situation.
	   In Taiwan, six people were dead and four missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Rivers in the Taipei area swelled their banks, and low lying
urban areas in Taipei county were flooded by torrential rains.
Residents were evacuated to safety by rescue workers patrolling
through the night in inflatable boats.
	   One woman was reportedly drowned in Taipei, and two persons were
killed in eastern Hualien county when their car plunged into a
flooded drainage ditch, the Interior Ministry's disaster rescue
center reported.
	   A man was killed in central Changhua county when a falling tree
threw him from his motor scooter. In southern Tainan, a man riding
a motor bike was killed by a shop sign loosened by raging winds. A
man fishing off a breakwater in southeastern Taitung county was
drowned and four more people were reported missing throughout
Taiwan.
	   One person was reported badly injured and nine treated for light
injuries, the center said.
	   Schools and offices were closed in most parts of the island
Friday, and the stock exchange also suspended trading in the
capital of Taipei.
	   Among the four other people killed, one was smashed by a fallen
billboard and one by a fallen tree. One person was swept out to sea
by two-story high waves while fishing, while another died after
being trapped overnight in heavy rain.
	   Many international flights were canceled, and others arriving in
Taipei were rerouted to Hong Kong, airport officials said.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour and gusts
measuring (295 kilometers) 184 miles per hour.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers drowned and
80 missing and presumed dead.

	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian center Steve Renouf
scored two tries Friday as the Kangaroos beat New Zealand 36-16 to
claim their rugby league test series 2-1.
	   New Zealand won the opening test in April and was trying to beat
Australia in a series for the first time since 1953.
	   But a rejuvenated Australian team under coach Wayne Bennett, who
replaced Bob Fulton following the opening test loss, stormed to two
convincing wins a week apart.
	   Renouf was one of several Australians, including Bennett and
captain Allan Langer, who claimed trebles after winning the
National premiership for Brisbane and State of Origin series for
Queensland also this year.
	   ``It has been a fantastic series, the Kiwis were very tough and
they played very well,'' said Langer, who had been dropped for the
first test.
	   New Zealand leaves Friday for a three-test series against
Britain and is sure to look positively at its performance despite
losing the series.
	   ``We got well beaten, it was very frustrating, but all isn't
doom and gloom for us,'' Kiwis second rower Stephen Kearney said.
``The young guys came through well and we'll go away to Britain
knowing we've got a lot to work on.''
	   Kiwi captain Quentin Pongia was also looking ahead.
	   ``We would have really liked to have won this. It is really
disappointing but we've got three tests against the Poms and the
young blokes like Tony Puletua and Nathan Cayless showed they have
got it,'' Pongia said.
	   Australia led 16-8 at half-time and the Kiwis tried hard to stay
in touch. But the visitors made sure of the win with an
exhilarating try to Darren Smith, who finished it off in the
right-hand corner after the ball was pushed through 15 sets of
hands.
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 36 (Steve Renouf 2, Jason Hetherington, Jason Smith,
Darren Smith, Brad Thorn, Darren Lockyer tries; Lockyer 3 goals,
Andrew Johns 1 goal) def. New Zealand 16 (Daryl Halligan, Tony
Puletua tries; Halligan 4 goals).

Police fire warning shots as mob attacks police station

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Officers fired warning shots when
protesters attacked a police station after mistaking three
out-of-town detectives as suspects in a bizarre murder spree case,
police and news reports said Friday.
	   Three people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds, The Surabaya
Post newspaper reported.
	   Six people were arrested during Wednesday night's attack on the
station at Semampir, just outside of Indonesia's second most
populous city, Surabaya.
	   Witnesses said police fired a volley of shots above the mob as
it forced its way into the station, apparently wanting to lynch
those they had mistaken as suspects in the mysterious killings of
Muslim clergy and alleged sorcerers.
	   The daily Kompas reported that six policemen were injured by the
stone-throwing mob.
	   ``It was merely a misunderstanding,'' said an officer at the
badly damaged station. He spoke on condition of anonymity and gave
no further details.
	   However, East Java police spokesman Lt. Col. Sutrisno denied
anyone was hurt.
	   Surabaya, about 400 miles (650 kilometers) east of Jakarta, is
the capital of East Java province, where more than 100 people have
been murdered.
	   During recent months, parts of main island of Java been
terrorized by the slayings of at least 153 people by masked killers
dressed in black.
	   Police have said the killers strike at night, cutting their
victims throats and sometimes hanging mutilated bodies in trees or
tossing them in the street.
	   Most of the victims were Muslim preachers or had been accused of
dabbling in black magic. Police say they have yet to establish a
clear motive for the killings.

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from Hume, Sejersted, laureates' ages. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble on Friday won
the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to resolve the
three-decade-old Northern Ireland conflict culminating in the peace
agreement signed this spring.
	   They were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward
ending ``the national religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April also was the work of other Northern Ireland
political leaders, as well as the governments of the United
Kingdom, the United States and Ireland.
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54.
	   Hume, contacted by Norwegian television NRK, said he believes
the prize will ``strengthen our peace process enormously.''
	   That outlook was echoed by Norwegian Nobel Committee head
Francis Sjerested, who said after the announcement that the
committee hoped the award would ``give (the peace process) a push
forward.''
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Philippines shares rise, peso strengthens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares ended sharply
higher Friday, buoyed by a surprise cut in key U.S. interest rates
late Thursday that led to huge overnight gains on Wall Street.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed up 94.58
points, or 7 percent, at 1437.36, following a gain of 18.56-points,
or 1.4 percent, Thursday.
	   Except for the loss suffered by the main index Wednesday, the
market has been on the rise since Oct. 6, with the main market
indicator gaining a total of 314.37 points so far.
	   Traders said Manila shares took their cue from the decision by
the U.S. Federal Reserve late Thursday to lower the target for the
Fed Funds rate by a quarter-percentage point to 5.0 percent, while
also cutting the discount rate by the same margin to 4.75 percent.
	   The rate cuts came as a surprise since the U.S. Federal Reserve
normally does not adjust interest rates in between its regular
board meetings, traders said. The latest rate cuts also closely
followed reductions in key U.S. rates instituted by the U.S.
Federal Reserve last month.
	   Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities Inc., said the
prospect of the latest U.S. rate cuts encouraging investment
portfolio managers to look to emerging markets like those in Asia
sent Manila shares on an upswing.
	   ``Our market coming from a low base also helped us a lot during
Friday's rally,'' he said.
	   At the Philippine Dealing System, the Philippine peso finished
stronger Friday, lifted by the yen's advance against the dollar
following the Federal Reserve's move to cut interest rates.
	   The dollar averaged 42.987 pesos, down from Thursday's average
of 43.23 pesos. The dollar was last dealt at 42.92 pesos.
	   Volume swelled to dlrs 138.5 million from the previous session's
dlrs 97 million.
	   If the yen gains more ground, traders said the peso will likely
advance against the dollar as well.
	   The central bank wasn't active in the spot market.
	   Kane, however, was quick to point out that the run-up being
experienced by Asian stock markets shouldn't be taken as a sign
that all is well again.
	   He said regional economies remain weak and there is a growing
threat this may eventually lead to a global meltdown.

Dutch unemployment continues to decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Registered unemployment in the
Netherlands fell to an unadjusted 4 percent in the three-month
period ending Sept. 30, down from 5.4 percent in the same period a
year ago, the government said Friday.
	   The total number of unemployed people dropped to 271,000, a
sharp decline from 372,000 in the same period in 1997, according to
the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.
	   Adjusted for seasonal influences, the third-quarter jobless rate
fell to 3.9 percent, down from 5.4 percent a year earlier and down
from 4.1 percent in the previous three months ended August.
	   The total number of unemployed reached an adjusted 270,000 in
the latest reporting period, down from 370,000 in the same period a
year ago and from 279,000 in the period ended August.
	   The CBS pointed out that this rate of unemployment decline has
continued in the past two years.

Japan's Foreign Minister to work on World War II peace treaty with
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will
spend the weekend working toward a World War II peace treaty with
Russia, which the two countries have never signed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be
signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over the
Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the
disagreement on the Kuril Islands despite the overall improvement
in relations.
	   In an interview published Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese
relations have made progress due to summits between Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin and Japan's former-Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura, who was to arrive in Moscow on Friday night, is expected
to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and other top officials, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The visit comes one day after Russia's parliament voted to
reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in World War II.
The holiday had been dropped after the Soviet collapse.
	   The upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, agreed
to reestablish the Day of Victory Over Militarist Japan, which
marks the Soviet Union's defeat of Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The measure, which has already been approved by the lower house,
requires President Boris Yeltsin's signature to become law.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble on Friday won
the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to resolve the
three-decade-old Northern Ireland conflict culminating in the peace
agreement signed this spring.
	   They were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward
ending ``the national religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April also was the work of other Northern Ireland
political leaders, as well as the governments of the United
Kingdom, the United States and Ireland.
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54.
	   Hume, contacted by Norwegian television NRK, said he believes
the prize will ``strengthen our peace process enormously.''
	   That outlook was echoed by Norwegian Nobel Committee head
Francis Sjerested, who said after the announcement that the
committee hoped the award would ``give (the peace process) a push
forward.''
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

John Hume says Nobel prize is endorsement of process

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ John Hume, joint winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize, said Friday that the honor represents ``very
powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern
Ireland.''
	   Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which
gets the largest share of votes from Northern Ireland's Roman
Catholic minority, worked tirelessly in pursuit of a cease-fire by
the Irish Republican Army and for all-party negotiations.
	   He shared the prize with David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, which gets the largest share of Protestant votes.
	   ``I think that today's announcement from the Nobel committee
strengthens our peace process enormously because it tells all the
people what the world want to see on our streets,'' Hume told a
news conference in Belfast.
	   He said the most powerful support for the process came from the
people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, who
overwhelmingly approved the peace agreement in a referendum in May.
	   ``The international community in its different ways has also
expressed its support, but today's annoucement from Norway by the
Nobel peace committee to David Trimble and myself is a very clear
and powerful statement of approval for the peace process and of the
international goodwill that exists for us.
	   ``And as I have said often to many of you recently, the
challenge to all of us now, as public representatives in Northern
Ireland from all parties, is to harness that international goodwill
for the benefit of all our people, particularly our young people,''
Hume said.

Government strikes asylum seeker camp after storm of criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ERMELO, Netherlands (AP) _ A controversial camp of army tents
housing asylum seekers on a windswept heath will be dismantled
after it provoked a storm of criticism that refugees were being
held in inhumane conditions.
	   But with the government struggling to find accommodation for a
growing flood of refugees, the campers will be moved from one set
of tents to another. Soldiers were Friday setting up a new camp _
with better tents _ near the eastern city of Nijmegen.
	   Earlier this week, about 50 tents were pitched near Ermelo, a
town 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Amsterdam. The camp, which
housed about 80 people under army and police guard, was equipped
with portable toilets and a single water tank.
	   The move was a public relations disaster for the government as a
heavy storm on the first night exposed leaky tents and turned the
heath into muddy marshland.
	   The new camp near Nijmegen is expected to open Saturday and
provide shelter for up to 900 people.
	   Through September, 31,466 refugees have applied for permission
to stay in the Netherlands this year. That's 30 percent more than
the same period a year ago. By the end of the year, some officials
fear that number could swell to 50,000, creating a shortage of
space in Europe's most densely populated nation.
	   Dutch media also reported Friday that a Rwandan mother and her
two young children were dumped on the street by justice authorities
because they had no right to asylum in the Netherlands.
	   The family were the first victims of a tougher Dutch asylum
policy. Because the Hutus had come to the Netherlands by train from
Belgium, authorities now say they must apply for asylum there.

Survey shows most Israelis favor concessions at Wye summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ By a margin of nearly two to one, Israelis back
an American proposal for Israel to turn over another 13 percent of
the West Bank as part of an agreement with the Palestinians, an
Israeli newspaper reported Friday.
	   The Palestinians accepted the American proposal last March.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after initially
rejecting the proposal, eventually agreed, on condition that 3
percent of the area be set aside as a nature reserve in which
Israel retains full security control for the time being.
	   The newspaper Maariv published a Gallup poll that said 57
percent of Israelis favor handing over 13 percent, while 30 percent
are opposed.
	   The Israeli withdrawal is a key element in a series of interim
peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. The last one
was signed in January 1997. They call on Israel to hand over all of
the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control in three stages,
except for Jerusalem, Israeli settlements and designated military
locations. But none of the pullbacks has been implemented.
	   U.S. officials say the focus of the summit at Wye Plantation is
reaching agreement on the size of the withdrawal, while reassuring
Israel about security issues.
	   The poll also showed that 82 percent of Israelis hope the summit
meeting will end in agreement, but only 52 percent believe it will.
	   One thousand Israeli adults were questioned for the poll. The
paper said the margin of error is 3.2 percent.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leader of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarioan violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   They were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward
ending ``the national religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent

received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of

	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named

Investment talks to resume despite French no-show
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The world's club of industrialized nations will go
ahead with a new round of investment liberalization talks next week
despite France's pullout, the OECD said Friday.
	   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said
the meeting at its headquarters Tuesday will be to discuss
``possible approaches for future action'' toward hammering out the
Multilateral Agreement on Investment, or MAI.
	   Trade and finance ministers from the 29 OECD nations decided in
April to put the talks on hold for six months, in large part due to
French resistance to lowering certain barriers to investment.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin appeared to drive the
nail in the coffin on the talks strongly backed by the United
States, saying France would shun Tuesday's meeting.
	   Instead, he urged new negotiations instead at the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization, as Canada has also suggested.
	   Paris sees the MAI as threatening its artistic, cultural and
audiovisual industries, which many in France feel already suffer
from too much American influence.
	   The French, in turn, wanted Washington to move toward
eliminating laws that call for imposing sanctions on countries for
investing in Cuba, Iran and Libya.
	   ``We want that negotiations be able to resume on a totally new
basis and in the framework associating all actors, meaning all
countries, including the developing ones,'' the Socialist prime
minister told lawmakers during a question-and-answer session at the
National Assembly.

Hun Sen rejects opposition demands to hold talks outside Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday
rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country,
accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' the political
crisis.
	   Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom
Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party
to form a new government failed.
	   Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy,
citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two
alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely
in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence in
Beijing.
	   Hun Sen, however, rejected that.
	   ``I would like to make it clear that all meetings related to
Cambodian affairs must be conducted in the Kingdom of Cambodia,''
Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Friday.
	   ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. It is
detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122
parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds
majority needed to form a government on its own.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in
the elections was achieved through widespread fraud.
	   They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the
national assembly moving and a new government formed.
	   Hun Sen said on Friday that the opposition concerns over their
safety in the country was ``just an excuse for them to stay
abroad.''
	   Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have been outside the country
since parliament was ceremonially opened on Sep. 24.
	   Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have been under
court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom Penh
residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen was not home at the time of the
attack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators
contesting Hun Sen's election victory.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, in a statement released Friday, accused
Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to make any compromise'' on
negotiations to break the deadlock.
	   ``A meeting outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition,
could place all parties on more equal footing,'' said the
statement. ``But the ruling party refuses to negotiate unless it is
able to threaten its negotiating partners with arrest or worse.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Shocked by the mysterious murders of
at least 153 people accused of sorcery, Indonesia's justice
minister wants to outlaw black magic _ a practice in the Southeast
Asian nation since ancient times.
	   During recent months, parts of the main island of Java have been
terrorized by masked killers dressed in black, according to police,
witnesses and media reports.
	   They say the killers strike at night, cutting their victims
throats and sometimes hanging mutilated bodies in trees or tossing
them in the street. Mobs have also attacked and killed people they
accuse of dabbling in black magic.
	   Some of the dead were Muslim clerics. Others were farmers or
ordinary villagers.
	   In the latest attack in Jember, about 800 kilometers (500 miles)
east of Jakarta, an angry crowd repeatedly stabbed a man to death
after accusing him of being a sorcerer. They later threw his body
into the sea, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan reported.
	   Police have arrested more than 100 suspects in the kilings, but
acknowledge there's no clear motive for the grisly slayings.
	   The Jakarta Post newspaper Friday quoted Justice Minister Muladi
as saying fear of sorcery has stirred up unrest and violence in
superstitious communities.
	   ``The impact of this issue is very disturbing and it often
claims innocent victims,'' he said.
	   He said anyone who openly claims they can kill or hurt others
with black magic should be punished.
	   ``That would be one way to resolve the witchcraft issue,''
Muladi said.
	   In Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya, officers Wednesday
night fired warning shots above protesters when they stormed a
police station in the mistaken belief that three out-of-town
detectives inside were murder suspects.
	   Three protesters were hospitalized with gunshot wounds.
	   ``People become suspicious of just about anything nowadays,''
said North Surabaya police chief Lt. Col. Sunaryono.
	   The surge in violence has erupted as Indonesia grapples with
political turmoil and the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Violent protests killed about 1,200 people and helped drive
former authoritarian President Suharto from office in May. At that
time members of the mostly Christian or Buddhist ethnic Chinese
minority were targeted because of their relative wealth.
	   However, this new violence is now plaguing the Islamic majority.
Amid the social confusion of the economic crisis _ skyrocketing
inflation, unemployment, poverty and food shortages _ no one is
sure who is doing the killing or why.
	   Police speculate the slayings might be in revenge for the
slaughter of tens of thousands of communists in the mid-1960s when
Suharto took power after an abortive coup attempt. Historians say
Muslim clerics helped the army carry out the carnage.
	   Others believe the killings may represent a bloody power play
before general elections next year.
	   A third possibility is that some Muslim groups want to stamp out
mysticism that still permeates Indonesian society.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.

Tipping their hats to U.S. moves, Asian markets skyrocket

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The unexpected reduction in U.S. interest rates,
and the surge that followed on Wall Street, sent Asian stock
markets into a buying frenzy Friday that saw Singapore's bourse
skyrocket by 9.2 percent and Hong Kong's by nearly 9 percent.
	   But the dollar took another slide against the yen, which hurts
Asian exporters, and some analysts said it won't take long for
local concerns to override the benefits of America's moves.
	   ``External problems may be eased by the U.S. rate cut, but the
problems remain with Japan's domestic economy,'' said Kenji
Karikomi, a general manager at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
	   Across the board Thursday, the United States provided Asia's
rattled and depressed markets with one good sign after another.
	   For the second time in about two weeks, the U.S. Federal Reserve
cut interest rates by a quarter-point. The surprise reductions
ignited an explosive rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial
average ended the day up 330.58 points, or 4.2 percent, its
third-biggest point gain in history.
	   American economists also speculated that more rate cuts are
imminent as the central bank tries to keep global economic turmoil
from dragging the United States into a recession.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index hit the roof, rising 94.85
points, or 9.2 percent, to close at 1,119.6.
	   Analysts credited the reduction in U.S. interest rates for
lifting the index to its largest percentage gain, and its highest
closing level, since February.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 806.59 points,
or 8.9 percent, to close at 9,777.01 points, its highest level
since May 11.
	   Investors hoped that the territory's banks would once again
follow the U.S. lead and reduce interest rates, too. And it turned
out they were correct. Moments after the market closed, banks cut
the deposit rate, a key lending rate in Hong Kong.
	   The optimism on the index was clearest in property stocks, a
sector that led all others with a 13.5 percent increase.
	   The surge in volume indicated that cash-rich institutional
investors are returning to the market, said Howard Gorges, director
of South China Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.
	   In Tokyo, following three days of declines, the benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average of 225 issues gained 285.17 points, or 2.2 percent,
to close at 13,280.54.
	   However, the U.S. currency bought 116.44 yen in late afternoon
trading, down 2.29 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below
its late New York level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   Traders said the currency market in Japan is concerned that more
rate cuts are likely as the Fed attempts to prevent the U.S.
economy from slipping into a recession.
	   The dollar has fallen sharply against the yen for two weeks, and
that hurts exporters by making their products more expensive
overseas, and reduces the value of their repatriated earnings.
	   The success of key exporters such as Sony, Honda and Fujitsu has
provided Japan one of the few brights spots in its economy, which
is suffering its worst recession since World War II.
	   Despite the stock surge, traders said the outlook of Tokyo's
bourse remains weak. They said expected declines in corporate
earnings and skepticism about new efforts by the government to bail
out troubled banks have left investors pessimistic.
	   ``If anything, we expect the market to move downward in the
short term,'' said Jason James, a strategist at HSBC James Capel
Securities, in Tokyo.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with closing figures; ADDS cuts in local rates

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Friday, with
the key soaring nearly 9 percent in reaction to an unexpected cut
in U.S. interest rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 806.59 points, or 8.9
percent, closing at 9,777.01. On Thursday, the index had gained
131.41 points.
	   Turnver rose to 14.732 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.88
billion), up from Thursday's 5.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 756 million).
	   While traders had expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates
soon, they were surprised by its decision Thursday to cut two
interest rates by a quarter-percentage point without waiting for
the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee next month.
	   Rising hopes of smiliar rate cuts in Hong Kong pushed up the
banking and property sectors, which have both been hard hit by a
collapse in property prices, investor confidence, and an economic
slowdown in the territory.
	   After the market closed, the Hong Kong Association of Banks
announced a cut in deposit rates to 5.00 percent from 5.25 percent.
Leading banks also cut their prime lending rate 0.25 percent to
9.75 percent.
	   The surge in volume indicated that cash-rich institutional
investors were coming back to the market, said Howard Gorges,
director of South China Securities Ltd.
	   ``They probably find themselves sitting on a bit too much
cash,'' he said.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 7.00 Hong Kong
dollars to 44.90, and Cheung Kong rose 5.65 dollars to 52.25.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 13.00 dollars to
175.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 4.75 dollars to 63.75.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 7.10 dollars to 33.60, and
	   Hutchison Whampoa rose 5.40 dollars to 53.00.

John Hume says Nobel prize is endorsement of process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Adds more reaction from Hume &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Nobel-Peace &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ John Hume, joint winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize, said Friday that the honor represents ``very
powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern
Ireland.''
	   Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which
gets the largest share of votes from Northern Ireland's Roman
Catholic minority, worked tirelessly in pursuit of a cease-fire by
the Irish Republican Army and for all-party negotiations.
	   He shared the prize with David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, which gets the largest share of Protestant votes.
	   ``I think that today's announcement from the Nobel committee
strengthens our peace process enormously because it tells all the
people what the world want to see on our streets,'' Hume told a
news conference in Belfast.
	   He said the most powerful support for the process came from the
people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, who
overwhelmingly approved the peace agreement in a referendum in May.
	   ``The international community in its different ways has also
expressed its support, but today's annoucement from Norway by the
Nobel peace committee to David Trimble and myself is a very clear
and powerful statement of approval for the peace process and of the
international goodwill that exists for us.
	   ``And as I have said often to many of you recently, the
challenge to all of us now, as public representatives in Northern
Ireland from all parties, is to harness that international goodwill
for the benefit of all our people, particularly our young people,''
Hume said.
	   Hume addded that ``the work we have all been engaged in is to
lay the foundations for lasting peace and stability, and those
foundations are at the moment being laid as we put the agreement
into practice.
	   ``And as we lay those foundations and move towards a new
century, our hope is _ my hope is and my dream is _ that we're
moving to a completely new society, a new North, and a new Ireland,
in which both sections of our people will not only respect one
another, but will work together.
	   ``And once we hav a society in which all our energies are
devoted to building together and working together, rather than
quarreling, it will transform our society and in my opinion it will
become one of the most prominent regions in the whole of Europe.''

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leader of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarioan violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   They were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward
ending ``the national religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April also was the work of other Northern Ireland
political leaders, as well as the governments of the United
Kingdom, the United States and Ireland.
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on this week's
agreement to bring peace to Kosovo, Western and Yugoslav officials
on Friday signed a second pact in two days providing for
surveillance of the strife-torn province.
	   The head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe signed an accord allowing 2,000 unarmed
monitors to roam Kosovo _ making sure President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls out his troops as pledged.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
authorizing the ``verifiers'' with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanic.
	   He then headed straight to the southern Serbian province to try
to expedite setting up the mostly European force, which is expected
to take weeks to organize.
	   Spy planes are expected to start flying over Yugoslavia shortly
following the signing of an air surveillance accord late Thursday
by NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark,
and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The measures are designed to make sure Milosevic keeps his
promises to withdraw remaining Serb forces from Kosovo and help the
estimated 300,000 displaced ethnic Albanians return to their homes.
	   NATO this week set a Saturday deadline for the Yugoslav leader
to fully comply or face the renewed threat of airstrikes. But NATO
ambassadors were expected later Friday to extend that deadllly and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   Signifying that the military plan is still in place, the
outgoing Cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to
approve Friday sending 14 German jet fighters for any NATO attack.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush militant resistance in the
Serbian province, which is populated predominantly by ethnic
Albanians.
	   The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a six-truck aid convoy to Djakovica
near the Albanian border on Friday and were stepping up aid
efforts, spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. She said workers
had observed a continuing widespread fear of Serb forces,
preventing any full flow of refugees back to their charred homes.
	   Also Friday, the head of the first U.S. government team of aid
workers to go to Kosovo since the agreement was leaving for the
Serbian province. Roy Williams, disaster relief coordinator for the
U.S. Agency for International Development, said he expects the new
``unfettered access'' will speed distribution of aid.
	   He said there is enough food and other supplies to sustain the
scattered population during the winter if they can return to their
homes, but meeting medical needs will be a difficult challenge.

Sri Lanka declares new amnesty for army deserters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's defense ministry Friday
announced a 3-day amnesty for an estimated 20,000 army deserters,
nine days after it launched a campaign to arrest and re-enlist
them.
	   A defense ministry statement said the amnesty runs from Saturday
to Monday.
	   A large number of the soldiers deserted between May and October
when fighting with Tamil separatist rebels was prolonged and
vicious. Last month, as many as 1,800 combatants died in fighting
over a crucial highway in the country's north.
	   The army began the drive to bring back deserters last month and
has already arrested 2,889 deserters.
	   But the campaign is proving expensive and time consuming.
Police, helped by village officers and army clerks, are required to
nab deserters from their homes. But in some cases, they were found
to be moved away.
	   The military appears eager to bolster its strength for what it
sees as a crucial stage in the 15-year-old war against Tamil
rebels. Desertions from the 100,000-strong army are estimated at
20,000.
	   This is the second time this year that the defense ministry has
announced an amnesty. Nearly 14,000 deserters responded to the
government's amnesty offer in May. But 5,000 more deserted after
May.
	   Tamil rebels are fighting for a homeland in the country's north
and east, claiming that they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese who control the government and the military. The
government denies the charge.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed in the fighting.

	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on this week's
agreement to bring peace to Kosovo, Western and Yugoslav officials
on Friday signed a second pact in two days providing for
surveillance of the strife-torn province.
	   The head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe signed an accord allowing 2,000 unarmed
monitors to roam Kosovo _ making sure President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls out his troops as pledged.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
authorizing the ``verifiers'' with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanic.
	   He then headed straight to the southern Serbian province to try
to expedite setting up the mostly European force, which is expected
to take weeks to organize.
	   Spy planes are expected to start flying over Yugoslavia shortly
following the signing of an air surveillance accord late Thursday
by NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark,
and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The measures are designed to make sure Milosevic keeps his
promises to withdraw remaining Serb forces from Kosovo and help the
estimated 300,000 displaced ethnic Albanians return to their homes.
	   NATO this week set a Saturday deadline for the Yugoslav leader
to fully comply or face the renewed threat of airstrikes. But NATO
ambassadors were expected later Friday to extend that deadline _
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite the progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   Signifying that the military plan is still in place, the
outgoing Cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected to
approve Friday sending 14 German jet fighters for any NATO attack.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush militant resistance in the
Serbian province, which is populated predominantly by ethnic
Albanians.
	   The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a six-truck aid convoy to Djakovica
near the Albanian border on Friday and were stepping up aid
efforts, spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. She said workers
had observed a continuing widespread fear of Serb forces,
preventing any full flow of refugees back to their charred homes.
	   Also Friday, the head of the first U.S. government team of aid
workers to go to Kosovo since the agreement was leaving for the
Serbian province. Roy Williams, disaster relief coordinator for the
U.S. Agency for International Development, said he expects the new
``unfettered access'' will speed distribution of aid.
	   He said there is enough food and other supplies to sustain the
scattered population during the winter if they can return to their
homes, but meeting medical needs will be a difficult challenge.

Pakistani hackers turn Indian army website inside out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Hackers have turned an Indian army web
site inside out.
	   The web site, www.armyinkashmir.com, was designed to tally
alleged attacks by Kashmiri insurgents and cease-fire violations by
Pakistan, but was soon sabotaged apparently by a Pakistani hacker
on Tuesday.
	   The hacker rededicated the site to ``all the Kashmiri brothers
who are suffering the brutal oppression of the Indian army.''
	   The latest flare-up in the Indo-Pakistan propaganda war occurred
as negotiators for the two countries met for the first time in a
year in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. Negotiators resumed
talks on Kashmir, the Himalayan territory claimed by both countries
and divided between them for 50 years.
	   The Asian Age newspaper said the web site was overridden by an
unnamed information service in Lahore, Pakistan. The army quickly
moved its site to a new address, www.univall.com, and resumed
publishing its own version of events.

Uganda rebels split in dispute over abuse of civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels who have terrorized northern
Ugandans for 12 years split into two factions in a dispute over the
abuse of civilians, top security officials said.
	   Rebel leader Joseph Kony, who claims to be a spirit medium, has
led the fight in the north, purportedly to oust President Yoweri
Museveni. But it is his own people, the Acholi, who suffer his
vengeance.
	   The breakaway group, known as LRA-Democratic, and is led by
Ronald Otim Komakech, a military strategist, state-owned New Vision
newspaper reported Friday. Both groups are based and backed by
Sudan.
	   Komakech has attracted many junior rebel officers who disagree
with Kony's abuse of civilians, military sources told the
newspaper.
	   The LRA is not a serious threat to Museveni as its 3,000 rebels
strike only in the north, usually ineffectively. But the 900,000
people in the northern districts of Gulu and Kitgum live under
Kony's threat.
	   Kony is punishing the civilians because they stopped supporting
his bizarre crusade, which claims to fight for a government ruled
by the Ten Commandments while breaking them.
	   Rebels have chopped off the lips, noses, ears and genitals of
hundreds of suspected government informants. They've looted crops,
burned down homes and schools, and stolen hospital supplies. Tens
of thousands have died.
	   About 300,000 of them have fled their homes, sometimes under
military pressure, for poorly equipped villages patrolled by
soldiers.
	   Worst for the Acholi is having their own children abducted and
turned into enemies. UNICEF estimates 3,000 to 6,000 children have
been abducted. Others put the figure at 10,000.
	   Komakech has opened an office in Juba, southern Sudan, the New
Vision said, quoting unnamed military sources.
	   ``As soon as Komakech announced the formation of his group, Kony
is said to have claimed that some LRA ... fighters plan to kill
him. He is now avoiding stepping in Juba,'' a source was quoted as
saying.
	   Ugandan Army spokesman Capt. Shaban Bantariza said both factions
were being closely followed, adding, ``All groups that are nearing
their end often split.''
	   Ben Nyeko Pen-Mogi, a northern member of Parliament, said,
``They should split further. Their demise is the pleasure of the
Acholis.''
	   Komakech, who is believed to be a northerner, formerly fought
with the Uganda National Liberation Army, which was defeated by
Museveni in 1986.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ President Roman Herzog will receive an
honorary doctoral degree from Ben Gurion University on Nov. 16, his
office announced Friday.
	   Herzog also plans to met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
the next day, before making a two-day state visit to neighboring
Jordan.
	   Herzog's five-year term expires in May, and he has indicated he
will not run for re-election by parliament. Nominally above

	   ---_
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel
Peace Prize for 1998 to John Hume and David Trimble for their
efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Northern
Ireland.
	   Over the past thirty years, the national, religious and social
conflict in Northern Ireland has cost over 3,500 people their
lives. John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most
consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for
a peaceful solution. The foundations of the peace agreement signed
on Good Friday 1998 reflect principles which he has stood for.
	   As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in Northern
Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage when, at a
critical stage of the process, he advocated solutions which led to
the peace agreement. As the head of the Northern Ireland
government, he has taken the first steps towards building up the
mutual confidence on which a lasting peace must be based.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee also wishes to emphasise the
importance of the positive contributions to the peace process made
by other Northern Irish leaders, and by the governments of Great
Britain, Ireland, and the United States.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee expresses the hope that the
foundations which have now been laid will not only lead to lasting
peace in Northern Ireland, but also serve to inspire peaceful
solutions to other religious, ethnic and national conflicts around
the world.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The opposition-dominated upper house of Japan's
Parliament passed a no-confidence motion Friday against the head of
the Defense Agency for a scandal involving overcharging the
government for military equipment.
	   The resolution, which urged agency chief Fukushiro Nukaga to
take responsibility for the scandal, has no binding power. But it
underscored the growing weakness of Japan's ruling party.
	   It was the first time in the five-decade history of Parliament
that a no-confidence vote had passed the upper house, which has
been controlled by opposition parties since 1989.
	   The measure passed the 252-seat chamber 140-103.
	   Defense agency officials are accused of allowing the overpayment
for defense equipment by suppliers in exchange for securing jobs
for retiring agency bureaucrats. Two senior agency officials have
been arrested.
	   Further undermining the agency's credibility are allegations
against other agency officials of hiding or burning documents to
cover up evidence.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who met with Nukaga after the
resolution's passage, said Nukaga should stay on to deal with the
scandal and regain public trust.
	   ``He recognizes the resolution is a serious matter,'' Obuchi
told reporters. ``But to work toward a new Defense Agency is his
mission.''
	   Nukaga, who is not personally implicated in the scandal, also
said he had no plans to step down.
	   ``It's my obligation for the time being to inquire into facts
and implement strict measures,'' he was quoted as saying by Kyodo
News service.
	   The less powerful upper house is dominated by the opposition,
including the Democratic Party, the Komei party and the Liberal
Party, which submitted the resolution. Two other opposition groups,
the Communists and the Social Democrats, also backed the
resolution.
	   The ruling Liberal Democrats control the majority in the lower
house.

Internet petition drive to free Ron Arad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A group working for the release of Israeli
airman Ron Arad, missing for 12 years, is collecting electronic
signatures this weekend and hopes to deliver at least one million
to Iranian President Mohammed Khatami.
	   Arad was shot down during an October 1986 bombing mission over
south Lebanon. The navigator's whereabouts are unknown, but Israel
believes he is held either by Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim
guerrillas in Lebanon or in Iran.
	   Arad's brother, Chen, said Friday that the Israeli government
has not done enough to find the captive.
	   ``The bottom line is that my brother is not here. It proves that
somebody, someone is making a mistake and can't provide us with a
solution,'' Arad said Friday. ``They just look at the sky and say,
`What can we do?'''
	   The Fellowship for Ron Arad's Release is marking the 12th
anniversary of the navigator's capture with an Internet petition
drive.
	   On Friday and Saturday, the search engines Yahoo and Lycos and
their Israeli counterparts will have links to the petition.
Couriers will attempt to deliver printouts of the petition to
Khatami's residence in Tehran.
	   Pressure from diplomats has been unsuccessful in gaining Arad's
release, said Yosef Harari, chairman of the group. Harari said that
an appeal by ordinary people might be more effective.
	   ``I'm not the president or the prime minister or the chief of
staff,'' Harari said. ``If a million people like me try their best
to sign the letter, we hope something will happen.''

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the Catholic Social Democratic and Labor
Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist
party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for work toward
ending ``the national religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April also was the work of other Northern Ireland
political leaders, as well as the governments of the United
Kingdom, the United States and Ireland.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that any award promoting peace in Northern Ireland
would also include Gerry Adams, leader of Sein Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army.
	   At his news conference, Sejersted was asked if the committee had
shunned Adams because of the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to
discuss the deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in
found the International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   ``We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did,''
said Sejersted. But he said that just illustrated what a long and
complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Russian defense minister says peace accord for Kosovo will stand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister on Friday predicted a
peace deal between the West and Yugoslavia will hold out thanks to
Russia's mediation.
	   ``We fully control the situation (in Kosovo), follow its
development and hope it will be settled by peaceful means,''
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said, according to the Interfax news
agency. ``The peace process has become irreversible.''
	   Sergeyev spoke after a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart
Alexander Chumakov to discuss the situation in Yugoslavia and their
shared opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
	   He said they worked out ``concrete steps'' to counter NATO's
move to incorporate former Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, but
refused to elaborate.
	   Chumakov said that the Belarusian military would be the `Bed NATO's expansion eastward
and spoke out against NATO's proposed airstrikes on Serbia, which
shares common Slavic roots and Orthodox Christian religion.
	   Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has promised to help
Serbia with weapons if NATO proceeds with airstrikes. Russia's
Defense Ministry issued a similar warning last week.
	   Sergeyev said he didn't discuss such aid at the meeting with the
Belarusian military on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Communists and other hardliners dominating the
Russian parliament's lower house, the State Duma, proposed that
Russia hold naval exercises ``near Yugoslavia's Adriatic coast and
the U.S. Sixth Fleet.''
	   While reflecting hard-line sentiment, the proposal has no
practical meaning because the Russian parliament has no say over
the government's foreign policy.

Quarter of Korean bank loans classified as ``problematic''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's troubled banks are
weighed down by 150 trillion won (dlrs 111 billion) ``problematic''
debt _ nearly 25 percent of their total outstanding loans, the
government said Friday.
	   The Financial Supervisory Commission figure, which estimated
debt to the end of June, is almost twice the government's budget
for next year, set at 85.79 trillion won (64.9 billion).
	   ``The June figures are the latest and can stand for now,'' said
Koo Bon-kyong, a commission spokesman.
	   The commission said about half of the 150 trillion won (dlrs 111
billion) in loans are non-performing _ meaning principal and
interest payments have not been made for more than three months.
	   The other half was termed ``precautionary,'' meaning payments
have not been made for between one and three months.
	   The staggering estimate came a few days after the U.S. credit
ratings agency, Moody's Investors Service, said South Korea's banks
are under towering mounds of bad loans and are technically
insolvent.
	   Moody's warned that heavily indebted Korean banks could see a
further drop in its credit ratings unless the problem is eased
urgently.
	   Dozens of large-scale South Korean companies have collapsed in
recent years, leaving the country's financial system saddled with
huge amounts of bad loans.
	   That fueled a flight of foreign capital, forcing South Korea to
turn to the International Monetary Fund to bail out its economy in
December.

Burundi denies involvement in Congolese war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Burundi's government on Friday denied an
accusation that it is helping rebels trying to topple Congolese
President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``We have said, and say again, that Burundi is not involved in
the Congolese conflict,'' the state-run Burundi Press Agency said,
quoting a government communique.
	   Burundi acknowledged it has security and economic interests in
neighboring Congo and urged the international community ``to
contribute towards bringing about a quick and peaceful solution''
to the conflict, said the report monitored in Kenya.
	   Mwenze Kongolo, Congo's justice minister, last week accused
Burundi's Tutsi-dominated government of siding with the rebels in
their two-month rebellion.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been reinforced with troops
and weapons from neighboring Rwanda, which has a Tutsi-dominated
government, as well as from Uganda.
	   The Burundian government also denied Kongolo's charge that
Burundian Tutsis are settling in eastern Congo.
	   ``As for the movement of Burundians to the Democratic Republic
of Congo with the purpose of creating a Tutsiland, the truth is
that there has never been such a movement of people,'' the news
agency said.
	   On Wednesday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda's
Vice President Paul Kagame, called on their former protege, Kabila,
to open talks with rebels who now control one fourth of the vast
central African nation.
	   Uganda and Rwanda backed Kabila in his war that ousted the late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year.
	   In a statement, Museveni and Kagame, who is also Rwanda's
defense minister, ``stressed that the resolution of the conflict
must address in an acceptable and sustainable way the legitimate
interests of all Congo's neighboring states.''
	   Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad are militarily backing Kabila
in the current fighting.

Benetton, Turkish licensee sign memorandum on child-labor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ In a move to repair its tarnished image,
Benetton clothing has signed a memorandum for a child-free labor
policy with its Turkish licensee accused of hiring children ages 9
to 13.
	   The memorandum, signed Thursday, came a day after the Turkish
contractor Bogazici Ready Wear announced that it had suspended all
acquisitions from manufacturers that could not prove a child-free
labor policy.
	   The memorandum is a written pledge to abide by labor laws, which
says ``children under the age of 15 cannot be employed in any
condition.''
	   A textile worker's group claims that a Bogazici Ready Wear
contractor in Istanbul employed children ages 9 to 13 and paid them
less than dlrs 90 a month to make clothing for the Italian-based
Benetton.
	   An estimated one-third of Turkey's children between 6 and 14
years old work, according to the United Nations. Most work in
domestic labor, many in small industries, and thousands work in the
streets.

West, Yugoslavs sign second surveillance accord on Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on the agreement to
bring peace to Kosovo, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a
second pact Friday in two days providing for surveillance of the
strife-torn province.
	   The head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe signed an accord allowing 2,000 unarmed
monitors to roam Kosovo _ making sure President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls out his troops as pledged.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
authorizing the ``verifiers'' with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanic.
	   He then headed straight to the southern Serbian province to try
to expedite setting up the mostly European force, which is expected
to take weeks to organize.
	   Spy planes are expected to start flying over Yugoslavia shortly
following the signing of an air surveillance accord late Thursday
by NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark,
and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The measures are designed to make sure Milosevic keeps his
promises to withdraw remaining Serb forces from Kosovo and help the
estimated 300,000 displaced ethnic Albanians return to their homes.
	   NATO this week set a Saturday deadline for the Yugoslav leader
to fully comply or face the renewed threat of airstrikes. But NATO
ambassadors were expected later Friday to extend that deadline _
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite the progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   The focus for now is on getting the huge monitoring mission
going, giving Milosevic more time to demonstrate compliance.
	   ``Its first task is to stop bloodshed and avoid humanitarian
disaster,'' Geremek told reporters. ``And the second to create
conditions for dialogue between the Kosovo Albanian community and
the federal government.''
	   But signifying that NATO's airstrikes plan is still in place,
the outgoing cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was expected
to approve Friday sending 14 German jet fighters for any attack.

 &UR; Deal done, Taiwan negotiator flies to Beijing

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Armed with an agreement to work toward resuming
talks, Taiwan's top China negotiator on Friday declared a ``renewed
beginning'' in ties between the two rivals following a three-year
lull.
	   Arriving in Beijing from talks in the commercial capital of
Shanghai, Koo Chen-fu said lack of trust remained one of the most
important problems between Taiwan and China.
	   He also noted that the two sides have not signed a peace treaty
since the Chinese civil war divided them 49 years ago.
	   But Koo also was upbeat, welcoming the deal he and his Chinese
counterpart, Wang Daohan, struck Thursday in Shanghai to work
toward repairing negotiations broken off by China three years ago.
	   At a news conference, Koo said his two days of talks with Wang
had allowed them to make their positions clear. He said he was
``very happy about a renewed beginning of relations.''
	   ``Slowly, step-by-step, everything can discussed,'' he said.
	   China and Taiwan have rarely compromised since Mao Tse-tung's
Communists vanquished Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists on the
mainland in 1949.
	   After Taiwan's Lee made the first-ever visit by a Taiwanese
president to the United States in 1995, Beijing scrubbed a 2-year
dialogue and launched intimidating war games near the island.
Relations plunged to their lowest level since the height of the
Cold War.
	   Koo, making his first visit to Beijing since the 1949 Communist
takeover, will spend two days in the Chinese capital, sightseeing
and banqueting before scheduled meetings Sundays with President
Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen.
	   Koo declined at the news conference to say what he expected to
discuss with Jiang. The meeting is thought unlikely to yield more
agreements, although it is expected to highlight the warmer
atmosphere between the two.
	   Before flying to Beijing, Koo visited a 400-year-old park in
Shanghai and composed a poem there that also seemed intended to
highlight the brighter prospects after years of divisiveness.
	   ``When people feel spring is coming, they tend to forget the
long waiting in the winter,'' Koo said reciting the poem for
reporters.
	   Under the four-point deal reached Thursday, members of the two
government-backed bodies that Wang and Koo head will hold
discussions on all matters. Wang's chief aide, Tang Shubei, said
the talks would cover political matters, a euphemism for
reunification _ a subject Beijing has long sought to put on the
agenda.
	   Koo also invited Wang to visit Taiwan, and Wang agreed.
	   In Taiwan, initial reaction was muted to Thursday's agreement _
which was essentially to talk about more formal talks. Newspapers
and observers said major differences remained.
	   The Liberty Times said Beijing was still sticking rigidly to its
view that Taiwan is a province of China.
	   Local and international politics played a hand in coaxing China
and Taiwan to move ahead. The Nationalists hope improved ties with
China will win them business community support in upcoming
elections. Chinese President Jiang faces pressure from the powerful
Chinese military and communist old guard to get Taiwan to agree to
reunification.

Asian markets jump following U.S. rate cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with closing figures; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets soared Friday as the
surprise cut in U.S. interest rates allayed fears of a global
recession, luring foreign investors back into the region's battered
bourses.
	   But analysts discounted the rallies as a knee-jerk reaction,
saying the extent of the world's financial problems has yet to
unfold.
	   ``Asia is mired in a crisis with massive debts overhanging and
enormous deflation pressure,'' said Andrew Fernow, research
director for Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd. ``To suggest that the
problem can be dealt with overnight or with a few rate cuts in the
U.S. is just absurd.''
	   Despite warnings of looming problems, foreign fund managers
continued to pour money back into Asia.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted
its first gain in four trading days, advancing 285.17 points, or
2.19 percent, to close at 13,280.54. On Thursday, the Nikkei had
fallen 0.58 percent.
	   Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index soared 806.59 points, or
8.9 percent, closing at 9,777.01, the highest level since May 11.
The index had gained 1.5 percent Thursday.
	   Hopes that Hong Kong banks would follow the U.S. Federal
Reserve's decision Thursday to reduce interest rate by a quarter
point spurred buying in property shares. An index measuring the
value of big Hong Kong real estate companies rose by 14.5 percent.
	   The Hong Kong Association of Banks announced after trading
closed that it decided to cut the deposit rate, a key lending rate,
by a quarter point to 5.0 percent. Several big commercial banks
immediately responded by cutting their their prime lending rates.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index also leapt 94.85 points,
or 9.3 percent, to 1,024.75, the largest gain since February.
	   Indonesia's JSX index skyrocketed 10.7 percent to 337.587 on the
back of a firmer local currency, the rupiah.
	   Thailand's SET index jumped 8.1 percent to 319.22; the
Philippines' PSE index surged 7 percent to close at 1,437.36; and
South Korea's Kospi rose 1.4 percent to 374.01.
	   Australia's All Ordinaries Index gained 2.1 percent to 2,511.4
on hopes of domestic interest rate cuts; and New Zealand's NZSE-40
Capital Index grew 1.6 percent to 1,793.83.
	   In Malaysia, shares opened sharply higher, but some investors
soon sold stocks they didn't want to hold over a three-day weekend
and prices gave up their early gains. The benchmark Composite index
closed just 0.77 percent higher at 396.26.
	   In Japan, traders cautioned that the gains may prove short-lived
because of lingering worry about the country's shaky banking system
_ and whether recently passed legislation will be sufficient to
stabilize it.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen. The
dollar bought 116.44 yen in late afternoon trading, down 2.29 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   The Fed surprised markets with its first emergency interest-rate
cuts in more than four years, acknowledging tacitly that its
quarter-point rate cut last month wasn't sufficient to defuse a
looming U.S. credit crunch.
	   The move triggered a rally on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average closed up 4.1 percent at 8,299.
	   Fernow, the research director at Vickers, said the rate cut has
raised an alarm, ignored Friday by investors.
	   ``This suggests a rather desperate attempt to address what could
be a very devastating problem,'' he said.
	   ``We don't know the full extent of the breakdown of the
financial system due to the exposure some financial institutions
have, not only to the emerging markets, but also hedge fund trading
that have kept very secret,'' he said.

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reax from British, Irish Prime Ministers, comment
from committee chairman on risk of setbacks.
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for
work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April was the work of other Northern Ireland political
leaders, as well as the governments of the United Kingdom, the
United States and Ireland.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also
include Gerry Adams, leader of Sein Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
	   At his news conference, Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis
Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of
the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to discuss the
deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in
founding the International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   ``We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did,''
said Sejersted. But he said that just illustrated what a long and
complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been.
	   Sejersted said the committee knows that there is a risk of
setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords
were signed in April.
	   But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right
track, and that there is reason for optimist,'' the chairman said.
``We wanted to give it a push.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern, both mentioned a possible winners of this year's
peace prize, immediately praised the decision.
	   ``There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
than David Trimble and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is
a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership.''
	   Ahern called it ``a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects'' of the peace agreement.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Malaysian authorities raid money changers hoarding dollars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank raided 10
illegal money changers in an effort to wipe out a nascent black
market for dollars, the bank's officials said Friday.
	   Bank Negara Malaysia said six foreign exchange dealers along the
back streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur were raided on Wednesday,
together with four others in the surrounding state of Selangor.
	   ``Various foreign currencies and relevant documents were
seized,'' the bank said in a statement.
	   The illicit dealers are under investigation, and could be jailed
for up to five years and fined 100,000 ringgit (dlrs 26,300).
	   A black market for foreign currency has been emerging after
Malaysia introduced capital controls in September, a move that
effectively pegged the ringgit currency at 3.80 against the U.S.
dollar.
	   Prior to the capital curbs, the ringgit was considerably weaker,
hovering around 4.20 against the dollar.
	   With the new foreign exchange peg, the government was able to
prevent the ringgit trading overseas and force people to bring in
their money into Malaysia to help boost the badly sagging economy.
	   The government said a fixed exchange rate would provide
stability and insulate the currency against attacks by speculators.
	   Because many of the 1,095 licensed foreign exchange dealers feel
the rate is too low, they are hoarding dollars. Some illegal ones
prefer to sell it in the black market for a higher price.

	   HONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong's leading banks announced Friday they
were cutting their prime lending rate by 0.25 percentage point to
9.75 percent.
	   Interest rates on savings and all deposits also were reduced by

	   The move followed unexpected cuts in U.S. interest rates on
Thursday, which sent Hong Kong share prices soaring on Friday.

Federal Reserve to again lower interest rates before cutting Hong

One of Africa's Last Monarchies Holds Elections for Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBANE, Swaziland (AP) - Swazis lined up at the polls Friday to
practice their peculiar form of democracy, voting for Parliament in
a country where parties are banned and the king can rule by decree.
	   Opposition groups pressing for greater democracy had called for
a boycott of the country's second election in 25 years. But rain
and fog probably discouraged many voters, making it difficult to
tell whether the boycott calls were successful.
	   Voters in this kingdom of 1 million people bordered by South
Africa and Mozambique chose 55 representatives in the House of
Assembly. The Legislature acts mainly as a rubber stamp for the
Cabinet appointed by King Mswati III. Mswati was out of the country
on a visit to the Far East.
	   The vote, however, was closely watched in a part of Africa where
democracy received a major boost with South Africa's first free
elections in 1994.
	   At the same time leaders of nearby countries like Namibia and
Zimbabwe are showing increasing autocratic tendencies.
	   Earlier this week, police raided the homes of three opposition
leaders. Police stopped cars at roadblocks Friday outside the
capital and patrolled the main downtown street.
	   Most shops were closed after the government ordered a national
day off so people could vote.
	   Elections officials have said about 200,000 people were
registered to vote, a bit less than half of those eligible.

China's economy shows slight improvement in 3rd quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Massive government spending is paying off,
slightly boosting China's economic growth to 7.6 percent in the
third quarter, official statistics released Friday said.
	   The boost increased China's gross domestic product during the
first nine months of the year by 7.2 percent, a shade better than
the 7 percent pace set in the first half.
	   The State Statistical Bureau said the economy produced 5.44
trillion yuan (dlrs 658.6 billion) worth of goods and services
during the first nine months of the year.
	   As the government turned on the taps, fixed-asset investment
surged 33.8 percent in September. For the first three quarters, the
figure jumped 20 percent to 1.086 trillion yuan (dlrs 131.5
billion), the bureau said.
	   Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen forecast that fourth quarter economic
growth would be higher, helping the government to reach its target
of 8 percent GDP growth for 1998.
	   ``The growth target can be achieved,'' Ye said in a statement.
	   China's top leaders have put a premium on keeping the growth
rate high as state enterprises and banks struggle through
market-oriented reforms.
	   The restructuring of China's state sector is expected to result
in millions of job losses and Beijing wants a strong economy to be
able to absorb the unemployed.
	   Profits of state companies slumped 36 percent in the first three
quarters, compared with a 43 percent drop in the first half.
	   The domestic spending program _ expected to reach dlrs 1.2
trillion over three years _ is also aimed at cushioning the economy
from declining export growth and sluggish foreign investment due to
the Asia financial crisis.
	   For the first nine months, China's exports rose 3.9 percent on
year to dlrs 134.13 billion while foreign direct investment
amounted to dlrs 31.4 billion, unchanged from the same period in
1997.
	   China is also struggling to revive consumer demand to help pare
down bloated stockpiles at state factories. Retail sales rose by a
moderate 6.3 percent in the first three quarters from the same
period in 1997, the bureau reported.

Arafat to visit King Hussein in hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will visit
Jordan's King Hussein at the Mayo Clinic on Friday, officials said.
	   A government official said Arafat will fly to the clinic in
Rochester, Minn. from Wye Plantation, a resort outside Washington
where he is holding peace talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, did
not give details.
	   Omar Khatib, Arafat's representative in Jordan, said the meeting
is scheduled for Friday evening. He declined to specify the hour.
	   He said Arafat was originally scheduled to see Hussein on
Wednesday but the meeting was deferred because the Palestinian
leader arrived in the United States ``at a very late hour.''
	   Hussein, who is suffering from lymphatic cancer, was admitted to
the clinic in July. His chemotherapy was expected to conclude by
the end of October or mid-November.

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with efforts to reach Trimble in 13th graf, reax from
British, Irish Prime Ministers in 18th-20th grags, comment from
committee chairman on risk of setbacks in 17th graf. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, won the Nobel Peace
Prize Friday for their efforts to end the sectarian violence that
plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for
work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April was the work of other Northern Ireland political
leaders, as well as the governments of the United Kingdom, the
United States and Ireland.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also
include Gerry Adams, leader of Sein Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
	   At his news conference, Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis
Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of
the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to discuss the
deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   In Denver early Friday, where Trimble was visiting as part of an
11-city North American tour aimed at promoting investment in the
British province, aides refused to wake him for comment, saying he
would make a statement later in the day.
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in
founding the International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   ``We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did,''
said Sejersted. But he said that just illustrated what a long and
complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been.
	   Sejersted said the committee knows that there is a risk of
setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords
were signed in April.
	   But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right
track, and that there is reason for optimist,'' the chairman said.
``We wanted to give it a push.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern, both mentioned a possible winners of this year's
peace prize, immediately praised the decision.
	   ``There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
than David Trimble and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is
a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership.''
	   Ahern called it ``a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects'' of the peace agreement.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following up on the agreement to
bring peace to Kosovo, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a
second pact Friday providing for surveillance of the strife-torn
province.
	   The head of the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe signed an accord allowing 2,000 unarmed
monitors to roam Kosovo _ making sure President Slobodan Milosevic
pulls out his troops as pledged.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
authorizing the ``verifiers'' with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanic.
	   He then headed straight to the southern Serbian province to try
to expedite setting up the mostly European force, which is expected
to take weeks to organize.
	   Spy planes haver permission to start flying over Yugoslavia
after an air surveillance accord was signed late Thursday by NATO's
supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The measures are designed to make sure Milosevic keeps his
promises to withdraw remaining Serb forces from Kosovo and help the
estimated 300,000 displaced ethnic Albanians return to their homes.
	   NATO this week set a Saturday deadline for the Yugoslav leader
to fully comply or face the renewed threat of airstrikes. But NATO
ambassadors were expected later Friday to extend that deadline _
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite the progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   The focus for now is on getting the huge monitoring mission
going, giving Milosevic more time to demonstrate compliance.
	   ``Its first task is to stop bloodshed and avoid humanitarian
disaster,'' Geremek told reporters. ``And the second to create
conditions for dialogue between the Kosovo Albanian community and
the federal government.''
	   But signifying that NATO's plan for airstrikes is still in
place, the outgoing cabinet of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was
expected to approve Friday sending 14 German jet fighters for any
attack.

China to order officials to give up their cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese officials may be forced to give up their
cars under a cost-saving plan proposed to the State Council, or
cabinet, the newspaper China Business Times reported Friday.
	   Citing public anger over government waste and the high costs of
maintenance, the Office for Economic Restructuring proposed
transportation subsidies in lieu of cars for Chinese officials, the
report said.
	   ``Vehicle reform,'' as the plan is known, would offer monthly
allowances ranging from 100 yuan (dlrs 12) for lower-ranking
officials to 3,000 yuan (dlrs 363) for minister-level officials.
Top leaders would have the option of keeping their cars, according
to the newspaper.
	   If the plan is approved by the State Council, officials will
start giving back their cars on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The report noted that official preferences run toward luxury
models, causing an additional strain on government funds. Under the
plan, officials could no longer drive public cars for private use
and ``must find their own way to work,'' the newspaper said.

Japan's Foreign Minister to work on World War II peace treaty with
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two grafs at end with lawmaker saying current
parliament would not approve a treaty on Kurils. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will
spend the weekend working toward a World War II peace treaty with
Russia, which the two countries have never signed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be
signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over the
Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the
disagreement on the Kuril Islands despite the overall improvement
in relations.
	   In an interview published Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese
relations have made progress because of summits between Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin and Japan's former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura, who was to arrive in Moscow on Friday night, is expected
to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and other top officials, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The visit comes one day after Russia's parliament voted to
reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in World War II.
The holiday had been dropped after the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, agreed
to reestablish the Day of Victory Over Militarist Japan, which
marks the Soviet Union's defeat of Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The measure, which has already been approved by the lower house,
requires President Boris Yeltsin's signature to become law.
	   A liberal Russian lawmaker, meanwhile, said Thursday it would be
``impossible'' to pass an agreement on the Kurils through the
current parliament.
	   ``Therefore this subject should not be brought into Russia's
internal political debate before the next parliamentary election,''
said Vladimir Averchev, a member of the Yabloko party and the State
Duma's international affairs committee, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.

Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for
work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement signed this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
signed in April was the work of other Northern Ireland political
leaders, as well as the governments of the United Kingdom, the
United States and Ireland.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also
include Gerry Adams, leader of Sein Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
	   At his news conference, Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis
Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of
the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to discuss the
deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   In Denver early Friday, where Trimble was visiting as part of an
11-city North American tour aimed at promoting investment in the
British province, aides refused to wake him for comment, saying he
would make a statement later in the day.
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in
founding the International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   ``We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did,''
said Sejersted. But he said that just illustrated what a long and
complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been.
	   Sejersted said the committee knows that there is a risk of
setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords
were signed in April.
	   But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right
track, and that there is reason for optimist,'' the chairman said.
``We wanted to give it a push.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern, both mentioned a possible winners of this year's
peace prize, immediately praised the decision.
	   ``There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
than David Trimble and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is
a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership.''
	   Ahern called it ``a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects'' of the peace agreement.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Myanmar gem sale to feature dlrs 13 million of goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nearly dlrs 13 million worth of jade,
gemstones and jewelry will go on sale to foreign merchants at the
government's annual mid-year gem emporium next week, the deputy
mines minister announced Friday.
	   Gem emporiums have been held annually since 1964, with midyear
sales instituted just a few years ago, when the government
liberalized the economy and allowed private dealers to participate.
	   More than 200 gem merchants from 14 countries are expected to
attend this mid-year emporium which will take place from Oct. 17 to
22, Deputy Minister Myint Thein said.
	   He said that dlrs 7.5 million worth of gems, jade and pearls
will be up for auction, while dlrs 3.8 million worth of gems, jade
and jewelry will be sold by tender and dlrs 1.4 million worth of
gems, jewelry and jade carving will be sold at fixed prices.
	   Due to the economic crisis in the region, the floor price of the
goods has been reduced to attract buyers, minister said.

Saudi beheaded for children's rape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of raping a
number of children was beheaded Friday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Fahd Saud al-Amri abducted several boys and girls in separate
incidents and raped them in isolated areas outside Riyadh, the
official Riyadh radio quoted a ministry statement as saying.
	   It said al-Amri would leave his victims at the sites and return
to the city. It did not say when the crimes took place or how many
children were assaulted. Police spokesmen were not immediately
available for comment due to the Muslim sabbath.
	   Al-Amri, who is married and has children, is a repeat offender
who had been lashed and jailed for similar crimes in the past, the
radio said.
	   His execution, in Riyadh, raised to 22 the number of beheadings
in the kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The unexpected reduction in U.S. interest rates,
and the surge that followed on Wall Street, sent Asian stock
markets into a buying frenzy Friday that saw Singapore's bourse
skyrocket by 9.2 percent and Hong Kong's by nearly 9 percent. But
the dollar took another slide against the yen, which hurts Asian
exporters, and some analysts said it won't take long for local
concerns to override the benefits of America's moves. In Singapore,
the Straits Times Index hit the roof, rising 94.85 points, or 9.2
percent, to close at 1,119.6, its highest closing level since
February. In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 806.59
points, or 8.9 percent, to close at 9,777.01 points, its highest
level since May. Moments after the Hong Kong market closed, banks
cut the deposit rate, a key lending rate. In Tokyo, following three
days of declines, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues
gained 285.17 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 13,280.54.
However, the U.S. currency bought 116.44 yen in late afternoon
trading, down 2.29 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Pushing to finish talks on forming a new
center-left government, Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
revisit the divisive issue of energy taxes Friday. Party leaders,
who had hoped to wrap up the negotiations this weekend, said late
Thursday they would stretch till at least Monday. On Thursday the
two sides said that they had agreed to pass a law within the first
100 days in office to abandon nuclear energy, a move strongly
pushed by the environmentalist Greens, who wanted immediate closure
of some plants. But in what party leaders called a compromise, the
future governing partners agreed to start talks with the nuclear
industry next year on the fate of Germany's 19 atomic power plants.
One-third of Germany's electricity is produced by nuclear energy.
Power companies argue shutting them prematurely would result in
higher prices and force them to rely more on burning oil and coal,
creating more pollution. (GERMANY-POLITICS)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Some 1.5 billion people in developing
nations earn less than the equivalent of a dollar a day, due partly
to stingier aid-giving by rich countries and to feeble efforts by
their own governments to fight poverty, according to a U.N. report
to be released Friday. In South Asia, half of all children under
five are malnourished, and almost two-thirds of all South Asian
women can't read or write. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a third of the
population is unlikely to live past the age of 40, according to the
U.N. Development Program report. Despite glimmers of progress _
more poor countries are forming plans to combat extreme poverty _
the global financial crisis has heightened the need for more
effective measures to help the world's poor, the study said. Aid
from donor countries is at an all-time low, with contributions at
less than 0.2 percent of donors' combined gross national products.
None of the wealthy Group of Seven nations _ the United States,
Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada _ has contributed
aid at the level suggested by the United Nations _ 0.7 percent of
GNP. (UN-POVERTY REPORT)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's Parliament passed a
revised law on Friday to revitalize the ailing banking sector and
to let foreign investors own 100 percent of a local bank. The new
law is regarded as crucial to efforts to restructure Indonesia's
banking industry, crippled by the worst economic crisis in 30
years. The new law stipulates that foreign ownership of Indonesian
banks will be dealt with only by government regulations. The
previous 1992 banking law specifically barred foreigners from
owning any more than 49 percent of stock in an Indonesian bank.
Dozens of insolvent banks have been shut down, merged, nationalized
or placed under government supervision after they collapsed
following a dramatic dive in the value of the rupiah against the
U.S. dollar in July 1997. Indonesia's economy was worst hit by
Asia's financial meltdown and its banks were left in a mess.
(INDONESIA-BANK LAW)
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ With soon-to-come economic austerity
measures expected to spell recession and more unemployment,
retailers in South America's biggest city are bracing for the worst
Christmas season in years. During the last two months of the year,
sales were expected to drop by almost 10 percent compared to the
same period in 1997. ``It is almost certain that higher taxes will
be part of the fiscal austerity measures to be announced,'' said
Elvio Aliprandi, president of the Sao Paulo Chamber of Commerce.
``This means less money in the consumer's pocket.'' Brazil has been
a major casualty of the global economic crisis, marked by loss of
investor confidence and strong outflow of capital. The country's
foreign reserves have fallen below dlrs 50 billion from dlrs 70
billion at the end of July. (BRAZIL-ECONOMY)

Ukrainian ship sinks in North Sea: 3 dead, 3 missing, 5 rescued
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Three crew members of a Ukrainian
ship died and three others were missing Friday after the cargo
vessel sank in the North Sea.
	   The other five crew members were rescued by helicopter and boat,
the Navy Operational Command reported.
	   The accident happened about 4 a.m. (0200 GMT) three miles (5
kms) off Denmark's west coast. The navy received an emergency call
from the cargo ship ``Aster'' stating the hull was leaking. Rescue
helicopters arrived at the scene within an hour, but the ship
already had sunk.
	   The 11 crew members were Ukrainians and Russians.
	   Weather conditions were normal, navy command's officer of the
watch, Anders Moeller, said in a telephone interview. Water was
calm and winds were strong but not hazardous.
	   The ``Aster'' was carrying phosphates, he said.
	   The search for the missing crew members continued Friday. ``We
have not lost hope yet,'' Moeller said.

Fugitive financier extradited to Italy from France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The fugitive Italian financier who headed a shadowy
Masonic lodge was returning home to face a 12-year prison sentence
on Friday after being extradited by France, the ANSA news agency
said.
	   Licio Gelli, 79, fled Italy in May just as he was to begin
serving the sentence for bank fraud. He was arrested on the French
Riviera in September. Gelli decided not to fight extradition
because of his poor health.
	   ANSA said Gelli would be taken by ambulance to a prison hospital
in Tuscany upon his arrival in Rome.
	   In his heyday, Gelli was once one of Italy's biggest influence
peddlers and the head of a the powerful, secretive Masonic lodge
P-2, or Propaganda 2. The lodge was exposed in the 1980s and
accused of plotting to install a right-wing dictatorship in Italy.
	   He was convicted in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, then
Italy's largest bank. The collapse touched off a huge financial
scandal for the Vatican because the Vatican Bank owned part of
Ambrosiano.
	   Gelli's May escape was not his first. He bribed his way out of a
Swiss prison in 1983, a year after his arrest in connection with an
investigation of P-2. He surrendered in that same city four years
later, and was extradited to Italy in 1988.
	   After he fled the last time, police found millions of dollars in
gold bars and cash in his villa in Tuscany, fueling rumors that
Gelli had amassed a fortune during his years as a Fascist
functionary in World War II.

U.N. envoy begins shuttle diplomacy on divided Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The U.N.'s resident representative in
Cyprus started on Friday a series of meeting with leaders of the
estranged Greek and Turkish communities in the U.N.'s latest bid to
reunite this war-divided island.
	   Ann Hercus met President Glafcos Clerides in Nicosia and said
she would meet with Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Wednesday in the Turkish-occupied part of the capital.
	   Hercus, from New Zealand, said she was due to meet Clerides
again next Thursday, but revealed nothing on the substance of her
talks with Clerides.
	   The shuttle diplomacy is aimed at finding sufficient common
ground to restart direct negotiations to end the unofficial
division of Cyprus caused by Turkey's 1974 invasion and the
subsequent occupation of the northern third of the Mediterranean
island.
	   The invasion was in response to a coup inspired by the Greek
military to unite Cyprus with Greece. The island's two communities
have lived apart since then on either sides of a ``green line,''
which is policed by a U.N. force.
	   Clerides and Denktash last met in Switzerland in August last
year for U.N.-sponsored negotiations that failed to narrow their
differences. Denktash has since said that he had no wish to resume
talks unless the Greek Cypriots, whose government is the only
internationally recognized administration on the island, withdraws
its bid to join the European Union. His other pre-condition is that
the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is
recognized.
	   Clerides, whose government began membership talks with the EU in
March, has rejected both conditions.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Children who were wounded or
lost parents in the terrorist bombing of a U.S. Embassy
held flickering candles and bouquets of roses at a
memorial service near the wreckage Friday.
	   ``Let the light shine into a new day,'' and ``A day of
hope,'' said posters held by the children.
	   The U.S. embassies in Kenya and neighboring Tanzania
were bombed on Aug. 7, killing 224 people, including 12
Americans. More than 5,400 people were wounded, many of
them children.
	   ``When I see the building and everything here reminds
me of the bomb blast, it is a place I don't want to be,''
said James Mwangi, son of Rose Wanjiku who died after
surviving for days beneath a collapsed building. 
	   A similar memorial service was planned for Friday
evening by Kenyan students studying in Los Angeles. They
have raised dlrs 600 to help victims of the Kenyan
bombing.
	   ``This shows a brotherly, sisterly connection that
they have felt,'' said Wanjiku Kironyo, who planned the
event in Nairobi.
	   Professor David Alexander, a Scottish expert on
disaster management, told dozens of people who gathered
outside the wreckage of the embassy that they will feel
the pain of the attack for a long time.
	   But he said Kenyans had great community spirit, which
would help them recover.
	   ``I have noticed after major disasters that
individuals, families and communities nearly always come
out stronger,'' Alexander said.

Yeltsin cancels foreign trip

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Luzhkov's comments in new grafs 9-13, trims

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still
recuperating from his latest illness, canceled a trip to an Asian
summit next month, his office said Friday.
	   Government officials said the president also called off a visit
to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were
still going forward.
	   Yeltsin decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the
November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, because it deals mostly with financial issues, Yeltsin's
office said.
	   But officials in Primakov's office said the cancellation was due
to concerns about how the long flight might affect the president's
health.
	   The president is suffering from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday.
	   He spent Friday at his country home outside Moscow after defying
doctors' orders and working in the Kremlin for the past two days.
Aides said the president's condition was ``satisfactory.''
	   Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28
summit of European countries, the president's office said.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered a potential
presidential candidate, said that he would not rule out the
possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reasons.
	   Luzhkov spoke publicly about Yeltsin's health for the first time
in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday,
and followed up on the topic while on a trip Friday to the Ural
Mountains city of Ufa.
	   ``The situation with the president's health is such that he is
unlikely to be able to effectively govern the country through the
remaining period (of his term),'' he told reporters in remarks
broadcast by Russian television.
	   ``If it's a temporary illness, you have to assess it
accordingly,'' Luzhkov said. ``If it's something serious, making
the person unable to work constantly and efficiently while
exercising his functions, then he must find the will power and
courage to say that.''
	   Luzhkov has always been supportive of Yeltsin and had never
before questioned the president's health or ability to govern.
	   ``The president must make the decision. If he feels bad, he must
tell us that,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of health problems, including a heart
bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles
speculation about his fitness to govern.
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health
problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.

Kazak official: several contenders to run for president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in three final grafs with security chief accusing
Kazhegeldin of money-laundering. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Several candidates are expected to compete in
Kazakstan's presidential election, an official said Friday, though
authoritarian President Nursultan Nazarbayev remains the
overwhelming favorite.
	   Communist leader Serikbolsyn Abdildin and former Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin are among those likely to run in the January
poll, said Kazak Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Tokayev also told a meeting of foreign ambassadors that the
Kazak media is free to publish opposition views, Interfax said.
	   Nazarbayev's government had often been criticized by
international human rights groups for restricting the activities of
opposition groups and the media.
	   Nazarbayev said Friday he was still undecided about whether to
run, though he is widely expected to.
	   He said being president wasn't an easy job and that he has ``a
family and children who are saying that it may be time to think of
my health,'' Interfax said.
	   Kazhegeldin, an opposition candidate, said he was recently shot
at by unidentified assailants, although he was not hit. He also
said he was charged with participation in an unregistered public
gathering earlier this week. He said both incidents were part of a
government effort to prevent him from running.
	   Kazakstan's security chief, Alnur Musayev, lashed out at
Kazhegeldin on Friday, accusing him of money-laundering and saying
the former prime minister has bought dlrs 4.5 million worth of real
estate in Belgium, Interfax reported. Musayev also said
Kazhegeldin's report of the shooting was a fabrication.
	   Musayev told a news conference in Kazakstan that his office
received an Interpol report saying the agency was investigating
major real estate purchases by Kazak citizens in Belgium.
	   Kazhegeldin ``corruptly broke the law,'' the security chief
declared. He added that Kazhegeldin had ``no moral right to govern
the country'' because he was under investigation, Interfax
reported.

Central bank resumes efforts to support krone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After seven weeks of allowing Norway's
currency to float, the state central bank on Friday said it was
resuming its efforts to defend the value of the krone.
	   The Bank of Norway has increased interest rates seven times this
year in a failed bid to fend off speculation against the krone. On
August 24, it raised its overnight lending rate to 10 percent, but
also said it would allow the market to determine the krone's value,
allowing the currency to float.
	   The bank has attempted to maintain a stable exchange rate in
line with a basket of European currencies. On Friday, it said it
was resuming the practice because a recent weakening of the
currency was not justified considering Norway's fundamentally
strong economy.
	   ``Against that background, the Bank of Norway will resume
trading in currencies as a means of carrying out its monetary
policy,'' the bank said in a news release.
	   The central bank had tried to keep the krone within a range of
103 to 105 on its weighted ECU index. Early Friday, the krone was
listed at 114.37 on the index. A high rate indicates a lower value
for the currency.
	   The value of the krone has dipped to its lowest level in the
1990s. Experts fear that the country's economy is on the verge of
overheating and that a minority coalition government does not have
the political strength needed to tighten government spending.
	   Norway is the world's second largest oil exporter, and
government budget projections have been rattled by low oil prices.

Over 250 die of drug-resistant strain of malaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A suspected drug-resistant strain of
malaria has killed at least 250 people in six weeks in India's
northern Uttar Pradesh state, and hospitals are struggling to find
a cure, officials said Friday.
	   The victims were mostly women and children in 50 villages and
small towns in the rural district of Etah, 200 kilometers (124
miles) southeast of New Delhi, doctors said. Over 2,500 more
patients had been admitted to hospitals, they said.
	   Provincial health officials said autopsy reports and tests on
the patients' blood samples had confirmed the disease was malaria.
``But the patients are not responding to antimalarial treatment and
that is baffling us,'' said the state's health services chief H.C.
Vaish.
	   Doctors said most patients suffered for a week from intermittent
bouts of high fever, followed by severe cramps in the neck and
limbs, then stopped taking food and died.
	   ``We are suspecting a new strain of the malarial virus may have
developed,'' said O.P. Rai, a senior official in the government's
epidemic control department.
	   Health minister Ramapati Shastri said help had been sought from
leading referral centers in the country.
	   H.N. Sood, a senior professor of medicine at the King George's
Medical College in the provincial capital of Lucknow, said doctors
would give stronger doses of medicine while they tried to find a
cure.
	   The malaria parasite kills by blocking the flow of blood, or by
leaving the patient too weak to fight off other deadly diseases.

U.S. Ambassador accuses Rwanda, Uganda of aggression against Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ In a sign of warming relations between
Washington and Congo's embattled government, the newly-arrived U.S.
ambassador to Kinshasa has publicly condemned Rwanda and Uganda for
military aggression against Congo.
	   Ambassador William Lacey Swing said in a broadcast by Congo's
state television station Friday that Rwanda and Uganda were guilty
of ``external military interference to which the country and the
courageous Congolese people are being subjected.''
	   President Laurent Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda of
masterminding the country's two-month rebel war, which he says is a
front for an invasion.
	   In the broadcast, recorded Thursday after a meeting between the
ambassador and Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo, Swing said he was
optimistic that Congo's government was on the path towards a
``democratic transition.''
	   The state broadcaster, which serves as a mouthpiece for Kabila's
government, called Swing's statements a positive sign that
``misunderstandings'' between Washington and Kinshasa were being
resolved.
	   After Kabila came to power in a rebellion over the late Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year, the State Department was
outspoken in its condemnation of alleged human rights crimes by the
government.
	   When the latest war broke out in early August between the
government and a rebel coalition of disgruntled soldiers, Tutsi
fighters and former Mobutu supporters, the U.S. encouraged a
peaceful settlement to the dispute while continuing to accuse
Congo's government of abuses and warning neighboring countries not
to intervene.
	   Kabila's government interpreted Washington's stance as a sign of
its support for the rebel cause and Congo's state radio embarked on
a campaign denouncing Western countries including the U.S. for
their failure to come to Kinshasa's aid.
	   Kabila's government has received military assistance from
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Chad while the rebels are apparently
backed by Rwanda and Uganda, which have both claimed legitimate
security interests in eastern Congo. Burundi has denied claims it
is supporting the insurgents.
	   Rwandan and Ugandan troops and military equipment have been
spotted with increasing frequency alongside rebel forces in eastern
Congo, where they control a swath of territory.
	   ``I am repeating now that we have always said that the military
interference in the internal affairs of the Democratic Republic of
Congo is unacceptable to us,'' Swing said.
	   A five-member Congolese rebel delegation led by Jean-Pierre
Ondekane has met with State Department officials to discuss the
situation in Congo, a U.S. official said Thursday.
	   Swing said the rebel delegation had been received ``at a very
low level, and that is all there is to it.''
	   He added that his recent appointment to Kinshasa a month after
U.S. embassy employees were evacuated because of fighting that had
advanced to the capital's edge was evidence of Washington's
improving relations with Congo.
	   ``It is President Clinton who accredited me to President Kabila
and his government. This should represent for you a signal and
evidence of where we stand in our relations with your country. I am
here to support your government,'' Swing said.

Analysts favor Ford to take over Kia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Days before the auction of the
troubled Kia Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. of the United States
emerged as the favorite among auto analysts to take over the South
Korean automaker.
	   Creditor banks plan to announce the successful bidder on Monday
after studying takeover proposals by four competitors: Ford and
three South Korean auto firms _ Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors
Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co.
	   Kia's collapse July last year was widely believed to have
triggered South Korea's economic crisis. Ford already holds 17
percent of Kia with its Japanese partner Mazda Motor Corp.
	   ``Both the government and creditor banks want Ford,'' said Kim
Tae-kyong, an auto analyst at Seoul's Boram Securities Co. ``Ford
will bring with it a boost to foreign investors' confidence in
South Korea.''
	   But Kim and other analysts quickly added that although Ford is
the best choice for the economy, the tough auction criteria can
land Kia in the hands of one of the country's already highly
leveraged conglomerates.
	   ``The government will be at a loss if Ford fails to meet the
criteria and is outmaneuvered by domestic carmakers,'' said Ji
Seung-chul, an analyst at LG Securities Co.
	   Many analysts said that Kia's takeover by Ford would inject
badly needed foreign currency into the South Korean economy, a top
economic policy objective of President Kim Dae-jung's government.
	   Ford, the world's second largest carmaker, also has enough cash
to help Kia pay back its huge debt on schedule to relieve pressure
on troubled South Korean banks, they said.
	   ``That's something the creditor banks can not ignore. The banks
can not expect such a promise from the South Korean conglomerates
taking part in the auction,'' said Ji.
	   South Korean news media speculated that Hyundai and Daewoo may
have proposed the smallest debt reduction, which is the No. 1
condition set by creditor banks for selection of the successful
bidder.
	   The media estimated the amounts of debt write-offs demanded by
Hyundai and Daewoo at around 5 trillion won (dlrs 3.7 billion).
	   Samsung Motors, an upstart auto maker, reportedly was bowing out
of the bidding. Samsung, which has already been highly leveraged
since it began production earlier this year, is seen by most
analysts as ill-prepared for the takeover.
	   Two previous auctions have failed to find a successful bidder as
all potential buyers did not accept creditor banks' offer to write
off only dlrs 2.1 billion of the automaker's dlrs 8.4 billion debt.
	   The Kia auction is part of the South Korea government's effort
to restructure its battered economy under a bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.

City government official shot to death in eastern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ An unidentified killer shot a municipal
official to death with a Kalashnikov in the eastern Ukrainian city
of Luhansk, officials said Friday.
	   Oleksiy Vyshnevsky, a member of the Luhansk city council and
director of a trading company, was shot earlier this week in what
police called a contract killing, said Volodymyr Budnikov, chief of
the Interior Ministry's department in Luhansk.
	   Budnikov said the killing might have been linked to Vyshnevsky's
recent victory in a court dispute with another company over control
of the city's outdoor markets, the Interfax news agency reported.

Eight killed in explosion in Kyrgyzstan

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An explosion at a car repair shop in the capital
of Kyrgyzstan killed at least eight people, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   The explosion occurred near oxygen tanks, ITAR-Tass said. It
destroyed the shop in Bishkek, reduced one car to rubble and
damaged two others, it said, quoting the Emergencies Ministry in
the Central Asian country.
	   The Interior Ministry and Kyrgyz prosecutor's office are
investigating the cause of the blast, but early signs point to poor
safety standards, ITAR-Tass said.

Mahathir says he's shocked by Anwar's injuries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with report of Mahathir's comments about
Anwar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said Friday he was
shocked by the black eye and bruises that dissident Anwar Ibrahim
suffered in police custody and he pledged there would be no
cover-up of what happened.
	   ``We are as much upset and angry over this thing as anybody else
because we don't treat prisoners like that,'' Mahathir Mohamad was
quoted by Kyodo News agency as telling Japanese reporters.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy premier and finance minister in
early September. Anwar then began criticizing Mahathir publicly,
was arrested and later appeared at court hearings with a black eye,
bruises and a neck brace.
	   Anwar said police had beaten him until he fell unconscious on
his first night of detention. He was advised to wear a neck brace
after a medical examination.
	   The government has offered no explanation of the injuries, but
Mahathir has raised the possibility that they were self-inflicted.
On Friday, the premier was quoted as saying that other prisoners
held under the strict Internal Security Act had not suffered
similar injuries.
	   ``All the others who are detained said that they were treated
very well,'' Mahathir said, according to Kyodo. ``So I want to
know, how is it that he gets a black eye when others did not get a
black eye?''
	   Stressing there would be ``no cover-up,'' he said, ``These
things happen when in police custody, so we have to find out who is
wrong, who has done this thing and take necessary action against
the person concerned,'' Kyodo reported.
	   Mahathir arrived in Japan on Friday for five days of talks with
business leaders and bankers, on his first trip out of Malaysia
since his firing of Anwar sparked political turmoil.
	   Earlier Friday, Mahathir defended his use of currency controls
on Friday, saying his country would keep regulating the flow of
money across its borders to step speculative trading.
	   Mahathir was quoted by the Malaysian national Bernama news
agency as saying that controls he imposed last month had created a
more predictable environment for doing business.
	   Mahathir spoke in Tokyo at a press conference closed to
reporters from outside Japan or Malaysia.
	   The Malaysian was quoted as saying by Kyodo that his government
would continue with the policy until the international community
steps in to regulate currency trading.
	   Malaysia enacted strict controls Sept. 1 to peg its currency to
the U.S. dollar, ban trading of Malaysian shares in foreign
markets, and restrict capital flows in and out of the country.
	   Mahathir's meetings in Tokyo were expected to include
discussions on loans from Japan to help Malaysia deal with its
economic problems.
	   Despite a deep recession of its own, Japan has provided billions
of dollars in financial support to Asian countries since the
region's financial crisis began more than a year ago.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for
work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the April peace agreement was the
work of other Northern Ireland political leaders, as well as the
governments of the United Kingdom, the United States and Ireland.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also
include Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
	   At his news conference, Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis
Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of
the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to discuss the
deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   Trimble, in Denver on a trip to promote investment in Northern
Ireland, was not immediately available for comment.
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for founding the
International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   Sejersted said the committee knows that there is a risk of
setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords
were ratified.
	   But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right
track, and that there is reason for optimism,'' the chairman said.
``We wanted to give it a push.''
	   Hume was credited with boosting the peace process through
diplomacy.
	   It was Hume who envisioned the talks' broad agenda, arguing they
must be based on close cooperation between the British and Irish
governments, be overseen by neutral figures, and their results be
ratified by public referendums in both parts of Ireland.
	   Hume began the thaw in Belfast's frigid political landscape in
1993 by courting Adams in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire.
	   Trimble would have been viewed as a peacebreaker more than a
peacemaker three years ago.
	   He was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 after championing
the rights of Protestants and has since battled to keep control of
his party _ and his party at the negotiating table.
	   He refused to talk directly to Adams during the eight months
Sinn Fein was at the same table, knowing to do so would risk
political suicide. But he agreed to more than many observers
thought he could manage in April's agreement, watching key aides
abandon him as he accepted a deal that would free IRA members
without assurances that the outlawed group would disarm.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern, both mentioned a possible winners of this year's
peace prize, immediately praised the decision.
	   ``There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
than David Trimble and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is
a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership.''
	   Ahern called it ``a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects'' of the peace agreement.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   Last year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Jody Williams of
the United States and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines
for their efforts to ban antipersonnel mines because they kill more
civilians than soldiers.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

	   ROME (AP) _ The fugitive financier who ran a shadowy Masonic
lodge that played a key role in one of Italy's biggest postwar
scandals came home under police escort Friday to face a 12-year
prison sentence after being extradited by France.
	   Licio Gelli, 79, fled Italy in May just as he was to begin
serving the sentence for bank fraud. He was arrested on the French
Riviera in September.
	   Because of his poor health, Gelli agreed on Oct. 7 not to fight
extradition, but his departure was delayed by his heart problems.
He had been hospitalized at the Sainte-Marguerite hospital in
Marseille.
	   A fleet of police cars and at least two doctors met Gelli's
plane when it landed in Rome Friday afternoon, the ANSA news agency
said. The agency said Gelli would be taken to a prison hospital in
Tuscany.

Wales manager basks in glory while Hoddle suffers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two inspirational performances from his players
earned rave reviews for one English soccer coach after this week's
European Championship qualifying games. It wasn't Glenn Hoddle.
	   While England coach Hoddle was slammed by the media and his
players twice booed off the field after unsatisfactory performances
against Bulgaria and Luxembourg, Bobby Gould was basking in the
glory of impressive wins by Wales over Denmark and Belarus.
	   The six points put the Welsh up with Italy atop Group 1, with
the Danes and Switzerland, considered far stronger teams than
Wales, trailing far behind after a 1-1 tie.
	   ``The results on Wednesday night were perfection but this group
could be opened again,'' said the much traveled Gould, who either
played for or managed 14 clubs before turning to international
management.
	   ``You wouldn't fancy going to Belarus and Italy won't relish
Copenhagen. The Swiss are going to be like a wounded animal after
losing that late goal against Denmark bit I think we'll carry on
giving out a few bloody noses.''
	   If only Hoddle could sound so unbeat.
	   England's 3-0 victory over Luxembourg followed a 2-1 loss to
Sweden and a 0-0 tie at home to Bulgaria and Hoddle's team, which
was strongly favored to top the group, is two points behind Poland
and the Swedes having played one game more.
	   The English players were derided by the newspapers for lacking
fire in both games. The team produced a tepid performance and
failed to beat Bulgaria at Wembley on Saturday and then scored only
three against the part-timers of Luxembourg, who missed a penalty.
The media wanted something like 7-0.
	   By contrast, the Welsh _ despite missing Ryan Giggs and John
Hartson through injury and Gary Speed who was suspended _ thrilled
their fans with non-stop performances against tough opponents.
	   After winning 2-1 in Copenhagen, they came from behind to beat
the Belorussians 3-2 in Cardiff.
	   Gould was delighted with their wins but didn't want to get
carried away. After all, Wales has not qualified for a major
international championship since the 1958 World Cup despite having
star quality players such as John Charles, John Toshack, Neville
Southall, Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders and Giggs.
	   While Hoddle suffered under the weight of media criticism, Gould
didn't want to gloat.
	   ``I feel lucky to be involved in the game. I have achieved a
level I didn't think I could ever attain,'' said the former
Coventry and Wimbledon manager who also had successful spells as a
player for Arsenal, Wolves and West Ham.
	   ``The manager has become the pinnacle but really it's about how
to get the best out of the players. They have got to believe in
themselves,'' he said.
	   ``I have played and managed 14 clubs and I have always been
welcomed back.''

Typhoon Zeb heads for Japan after hitting the Philippines hard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Taiwan death toll, buried houses, ship rescue in
Taiwan, typhoon location, velocity, flight cancellations &QL; 
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A weakened typhoon Zeb approached islands in
southern Japan on Friday after killing at least 74 people in the
Philippines and seven in Taiwan in a trail of destruction.
	   With maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph), Zeb was
located about 180 kilometers (112 miles) west of the island of
Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture, as of 8:00 p.m. (1200 GMT), Japan's
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The typhoon was moving north-northeast at about 25 kph (15.5
mph) in the East China Sea, the agency said. Weather reports
forecast rain for most of western and central Japan over the
weekend.
	   The storm was expected to approach the coast of Japan's
southernmost main island of Kyushu by Saturday evening.
	   A total of 90 domestic flights to southern Japanese destinations
were canceled Friday, national broadcaster NHK said. More air
cancellations were expected Saturday.
	   Disaster officials in the Philippines said the typhoon left at
least 74 people dead, mostly due to drownings and landslides. Ten
people were missing. The casualty figure is expected to rise
because several mountain villages in the northern Philippines
remain isolated.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   At least five provinces have been declared in a state of
calamity, to allow emergency funds to be released to these areas.
	   In Taiwan, seven people were dead and up to 10 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Torrential rains loosed mudslides that covered two houses in the
Taipei suburb of Neihu. Rescuers said a retired soldier, his wife,
three daughters and two other people were believed trapped.
	   Rivers in the Taipei area swelled their banks, and low lying
urban areas in Taipei county were turned into lakes by torrential
rains. Residents were evacuated by workers patrolling through the
night in inflatable boats.
	   One woman was reportedly drowned in Taipei, and two persons were
killed in eastern Hualien county when their car plunged into a
flooded drainage ditch, the Interior Ministry's disaster rescue
center reported.
	   Falling trees and shop signs killed two in south-central Taiwan.
A man fishing off a breakwater in southeastern Taitung county was
drowned and three more people were reported missing in northern and
eastern Taiwan, the center reported. One sailor was killed and six
others aboard a Singaporean fishing boat adrift off central Taiwan.
	   And at central Taichung port, 23 Taiwanese and Indonesian
sailors were rescued by breeches buoy when their ship, the
Panama-registered Elite Leader, ran aground.
	   Two persons were reported badly injured and 10 treated for light
injuries, the rescue center said. Another 368 were trapped by
washed out roads and bridges, and 183 persons evacuated to
government shelters, including 50 residents of a retirement home in
northeastern Ilan, it said.
	   Schools and offices were closed in most parts of the island
Friday, and the stock exchange also suspended trading in the
capital of Taipei.
	   Many international flights were canceled, and others arriving in
Taipei were rerouted to Hong Kong, airport officials said.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour and gusts
measuring (295 kilometers) 184 miles per hour.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers drowned and
80 missing and presumed dead.

possession of more than 1,000 ancient coins and 48 other artifacts,
police said Friday.
	   Police arrested Efstratios Tarina, 50, on Thursday after a
search of his house in the southern Athens suburb of Nea Smyrni
revealed 1,178 bronze, silver and gold ancient Greek and Byzantine
coins.
	   Other antiquities found in the house included bronze, silver and
iron Byzantine crosses, the head of a Mycenian statue, a clay oil
lamp dating from the late Roman period and a bronze medal
containing a semi-precious stone, a police announcement said.
	   ``Many of the objects are rare and unique,'' the announcement
noted.
	   Tarina claimed he inherited the artifacts a few years ago from
his father, who had imported them from Istanbul.
	   Owning ancient objects without a license is illegal in Greece.

Prime Minister defends controversial art gift

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok has
defended splurging 80 million guilders (dlrs 40 million) of
taxpayers' money to buy Piet Mondrian's last painting for the
nation without consulting parliament, but he pledged more openness
in the future.
	   Government auditors this week scolded Kok, Finance Minister
Gerrit Zalm and Dutch Central Bank President Nout Wellink for
setting up a private fund holding 110 million guilders (dlrs 55
million) of Central Bank profits in order to buy ``Victory Boogie
Woogie'' and other works.
	   But on Friday, Zalm was pictured in Dutch newspapers calmly
puffing on a cigarette after coming unscathed through a
parliamentary debate Thursday on the acquisition _ regarded by many
as a waste of money.
	   Kok said that ``the wall of the Municipal Museum would still be
bare'' if parliament had been involved in the purchase. But he
promised not to repeat the process. ``We have been warned. From now
on we will steer a risk-free course,'' he pledged.
	   Auditors said Kok, Zalm and Wellink stepped above the law when
they put Central Bank money used to buy the painting into a private
instead of a state fund.

OSCE envoy denounces Yugoslav authorities on media crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An international envoy on Friday
denounced Yugoslav authorities for closing down three independent
dailies and two radio stations critical of the regime.
	   Authorities this week closed the major independent Nasa Borba
daily and banned two other newspapers _ Dnevni Telegraf and Danas,
saying recent reports on NATO threats against Yugoslavia violated a
broad ban on ``unpatriotic behavior.''
	   ``I asked foreign minister Zivadin Jovanic about the reasons of
such undemocratic measure,'' said the head of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Bronislaw
Geremek.
	   ``The answer that I obtained was that the situation was
exceptional and this measure concerns only this exceptional
situation,'' said Geremek, who was in Belgrade to sign a pact
providing for OSCE's surveillance of the secessionist Kosovo
province.
	   Yugoslav authorities say foreign and independent media reports
of Serb actions in Kosovo have aggravated the crisis in Kosovo and
that reports of NATO threats and developments surrounding them
could cause widespread alarm.
	   The decree against unpatriotic behavior was issued last week and
applies to individuals, businesses and institutions alike. Open to
interpretation and misuse, it was presented as necessary at a time
of possible attack from abroad.
	   In a letter to Geremek, the newly formed Coordinating Committee
of independent media in Belgrade said, ``We appeal to you and the
organization you stand for to rise to the defense of independent
media that are now being jeopardized by the regime under the
pretext of alleged NATO threats.''
	   ``The regime continues repression, which has now reached
dramatic proportions,'' the committee said in the letter.
	   The U.S. State Department and several other countries and media
organizations have condemned the latest media clampdown.
	   On Saturday, authorities shut down Belgrade's Index Radio and
Radio Senta, citing their lack of a broadcast license.
	   Index and some other members of the Association of Independent
Electronic Media have for years been denied licenses, giving the
government the leverage to shut down any of them when they become
critical of authorities.

Greece could refer to European Court to stop EU funds for Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece could to all the way to the
European Court to oppose efforts to circumvent its veto against
European Union funds for Turkey, the government said Friday.
	   ``Such an effort does not have legal support and is politically
unorthodox,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
	   Greece will ``use all the methods it has at its disposal to face
such a development ... we have the right to recourse to the
European court,'' he said.
	   Since the 1980s, Greece for years has been blocking about dlrs
405 million of EU money destined for Turkey, which Greece accuses
of not meeting standards regarding human rights, territorial claims
and other issues.
	   The veto also has been holding up hundreds of millions more in
loans from the European Investment Bank.
	   Reppas was commenting on reports that the European Commission is
working on a method to free the funds. According to Greek media
reports, this could be done by placing them in development programs
where approval could be granted by a majority vote instead of
unanimously.
	   The European Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, is the
highest EU judicial body and EU members are expected to follow its
rulings.

U.S. imports to Kiev reach dlrs 190 million in the first half of
</HEADLINE>
1998 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Businesses in Ukraine's capital imported
dlrs 190.3 million worth of American goods in the first half of
1998, accounting for 22.7 percent of Kiev's trade turnover, a
newspaper reported Friday.
	   That was considerably larger than the flow of goods in the other
direction: Over the same period, Kiev-based companies exported dlrs
1.1 million worth of goods to the United States, Stolichnaya Gazeta
said, citing the Kiev municipal administration.
	   The report did not give comparable figures for previous years.
	   U.S. investments in Kiev totaled dlrs 194.2 million in the first
half of the year, mainly in the trade sector, telecommunications,
media and industry, the newspaper said.
	   Kiev authorities, however, are more interested in directing
American investments to housing and city infrastructure including
transport, the report said.
	   A delegation from Kiev is visiting Washington this week, and
officials said they brought about 400 projects to market to
potential U.S. investors.
	   Since Ukraine became independent of the Soviet Union in 1991, it
has been slow to introduce market reforms. An unstable tax and
legal environment and corruption have scared away foreign investors
who have directed less than $2.5 billion in investment to Ukraine.

German parliament votes on NATO deployment

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After appeals by Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and the outgoing government, Germany on Friday committed
warplanes to any NATO airstrikes called to make Yugoslavia comply
with the peace deal for Kosovo.
	   But in a sign of conflict that may await Schroeder in office,
some members of his future junior coalition partner, the Greens,
denied him support in the vote in the outgoing parliament.
	   The ballot was 503-63 in favor of the measure with 18
abstentions.
	   Schroeder, in a speech before the vote, said Germany had a
humanitarian duty to join the Western front against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, with the aim of easing the plight of
the province's ethnic Albanian refugees.
	   ``It is clear that we, as Europeans and the international
community, cannot accept such a systematic violation of human
rights and such a scale of violence,'' he said.
	   He said this argument outweighed misgivings among Greens who say
NATO lacks a United Nations mandate for an attack, which could be
called to force Milosevic to withdraw weapons from Kosovo. NATO
must maintain ``a credible threat'' against Milosevic in the
future, Schroeder said.
	   Joschka Fischer, Germany's future foreign minister and the
Greens' most prominent pragmatist, pleaded in similar terms with
his party to unite behind the measure.
	   But despite this week's agreement easing the threat of
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, pacifist Greens still uncomfortable
with NATO and the German military defied Fischer.
	   The party's leading left-winger, Ludger Volmer, said the vote
set a dangerous precedent and that the goal of airstrikes was
unclear.
	   The dissent cast a shadow over a decision intended as a show of
continuity in Germany policy.
	   With Schroeder's agreement, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
Cabinet on Monday approved sending 14 German jet fighters for
possible NATO action.
	   The decision required parliamentary approval, but the newly
elected legislature does not convene until Oct. 26. So a special
session of the outgoing parliament was called, where Kohl's
coalition has the majority.
	   Leaders of Schroeder's Social Democrats and the Greens backed
sending the warplanes but allowed members to vote their conscience
instead of toeing the party line, the usual procedure.
	   That drew a scornful warning from Kohl's defense minister,
Volker Ruehe.
	   ``When you're in the opposition you can abstain, but when you
have the responsibility of government you must take a stand,'' he
said.

Latin American leaders consider their economic woes at summit

summit in Cuba, TRIMS &QL;

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders began arriving
here Friday for a weekend summit to examine what they can do to
shield their developing economies from volatile swings in world
financial markets.
	   At the annual Ibero-American Summit, the heads of state and
government from Latin America, Spain and Portugal will discuss how
to steer clear of financial turmoil that began in Asia, spread to
Russia and now menaces Latin America.
	   A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port
city on the Douro River in northern Portugal.
	   Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final
declaration which will center on the global financial crisis.
	   The declaration ``calls on the international community, and
Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary
measures to promote stability in international financial markets,
which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,''
said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
	   Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America
with devastating effects on stock markets and currency reserves.
Stock markets also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in
Latin America.
	   Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind regulatory
system for global financial transactions that would place controls
on speculators.
	   They also want reforms that allow international financial
institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with
rescue packages.
	   ``International institutions must be active in tackling crises
like the recent one ... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said.
	   ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in
reference to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their
economies.
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Robert Robaina said his country had been
experiencing an economic crisis for a long time. ``And the only
thing we've learned is that if the little you have is shared
better, that is the way to go,'' Robaina said.
	   Cuba's Fidel Castro and Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti were the first two leaders to arrive Friday morning.
	   Castro, dressed in olive-drab military fatigues, joked with
reporters about their working hours and congratulated Portugal for
the Nobel Prize for literature going this year to Jose Saramago, a
Portuguese writer. But the Cuban leader, who will host next year's
summit, left politics aside in his airport remarks.
	   Brazil, the continent's largest economy, is waiting for news of
a dlrs 30 billion bailout package from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   The presidents of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development
Bank also were expected at the talks.
	   The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates
Thursday boosted Latin America's financial markets, but analysts
expected the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns
about the continent's economic health.
	   The recent economic troubles stemmed in part from the structural
weaknesses of Latin American economies.
	   That has forced some leaders into gauging the need for unpopular
reforms of their public finances, risking social unrest and
political upheaval.
	   A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a
government austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that
could arise.
	   Meanwhile, Brazil is drafting an austerity package that will hit
public spending, especially social security.

Leftist leader awaits nod to form new government

 &UR; Eds: Adds comment from centrist leader &QL; 
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Leftist leader Massimo D'Alema was awaiting the nod
Friday from Italy's president to try and form a new government.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was expected to tap D'Alema after
finishing a round of consultations with political leaders around
midday.
	   D'Alema, 49, leads the Democratic Left, the largest party in
what was _ until a week ago _ the governing Olive Tree majority.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost
the support of hard-line Communists, who said his deficit-cutting
budget didn't do enough to create jobs. On Thursday, Prodi told
Scalfaro he had failed to cobble together a new majority.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of centrist and somehow guarantee their tranquil
coexistence with his Communist allies. Some observers say that
could mean giving cabinet appointments to both.
	   The Communists split during their budget battle with Prodi, with
a breakaway faction led by Armando Cossutta backing him in the
confidence vote. Cossuta's new party, the Italian Communists, has
already given its blessing to a D'Alema, a former Communist
himself.
	   However, the hard-line Communist Refoundation, led by Fausto
Bertinotti, says it will negotiate with D'Alema only if he agrees
to changes in the budget.
	   D'Alema will also have to deal with the centrist party of former
President Francesco Cossiga, who rebuffed Prodi.
	   After meeting with Scalfaro Friday, Cossiga said he thought the
chances were good for creating a coalition with room for both
centrists and Communists, and said he was willing to negotiate with
D'Alema.
	   ``We won't rule anyone out,'' he told reporters.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.

Russian steel companies ask Gore to avoid anti-dumping measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian steel companies appealed to U.S. Vice
President Al Gore not to impose anti-dumping measures against
imports of Russian hot-rolled carbon steel, a news agency said
Friday.
	   In an open letter to Gore and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, the four companies called the measures ``hostile
actions'' that ``threaten the potential of Russian metallurgy and
put market relations ... in jeopardy,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Leading U.S. steel companies have recently accused Japan, Russia
and Brazil of dumping steel on the U.S. market at prices
dramatically below production costs and prices at home, saying it
has caused layoffs and lower profits at American plants.
	   Twelve companies joined the United Steelworkers in petitioning
the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission
for intervention.
	   Russian steelworkers have responded that Russian steel is more
expensive in the United States than in Russia, so there are no need
for trade sanctions.
	   Four Russian steel companies asked Gore and Primakov to hold
talks on a long-term agreement that would resolve the problem,
Interfax reported.
	   Metal exports by the four companies _ Severalstal, Novolipetsk
Metallurgical Complex, Magnitogorsk Metallurgic Complex and NOSTA _
make up more than 7 percent of Russia's foreign currency revenues,
the report said.
	   The leader of Russia's Mining and Metallurgical Union, Mikhail
Tarasenko, has said that more than 100,000 Russians would lose
their jobs and the country would lose dlrs 1 billion in revenue if
steel exports fall.
	   Russia is the world's fourth-largest steel producer.

Agency decries the health of Germany's forests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ About one fifth of Germany's forests
remain diseased as in the past several years, a private
environmental agency said Friday.
	   Experts of the Agency for the Protection of German Forests,
blame tree damage on high acidity that has seeped into the ground,
while calcium, magnesium and other vital minerals for the trees are
being washed away, an agency statement said.
	   The level of damage in 1998 to the foliage of oak and beech
trees is extraordinarily high, the agency said. In Hesse state,
only two percent of mature beech trees and three percent of mature
oak trees show no sign of environmental damage from pollution.
	   The trend that trees over 60 years old are being harder hit by
environmental elements is continuing, the statement said.
	   The report said there were no signs indicating improvement of
forest health in the near future. Experts say that while the
situation should stagnate in 1999, it will do so at a high level of
damage, the statement said.
	   The Bonn-based agency, whose experts work in all German states
to track environmental damage to the nation's forests, is supported
by a combination of government grants and public donations.
	   An official comprehensive report on environmental damage to
Germany's forests is expected to be released by the Agriculture
Ministry in Bonn by the end of the year.

Russian defense minister says peace accord for Kosovo will stand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 12th graf with Russian welcoming OSCE
agreement. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister predicted Friday a peace
deal with Yugoslavia will hold thanks to Russia's mediation.
	   ``We fully control the situation (in Kosovo), follow its
development and hope it will be settled by peaceful means,''
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said. ``The peace process has become
irreversible.''
	   Sergeyev spoke after a meeting with his Belarusian counterpart,
Alexander Chumakov, to discuss the situation in Yugoslavia and
their shared opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
	   He said they worked out ``concrete steps'' to counter NATO's
move to incorporate the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, but
refused to elaborate.
	   Chumakov said that the Belarusian military would be the ``first
echelon'' of joint defenses against NATO, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Russia and Belarus have signed a union agreement that stopped
short of full merger but envisaged broad political, economic and
military ties.
	   Both countries staunchly oppose NATO's expansion and spoke out
against NATO's proposed airstrikes on Serbia, with which they share
common Slavic roots and the Orthodox Christian religion.
	   Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko has promised to help
Serbia with weapons if NATO proceeds with airstrikes. Russia's
Defense Ministry issued a similar warning last week.
	   Sergeyev said he didn't discuss such aid at the meeting with the
Belarusian military on Friday.
	   Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also sounded content
Friday as he praised Moscow's role in settling the conflict.
``Russia's voice has been heard,'' Ivanov was quoted as saying by
Interfax.
	   Another top Foreign Ministry official, Vladimir Chizhov, said a
military action against Serbia would be ``an erroneous and
regrettable step,'' Interfax reported.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry also welcomed the signing of an
agreement Friday to allow 2,000 international ``verifiers'' provide
firsthand reports on whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
is honoring the deal to end the Kosovo crisis. The deal was signed
with the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe in Brussels, Belgium.
	   Meanwhile, Communists and other hard-liners dominating the
Russian parliament's lower house, the State Duma, proposed that
Russia hold naval exercises ``near Yugoslavia's Adriatic coast and
the U.S. Sixth Fleet.''
	   While reflecting hard-line sentiment, the proposal has no
practical meaning because the Russian parliament has no say over
the government's foreign policy.

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Trimble in new grafs 13 and 14. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for
work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement that was concluded
and ratified this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The committee also noted that the peace agreement that was
accepted in April was the work of other Northern Ireland political
leaders, as well as the governments of the United Kingdom, the
United States and Ireland.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also
include Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
	   At his news conference, Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis
Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of
the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to discuss the
deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   At a news conference shortly after prize announcement Hume said:
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland.''
	   Trimble, in Denver on a trip to promote investment in Northern
Ireland, called the award ``a great honor, but it's not for me
personally and I think people shouldn't look at it in that light.''
He said it belonged to the people of Ireland ``who have longed so
much for real peace to come.''
	   ``And I hope very much that this award doesn't turn out to be
premature, because there is still work to be done to secure peace
in Northern Ireland,'' Trimble said before rushing off to a meeting
of potential investors.
	   Hume's diplomacy has been credited with providing a major boost
to the peace process.
	   It was Hume who envisioned the broad agenda for the discussions,
arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the
British and Irish governments, be overseen by neutral figures, and
their results be ratified by public referendums in both parts of
Ireland.
	   Hume began the thaw in Belfast's frigid political landscape in
1993 by courting Adams in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire.
	   Trimble would have been viewed as a peacebreaker more than a
peacemaker three years ago.
	   He was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 after championing
the rights of Protestants and has since battled to keep control of
his party _ and his party at the talks table.
	   He refused to talk directly to Adams during the eight months
Sinn Fein was at the same table, knowing to do so would risk
political suicide. But he bit off more than many observers thought
he could manage in April's agreement, watching key aides abandon
him as he accepted a deal that would allow imprisoned IRA members
go free without ironclad assurances that the outlawed group would
disarm.
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in
founding the International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   ``We did hope it would have more of an effect than it did,''
said Sejersted. But he said that just illustrated what a long and
complicated process seeking peace in Northern Ireland has been.
	   Sejersted said the committee knows that there is a risk of
setbacks and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords
were concluded in April.
	   But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right
track, and that there is reason for optimist,'' the chairman said.
``We wanted to give it a push.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern, both mentioned a possible winners of this year's
peace prize, immediately praised the decision.
	   ``There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
than David Trimble and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is
a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership.''
	   Ahern called it ``a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects'' of the peace agreement.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   Last year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Jody Williams of
the United States and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines
for their efforts to ban antipersonnel mines because they kill more
civilians than soldiers.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Philippine ambassador called to Malaysian foreign office

15-16 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia
said Friday he was summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to
explain his president's statements in support of dissident Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   Ambassador Jose Brillantes said in a radio interview from Kuala
Lumpur that he was called Thursday after the Malaysian dissident's
eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada.
	   ``They expressed their concern about what's happening and the
statements coming out of the Philippines,'' Brillantes told radio
station DZXL in Manila.
	   Brillantes said he explained that following the 1986 ``people
power'' revolt against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos,
Filipinos' react ``strongly'' to ``real and perceived violations of
human rights.''
	   ``I just explained our culture to them,'' he said.
	   Anwar was fired as deputy premier in September and later
arrested, appearing in court with a black eye, bruises and a neck
brace. He says he was beaten by security guards.
	   Estrada has expressed support for Anwar, whom he considers a
personal friend, and indicated he may not attend a summit of Asia
Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month.
	   He has also said Anwar should be held in house arrest during his
upcoming trial on corruption and sexual misconduct charges. Anwar
has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated.
	   On Thursday, Estrada told Anwar's daughter, Nurul Izzah, to tell
her father ``not to waver because he is fighting for a cause, the
cause of the Malaysian people.''
	   He said, however, that his support is personal and moral and not
meant to interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia.
	   Brillantes said: ``The expression of personal opinion is allowed
in our culture and it is not surprising for that to happen.''
	   He also said ``there is no connection'' between Anwar's case and
the summit meeting in Malaysia of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   ``We still consider, as expressed by our president, that APEC is
important to us,'' he said.
	   He did not say how the Malaysian officials reacted, but he said
he was not reprimanded.
	   Meanwhile, a group Philippine legislators said they plan to
attend Anwar's trial, which opens Nov. 2.
	   ``We feel that being observers to his trial will be our silent
statement of our democratic aspirations for all Asia,'' the group
said in a statement.

OSCE envoy denounces Yugoslav authorities for media crackdown

 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An international envoy on Friday
denounced Yugoslav authorities for closing down three independent
dailies and two radio stations critical of the regime.
	   ``I asked foreign minister Zivadin Jovanic about the reasons of
such undemocratic measure,'' said the head of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Bronislaw
Geremek.
	   ``The answer that I obtained was that the situation was
exceptional and this measure concerns only this exceptional
situation,'' said Geremek, who was in Belgrade to sign a pact
providing for OSCE's surveillance of strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   On Wednesday, Serbian police closed the major independent Nasa
Borba daily. Late Tuesday, two other newspapers _ Dnevni Telegraf
and Danas _ were banned.
	   The authorities said their recent reports on NATO threats
against Yugoslavia violated a broad, vaguely worded ban on
unpatriotic behavior.
	   Members of Nasa Borba's editorial staff said at a news
conference Friday that they would appeal against the closure. But
their lawyer noted that no media have ever won a case against the
state.
	   ``The attacks and repression against independent media are only
a part of the overall pressure on freedom and critical thought in
this country,'' said Novak Pribicevic, an editor of Nasa Borba.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's prime minister said Friday he met with the
U.S. ambassador to express his regrets over the death of an
Okinawan teen-ager in a hit-and-run in which an American serviceman
has been charged.
	   Yuki Uema, 18, died Wednesday from head injuries, one week after
the accident. Police say U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge was
driving drunk when he struck Uema's small motorcycle.
	   ``The accident on Okinawa was extremely painful,'' Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi said in a nationally televised speech. ``I
pray for Miss Uema from the depth of my heart.''
	   Obuchi said he relayed his ``strong regrets'' to Ambassador
Thomas Foley. Foley has expressed his condolences to the Uema
family.
	   Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Indiana, has been charged with
hit-and-run, driving under the influence of alcohol and causing
injury through professional negligence.
	   Eskridge's lawyer, Miyatomi Harushima, suggested his client
would not fight the charges in court, although he declined to say
specifically how he would plead.
	   ``I don't foresee major contests in this case,'' Harushima said
Friday in a telephone interview from Okinawa.
	   Harushima said he was most worried about how Eskridge was coping
in a foreign jail, but it was unclear whether he would be released
on bail.
	   Japanese and U.S. officials are eager to prevent the hit-and-run
from flaring up into another catalyst for anger among the residents
of Okinawa against the U.S. military.
	   Okinawans have long resented having most of the American troops
in Japan stationed on their tiny island, 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles) southwest of Tokyo. Their outrage erupted after the 1995
rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl, in which three U.S. servicemen
were convicted.
	   Uema's funeral services were held Friday. Lt. Gen. Frank
Libutti, commander of Marine Corps bases in Japan, attended, the
Marines said.
	   The date for Eskridge's trial has not yet been set.
	   Under Japanese law, a conviction on injuring someone while
driving carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison or
a 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,300) fine.
	   The hit-and-run includes other charges such as failure to report
an accident, which carries a maximum penalty of three months in
jail or a 5,000 yen (dlrs 40) fine.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in
breakaway Chechnya on Friday, killing two people and injuring two
others, a news agency said.
	   In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday
in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing
Chechnya's security officials.
	   Chechnya's ambulance service said that three to five people are
hospitalized every week with injuries from mine explosions,
Interfax reported. It did not say how many people are killed.
	   Many of the victims are children, who dig the ground to look for
ammunition left over from Chechnya's two-year independence war
against Moscow. Russia withdrew its troops in 1996.
	   Chechnya considers itself an independent state, although no
country, including Russia, has recognized its independence.

Variety of factors pushes Thailand's baht up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with quotes, analysis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's finance minister and central
bank governor said Friday the baht may continue to rise against the
dollar, buoyed by U.S. interest rate cuts, a trade surplus and
foreign inflows of capital.
	   The Thai currency on Friday morning rose to its highest level in
11 months, trading at 37.85 to the U.S. dollar. It traded Friday
afternoon at 37.925, just off Thursday's close of 37.905.
	   The Asian economic crisis began in Thailand in mid-1997 with a
devaluation of the baht which had long stood at around 25 baht to
the U.S. dollar.
	   The recent strengthening of the baht was in line with most
regional currencies after a sudden cut in U.S. interest rates,
dealers said.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said Friday he expected
the baht to continue strengthening as the United States implements
further easing of monetary policy.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday cut the overnight rate on
loans between banks, the U.S. federal funds rate, to 5 percent. It
also lowered the discount rate on its own loans to banks by a
quarter point to 4.75 percent.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul said at a news
conference that the country's average monthly trade surplus above
dlrs 900 million and foreign direct investment of dlrs 400 million
continued to exert upward pressure on the baht.
	   Although a stronger baht will make it easier for Thai companies
to service huge levels of foreign debt, analysts said the
government is worried exports will decline as they become more
expensive in dollar terms.
	   ``The central bank doesn't want the baht to appreciate too much.
Any (economic) recovery will be more or less led by exports,'' said
CIC Bank analyst Philip Chang in Singapore.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin said Friday exports to the United States
likely would decline on the baht's strength but exports to the
region shouldn't be hurt, as other Southeast Asian currencies also
are strengthening against the dollar.
	   Thio Chin Loo, an analyst at Banque Paribas in Singapore, said
the baht could benefit from lower U.S. interest rates as capital
looks for higher returns in emerging markets.
	   ``I wouldn't be surprised if the dollar goes below this year's
low of 37.70 baht to the dollar,'' she said.
	   Thailand's interest rates, although now coming down slightly,
remain among the highest in the region, the legacy of a tight
monetary policy dictated by the terms of a dlrs 17.2 billion
International Monetary Fund economic bailout package.

	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ African women must take advantage
of technological and communications advances and respond to
consumers' changing demands to claim a bigger stake in the global
economy, a businesswoman said.
	   ``If Africa women, who make up to 50 percent of 800 million
African population, are not part of correctly chosen, properly
executed partnerships, we are going to be left in the dust,'' Lucia
Quachey, secretary-general of the African Women Entrepreneurs, said
Thursday.
	   Quachey spoke at the opening of a weeklong global trade fair and
forum on African investment hosted by the Ethiopian government. The
first such gathering was held in Ghana two years ago.
	   At least 1,000 participants were expected to participate in a
three-day discussion on investment opportunities in Africa starting
Saturday.

10,000 CD-ROMs on Israeli air force seized in Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ As if Israeli warplanes menacing Lebanese
skies were not enough, a new computer game about Israel's air force
superiority invaded the Lebanese market.
	   Authorities this week seized 10,000 copies of a CD-ROM titled
Israeli air force, which was released on the 50th anniversary of
its founding, the leading newspaper An-Nahar reported Friday.
	   Five businessmen who allegedly bought the merchandise from
Malaysia were ordered detained for questioning by Military
Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud, An-Nahar said.
	   The twin CD software has information about the defensive and
offensive capabilities of the Israeli air force and a documentary
of its operations against Arab countries since the creation of the
Jewish state in 1948.
	   It also has a game depicting fictitious bombing targets in
Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
	   An-Nahar said authorities blame ``Israeli intelligence for
sending the merchandise to Lebanon.'' It did not elaborate.
	   Lebanon is technically at war with Israel whose troops occupy a
border strip in the country's south. They fight almost daily with
guerrillas trying to oust the foreign forces.
	   Israeli warplanes, on daily reconnaissance missions over
Lebanon, sometimes join ground forces in attacking the guerrillas.
	   Lebanese are not allowed to travel to Israel or have contact
with Israelis. It is a crime punishable by jail and even death.
	   It is also a crime to sell Israeli merchandise or propagate for
Israel, but the law is not clear on what the penalties are.
	   However, there are no laws against selling pirated software,
which is freely available here, largely imported from the Far East.
	   An-Nahar said copies of the Israeli CDs cleared customs and
appeared in computer shops in Beirut recently to the astonishment
of many.
	   The package was being sold for 20,000 pounds (dlrs 13). Genuine
software sells for anywhere between dlrs 20 and dlrs 150.

Wistful cosmonaut Titov envies Glenn's return to orbit

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When John Glenn rockets into space
again, the only living man to precede him into orbit will be
watching longingly.
	   ``He is lucky, very lucky,'' former Soviet cosmonaut German
Titov said. ``It is an old spaceman's dream.''
	   Titov, 62, circled the earth 17 times during Aug. 6-7, 1961, six
months ahead of Glenn's three-orbit flight. Now age 77, Glenn is
training to return to space aboard a shuttle Oct. 29.
	   On a recent visit to a Stockholm exhibit of memorabilia from the
early years of the space race, Titov recalled the excitement and
intense U.S.-U.S.S.R. rivalry of those days.
	   ``In my opinion, we should always have been cooperating, from
the very beginning,'' he said, gazing at a model Mir space station
suspended from the exhibit hall's ceiling. ``I am very glad that is
happening now.''
	   After two decades of viewing the other's achievements as
potential military threats, the two countries in 1975 arranged the
link-up of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft in orbit. An American
astronaut lived aboard Mir for 4 1/2 months in 1997.
	   When the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik in 1957,
Titov was one of the millions worldwide who scanned the skies in
hopes of seeing it. He recently had completed training as a fighter
pilot.
	   ``I never saw it,'' he said, and what's more, ``I was very
skeptical'' that plans to send a man into space would ever be
realized.
	   Nevertheless, he enrolled in the first cosmonauts group in 1960,
and had a front-row seat when Lt. Yuri Gagarin blasted off April
12, 1961, into space, history and public acclaim.
	   For a long time, Titov brooded that he should have been chosen.
But now he admits that Gagarin's good looks and vibrant personality
were important ``right stuff'' ingredients.
	   ``Everything about Gagarin was suitable to be first,'' Titov
said through a translator. ``After a while, we can see it was
right. He was not only a Soviet cosmonaut. He was the world's first
astronaut. He was right for that.''
	   Gagarin died in a plane crash in 1968. The first American in
space, Alan Shepard, who went up 23 days after Gagarin, died this
year.
	   Like Glenn, now a senator representing Ohio, Titov eventually
went into politics, becoming a member of the Russian parliament. He
wishes the parallels would continue with a chance to go back into
space himself.
	   But though he looks fit and at age 62, is 15 years younger than
Glenn, that won't happen, Titov said, because of Russia's political
and economic turmoil.
	   That doesn't stop him from dreaming about another chance to see
Earth through a spaceship's window, a glowing blue orb amid the
blackness.
	   ``It's unforgettable,'' Titov said. ``It's like your first love
_ impossible to forget. In a way, that is my only love.''
	   His wife, Tamara, was standing nearby, but gave no sign she had
heard.

OSCE envoy denounces Yugoslav authorities on media crackdown

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An international envoy on Friday
denounced Yugoslav authorities for closing down three independent
dailies and two radio stations critical of the regime.
	   Authorities this week closed the major independent Nasa Borba
daily and banned two other newspapers _ Dnevni Telegraf and Danas,
saying recent reports on NATO threats against Yugoslavia violated a
broad ban on ``unpatriotic behavior.''
	   ``I asked foreign minister Zivadin Jovanic about the reasons of
such undemocratic measure,'' said the head of the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Bronislaw
Geremek.
	   ``The answer that I obtained was that the situation was
exceptional and this measure concerns only this exceptional
situation,'' said Geremek, who was in Belgrade to sign a pact
providing for OSCE's surveillance of the secessionist Kosovo
province.
	   Yugoslav authorities say foreign and independent media reports
of Serb actions in Kosovo have aggravated the crisis in Kosovo and
that reports of NATO threats and developments surrounding them
could cause widespread alarm.
	   The decree against unpatriotic behavior was issued last week and
applies to individuals, businesses and institutions alike. Open to
interpretation and misuse, it was presented as necessary at a time
of possible attack from abroad.
	   In a letter to Geremek, the newly formed Coordinating Committee
of independent media in Belgrade said, ``We appeal to you and the
organization you stand for to rise to the defense of independent
media that are now being jeopardized by the regime under the
pretext of alleged NATO threats.''
	   ``The regime continues repression, which has now reached
dramatic proportions,'' the committee said in the letter.
	   The U.S. State Department and several other countries and media
organizations have condemned the latest media clampdown.
	   Members of Nasa Borba's editorial staff said Friday that they
would appeal the closure. But their lawyer noted that no media have
ever won a case against the state.
	   ``The attacks and repression against independent media are only
a part of the overall pressure on freedom and critical thought in
this country,'' said Novak Pribicevic, an editor of Nasa Borba.
	   On Oct. 11, authorities shut down Belgrade's Index Radio and
Radio Senta, citing their lack of a broadcast license.
	   Index and some other members of the Association of Independent
Electronic Media have for years been denied licenses, giving the
government the leverage to shut down any of them when they become
critical of authorities.

Former Republic of Congo president among 100 charged with

atrocities &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ A High Court on Friday
indicted 100 members of Republic of Congo's former government with
a sweeping list of offenses including assassinations, tortures,
rapes, fraud and theft.
	   The list of charges were read by the nation's public prosecutor
Placide Eleka at a press conference in the capital Brazzaville.
	   Among those indicted were the country's ousted former president
Pascal Lissouba, ex-Brazzaville mayor and prime minister Bernard
Kolelas and former finance minister Ngila Moungounga. All are
currently in exile.
	   President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who captured the reigns of power
from Lissouba during a bloody five-month civil war last year, has
repeatedly accused his predecessor of genocide during the war in
which about 10,000 people were killed.
	   The civil war broke out in June after Lissouba tried to disarm
Sassou-Nguesso's private militia, the Cobras, before July
presidential elections that both men planned to contest.
	   The war ended when Angolan troops and tanks entered the
fighting, backing the Cobras, who celebrated their victory with a
looting spree lasting several days.
	   A national forum appointed by the government earlier this year
has named a 75-member National Transition Council to help govern
the country during its transition to civilian rule instead of a
parliament.
	   President Denis Sassou-Nguesso who returned to power after a
bloody five month long war last year, has repeatedly accused
Lissouba and his associates of genocide during the war in which
10,000 people were killed.
	   The civil war broke out in June after Lissouba tried to disarm
Sassou-Nguesso's private militia, the Cobras, before July
presidential elections that both men planned to contest.
	   The war ended five months later after Angolan troops and tanks
entered the fighting, backing the Cobras, who celebrated their
victory with a days-long looting spree.
	   Sassou-Nguesso earlier ruled a one-party Marxist state from
1979-91, then lost to Lissouba in presidential elections in 1992.
	   Lissouba visited the United States last month to rally support
for a resolution to declare he had been illegally ousted in a coup
_ a step towards pushing for possible sanctions and foreign aid
cuts to Republic of Congo.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An aide to the speaker of Russia's lower house of
parliament was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman outside
his apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday, Russian news
agencies reported.
	   Mikhail Osherov, aide to Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the
State Duma, was in serious condition at the emergency unit of a
local hospital.
	   The attacker left behind a gun with a silencer, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Earlier this week, prominent St. Petersburg businessman Dmitry
Filippov died from injuries he sustained in a bomb explosion.
Filipov also had been close to Seleznyov, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Seleznyov was expected to arrive in St. Petersburg later Friday
for a meeting with lawmakers from other former Soviet republics.
	   Many Russian businessmen acquired credentials as legislative
aides in hopes that would help advance their business interests,
and many have fallen victim to contract murders.
	   There was no immediate word on whether Osherov had any business
connections.
	   Seleznyov spokesman Mikhail Belyat said he did not rule out a
political motive behind the attack, adding that Osherov was
expected to work as Seleznyov's campaign aide for the 1999
parliamentary elections, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Northern Ireland's Hume and Trimble win Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout. UPDATES with quotes from Trimble, Adams,
background on the winners' relationship &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble, the leaders of
Northern Ireland's two main political parties, on Friday won the
Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the sectarian violence
that plagued the British province for three decades.
	   Hume, 61, head of the predominantly Roman Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and Trimble, 54, leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, were cited by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for
work toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Their work culminated in a peace agreement that was concluded
and ratified this spring.
	   ``John Hume has throughout been the clearest and most consistent
of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for a peaceful
solution,'' the committee said in its citation.
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   It was the second time the Nobel committee sought to encourage
peace in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan of Northern Ireland for their peace efforts in
founding the International Peace People group, which later fizzled.
	   Both Hume and Trimble, who have a frosty personal relationship,
said the prize was not meant for them as individuals, but for the
concept of peace in Northern Ireland.
	   ``Well as you would expect, I am very deeply honored to have
received this award today, but I see it not as an award for myself
but as a very powerful international approval of the peace process
in Northern Ireland and a very strong international approval of
peace for all the people of Northern Ireland,'' Hume said.
	   Trimble, in Denver on a trip to promote investment in Northern
Ireland, called the award ``a great honor, but it's not for me
personally and I think people shouldn't look at it in that light.''
He said it belonged to the people of Ireland ``who have longed so
much for real peace to come.''
	   ``And I hope very much that this award doesn't turn out to be
premature, because there is still work to be done to secure peace
in Northern Ireland,'' Trimble said before rushing off to a meeting
of potential investors.
	   In a news conference in New York, Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, disagreed
with Trimble's cautious statement.
	   ``The only question at this time about the process moving ahead
comes from the Ulster Unionist Party. It's entirely within Mr.
Trimble's gift as a leader of his party to ensure that this is not
premature,'' he said.
	   In the days leading up to prize, the Norwegian news media
largely assumed that an award to Northern Ireland would also
include Adams.
	   At his news conference, Norwegian Nobel Committee head Francis
Sejersted was asked if the committee had shunned Adams because of
the IRA's terrorist history. He refused to discuss the
deliberations of the committee.
	   ``We don't shy away from anyone. We just try to find the most
appropriate laureates,'' Sejersted said. ``I can only repeat that
many people have contributed to this process, not in the least
Gerry Adams.''
	   The prize of 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 963,000) will be
divided equally between Hume and Trimble.
	   Hume's diplomacy has been credited with providing a major boost
to the peace process.
	   It was Hume who envisioned the broad agenda for the discussions,
arguing they must be driven by close cooperation between the
British and Irish governments, be overseen by neutral figures, and
their results be ratified by public referendums in both parts of
Ireland.
	   Hume began the thaw in Belfast's frigid political landscape in
1993 by courting Adams in hopes of securing an IRA cease-fire.
	   Trimble would have been viewed as a peacebreaker more than a
peacemaker three years ago.
	   He was elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 after championing
the rights of Protestants and has since battled to keep control of
his party _ and his party at the talks table.
	   He refused to talk directly to Adams during the eight months
Sinn Fein was at the same table, knowing to do so would risk
political suicide. But he took on more than many observers thought
he could manage in April's agreement, watching key aides abandon
him as he accepted a deal that would allow imprisoned IRA members
go free without ironclad assurances that the outlawed group would
disarm.
	   Sejersted said the committee knows there is a risk of setbacks
and renewed violence even after the Belfast peace accords were
concluded in April.
	   But ``it indicates that the process is going in on the right
track, and that there is reason for optimism,'' the chairman said.
``We wanted to give it a push.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern, both mentioned as possible winners of this year's
peace prize, immediately praised the decision.
	   ``There could be no more worthy winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
than David Trimble and John Hume,'' said Blair in London. ``This is
a recognition of their courage and their qualities of leadership.''
	   Ahern called it ``a deserved tribute to two of the principal
architects'' of the peace agreement.
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a lifesaver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   Last year's Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Jody Williams of
the United States and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines
for their efforts to ban antipersonnel mines because they kill more
civilians than soldiers.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After appeals by Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder and the outgoing government, Germany on Friday committed
warplanes to any NATO airstrikes called to make Yugoslavia comply
with the peace deal for Kosovo.
	   But in a sign of conflict that may await Schroeder in office,
some members of his own Social Democrats and his future junior
coalition partner, the Greens, denied him support in the vote in
the outgoing parliament.
	   The ballot was 500-62 in favor of the measure with 18
abstentions. Opponents included 21 Social Democrats, nine Greens
and 29 lawmakers from the former East German communists.

Defending champion Vijay Singh beats Sjoland in quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first quarterfinal result &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Defending champion Vijay Singh of
Fiji defeated Sweden's Patrik Sjoland 7 and 6 Friday in the
quarterfinals of the World Match Play Championship.
	   Singh, the winner of the U.S. PGA, led by 11 holes after 21 and
was on track to adminster the worst defeat in 34-year-old
tournament's history, but the Swede rallied briefly to stave off
the loss.
	   The worst defeat was recorded by Tom Watson in 1978 when he
defeated Dale Hayes in 1978, 11 and 9.
	   Singh's shot 10-under 62 over the first 18 on the 7,006-yard
West Course at Wentworth _ eight birdies and an eagle _ to match
the tournament-record 10-under shot in 1990 by Ronan Rafferty.
	   ``It was enjoyable to find myself playing like that,'' Singh
said. ``There are not many times you play as good as that.''
	   Sjoland was more to the point. ``The way he played was just
amazing,'' he said.
	   The other quarterfinal matches were much closer after the first
18 of 36 holes.
	   Colin Montgomerie led Mark O'Meara by one hole, Lee Westwood was
three up on three-time champion Ernie Els, and Ian Woosnam held a
one-hole advantage on Tiger Woods.
	   Singh will face the O'Meara-Montgomerie winner in the semifinals
Saturday and Westwood or Els will face Woods or Woosnam.
	   In Thursday's first-round matches, Westwood defeated Stuart
Appleby 8 and 7, Sjoland got through beating Steve Stricker 1-up,
Montgomerie won over Thomas Bjorn 4 and 3, and Woosnam beat Darren
Clarke 4 and 3.
	   Westwood was 12 under for 29 holes after shooting an 8-under 64
for the 18.
	   ``All parts of my game are on song,'' Westwood said.
	   ``When you shoot 12 under for 29 holes, it can't help but boost
your confidence.'' he said. ``I am definitely in the confidence
zone.''
	   The 25-year-old Westwood, No. 2 on this year's European money
list with a chance to dethrone five-time defending champion
Montgomerie, broke his match open on the first 18 with birdies of
between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 5 meters) on eight, nine, 10 and 11.
	   Appleby shot 67 on the first 18 and was playing well enough to
win any of the other opening round matches.

German growth falters, interest rate cuts not immediately likely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Reversing a pre-election position that
Germany's economic growth this year would hit the government's
target of 3 percent, outgoing German finance minister Theo Waigel
Friday acknowledged growth will be lower.
	   Waigel said the International Monetary Fund's assessment for
1998 of 2.6 percent growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy,
was ``close to the government's line.''
	   Shortly before Germany's Sept. 27 elections, which his governing
conservative coalition lost to the Social Democratic Party, Waigel
had surprised economists by declaring growth for the year was on
track despite increasing economic difficulties around the world.
	   Germany's central bankers meanwhile said they don't need to cut
interest rates, despite a U.S. rate cut Thursday aimed at boosting
growth.
	   An official at Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said
Germany's key 3.3 percent interest rate was already the lowest in
the world, with the exception of Japan.
	   ``From my point of view there's no reason for the Bundesbank to
shift from our tried and tested, calm, steady-hand monetary
policy,'' Guntram Palm said.
	   ``I consider these rates appropriate in view of the money supply
development that's right on target, the current economic situation
and the other not unfavorable economic indicators,'' Palm said.
	   The U.S. rate cuts have increased pressure on Germany to follow
suit.
	   European bankers insist rate cuts on the continent must be made
in a way that suits Europe's specific economic conditions. With the
Jan. 1 launch of the common euro currency by 11 of the European
Union's 15 states drawing closer, rates are dropping as nations
converge their rates, and finance leaders are seeking a stable
atmosphere.

Foreign secretary meets Rushdie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met Salman Rushdie
for private discussions Friday.
	   The Foreign Office declined to say anything about the meeting,
stressing that it was private.
	   Rushdie has been protected by the government since 1989, when
the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed
that the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' should be killed.
	   Last month, Cook met Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in
New York, and Kharrazi said his government was distancing itself
from rewards offered for Rushdie's death.
	   However, on Monday a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8
million.
	   Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward
of dlrs 333,000.

Russian space agency to get dlrs 60 million for research time sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian Space Agency expects to
receive dlrs 60 from NASA within a week for the sale of its
research time on the international space station, an official said
Friday.
	   Russia offered to sell its time so it could finish building the
station's crew compartment, long delayed because of a lack of
funds.
	   The deal was approved by the U.S. Congress on Thursday, said
space agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Gorbunov has said that Russia will only lose its research time
during the station's assembly in orbit, expected to last four
years, and the deal would not hurt the country's space program.
	   The Russian government owes the space agency dlrs 44.5 million,
which it has promised to pay before the end of the year.
	   Russia's space agency has failed to meet three target dates for
the crew module's launch because of a lack of funds, putting the
whole project more than a year behind schedule.
	   The international space station project involves 16 countries,
including Russia, the United States, Canada and Japan.
	   A cargo module built by the Russian Khrunichev company, under
contract with the U.S. firm Boeing, will be launched on Nov. 20.
NASA will follow in December with the launch of a second part, an
American-built passageway.

McEnroe has easy win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ No. 1 seed John McEnroe was an easy
6-1, 6-2 winner over Argentinian Guillermo Vilas in their Champions
senior tennis match Friday, setting up a semi-final against Mikael
Pernfors.
	   Pernfors beat McEnroe at the 1990 Australian Open when the
American was sensationally disqualified from their match because of
continual umpire abuse.
	   ``For those who don't remember when I used to get angry on
center court, the one time I didn't finish a match on court the
opponent was Mikael Pernfors,'' McEnroe said. ``I've been waiting a
long time for this match, so I'm looking forward to this one.''
	   Pernfors advanced with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Englishman John Lloyd
while Henri Leconte will meet Bjorn Borg in the other semi-final.
Frenchman Leconte beat South African Johan Kriek 6-3, 7-5.

Ukraine, European Union open meeting in Vienna
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Kuchma warning of further
divisions in Europe without EU integration, no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma warned
Friday of a new division of Europe unless the European Union takes
further steps to speed the entry of the Ukraine and other countries
of the former Soviet bloc.
	   Kuchma made his remarks following a meeting with Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima; the president of the EU Commission Jacques
Santer; and the EU external affairs commissioner, Hans van den
Broek, on the final day of a two-day visit.
	   ``We are realistic enough to know that the economic conditions
(in Ukraine) do not permit entry (into the EU) at this time,''
Kuchma told reporters after the meeting.
	   He urged the European Union to begin ``concrete negotiations''
on a free trade agreement to pave the way in time for his country's
admission to the organization.
	   ``It's high time that the Ukraine should be accorded the status
of a free market economy state,'' he said. Otherwise, he said, the
world will run the risk of a ``new division of Europe'' which the
end of the Cold War held the promise of erasing.
	   Both Klima and Santer also expressed the necessity ``phased
admission'' of Kiev into Europe on the basis of cooperation and
partnership agreements.
	   In a joint statement, the EU underscored its readiness to assist
Ukraine in closing down the Chernobyl nuclear power station, scene
of history's worst nuclear accident in 1986.
	   The EU is prepared to guarantee loans for Ukraine to complete
the fourth reactor at the Rovno nuclear plant and the second
reactor at the Khmelnitskiy power station in return for assurances
that Chernobyl will be closed by the year 2000.
	   Kuchma has said that his government was in favor of closing down
Chernobyl but that was not possible without providing for
replacement energy, which the two other reactors are supposed to
generate.
	   The EU side said it was prepared to provide dlrs 203 million for
the dismantling of the Chernobyl reactor.
	   Klima said Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger would visit
Kiev by the end of the year to discuss economic assistance and ways
to promote reforms in the former Soviet republic.
	   Kuchma returns to Kiev after formal departure ceremonies
attended by Austrian President Thomas Klestil.

Taylor equals Bradman's 334, closes on Lara's world record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, notes Taylor tying record for highest innings by
Australian, includes background on Lara's innings, adds quote. &QL; 
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Mark Taylor equalled the best test
innings of any Australian and closed within 41 runs of Brian Lara's
world record, reaching an unbeaten 334 on Friday as Australia
climbed to 599 for four on the second day of its second test with
Pakistan.
	   After resuming his stand at 112, Taylor achieved only the 15th
triple century in test cricket history and matched legendary Don
Bradman's total against England at Leeds in 1930. It also moved him
within striking distance of Lara's 375, set in April 1994 _ also
against England _ at St. John's, Antigua.
	   Taylor had 32 fours and a six off 564 balls in his 12 hours in
the crease before stumps were drawn for the day, when Ricky Ponting
also stood unbeaten on 76.
	   Playing in his 98th test, Taylor also became the fourth
Australian to reach the 7,000-test run plateau, joining Allan
Border (11,174), David Boon (7422) and Greg Chappell (7,110).
	   Despite having a chance at the world record, Taylor said he
wouldn't be upset if his teammates decided to declare.
	   ``If they think that's the go, I'll declare for sure. I'm more
than happy to stick on with the Don,'' Taylor said. ``If we bat
tomorrow, we will going from the word go. The record doesn't mean
anything. I would prefer to win the game.''
	   Taylor hit the magical 300 when he drove Mushtaq Ahmed off the
back foot to the cover boundary for his 30th four, only the 14th
different player to reach the milestone. Bradman hit 300 twice.
	   It was a long day for Pakistan, which dropped the 33-year-old
Taylor twice on the opening day.
	   Taylor's previous best of 219 was scored against England at
Trent Bridge, Nottingham during the 1989 season.
	   Taylor also broke the record for best individual innings in
Pakistan, eclipsing the 280 by Javed Miandad, now the coach of
Pakistan, set against against India at Hyderabad during the 1982-83
season.
	   Australia resumed its first innings at 224 for one with Justin
Langer not out on 97 and Taylor already having achieved a century.
	   Langer, needing only three runs for his debut test hundred,
waited 15 deliveries before getting to the three-figure mark.
	   Together with Taylor, Langer put on a record-breaking 279 runs
for the second wicket against Pakistan _ surpassing the previous
Australian best of 259 by Wayne Philips and Graham Yallop in the
1983-84 series at Perth.
	   It was also the best test partnership for any wicket on Pakistan
soil by a visiting team.
	   Pakistan's Azhar Mahmood finally broke the partnership when
Langer, after scoring a chanceless 116 off 212 balls, gave a faint
edge to wicketkeeper Moin Khan as he made an attempt to play a
square cut. His 362-minute innings included 10 fours.
	   A run-a-minute partnership between Mark Waugh (42) and Taylor
for 123 runs further compounded Pakistan's misery before skipper
Aamir Sohail got rid of Waugh, who skied a catch to Salim Malik at
midwicket.
	   Steve Waugh fell to a doubtful caught-behind decision by umpire
Steve Bucknor off paceman Akhtar's away swinger, and then Ponting
joined his captain in another century stand.
	   By the end of the day's play, they had put together 168 runs.
	   Akhtar was the most successful bowler with two for 107 off his
36 overs while Sohail (1-111) and Mahmood (1-82) got the other two
wickets.

Education minister agrees on measures to meet student demands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with two teachers' unions announcing demonstration
plans in 10th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Following a massive demonstration by discontented
high school students, France's education minister said Friday
action would be taken to hire more teachers and modernize schools.
	   Claude Allegre said the moves had been agreed upon during a
meeting with student representatives Thursday, when some 500,000
high school students marched in towns and cities across France.
	   Several small demonstrations took place Friday. In the
southwestern city of Bayonne, about 150 students briefly occupied
the train station and unsuccessfully tried to block the departure
of a high-speed TGV train, police said.
	   In the port of Saint-Malo in Brittany, about 150 students
blocked an electricity plant powered by tidal water before
dispersing peacefully after a short protest, police said. Other
protests were reported in Marseille and eastern France.
	   The students' main complaints are overcrowded classrooms, a lack
of modern equipment and heavy course loads. An underlying worry for
many students is the fear of unemployment once they graduate.
	   Allegre said in an interview Friday on Europe-1 radio he and
student leaders had agreed on ``immediate action'' on tackling
overcrowded classrooms, a lack of teachers and outdated facilities.
	   The education minister also said he was ``aghast and sorry''
about violence during Thursday's marches that left at least two
people seriously injured.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said that ``justice would be
severe for the rioters.''
	   Students expressed disappointment Thursday after meeting with
Allegre. More demonstrations are planned for Tuesday. The education
minister also said he would meet with students again next week.
	   Two teachers' unions also appealed Friday to their members to
take part in next week's student protestd, which the unions said
they supported.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks opened higher on Wall Street Friday, with
the Dow industrials adding to a 330-point buying frenzy sparked by
Thursday's unexpected interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve.
	   Earlier, stocks rose sharply in Europe and Asia as investors
were heartened by the unexpected Fed move and resulting gains on
Wall Street. The key market indexes in Hong Kong and Singapore both
surged about 9 percent, while Tokyo shares rose 2.2 percent to end
a three-day slump.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 50.46, or 0.6 percent,
at 8,349.82 by 10 a.m., after gaining as much as 90 points in the
opening minutes of trading.
	   The index of 30 major U.S. companies soared 4.2 percent Thursday
to the highest level since before the late August selloff. Most of
the 330.58-point advance, the third biggest point-gain in history,
came in the final hour of trading after the Fed announced the
second cut in lending rates by the U.S. central bank in less than
three weeks.
	   Fed officials, worried that the spread of economic instability
overseas has led financial institutions to cut back on lending, cut
two key short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point
Thursday.
	   The cut in both the discount rate and the federal funds rate
followed a decision Sept. 29 to lower its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, by
one-quarter point. The discount rate is the interest on loans by
the Fed to banks.
	   Although world markets quickly joined the celebration on Wall
Street, analysts said the surge could be short-lived as concerns
remain about the overall health of the world economy.
	   ``There is some nervousness that the Fed only saw fit to cut
rates by a quarter point a few weeks ago that's tempering
enthusiasm ... There's a slight nervousness the world economy is
worse than it thought'' at that time, said Peter Caulkett of London
brokerage Teather and Greenwood.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index of
leading stocks initially rose 2.6 percent, but trimmed its gains to
1.5 percent by afternoon. Prices also rallied in Italy and
Switzerland.
	   In Germany, the DAX index rose 1.5 percent in late trading.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues
gained 285.17 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 13,280.54.
	   But the dollar took another slide against the yen, which hurts
Asian exporters, and some analysts said it won't take long for
local concerns to override the benefits of America's moves.
	   The U.S. currency bought 116.44 yen in late afternoon trading,
down 2.29 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late
New York level of 116.75 yen overnight.
	   Traders said the currency market in Japan is concerned that more
rate cuts are likely as the Fed attempts to ward off a recession.
	   ``External problems may be eased by the U.S. rate cut, but the
problems remain with Japan's domestic economy,'' said Kenji
Karikomi, a general manager at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
	   American economists speculated that more rate cuts are imminent
as the central bank tries to keep global economic turmoil from
dragging the United States into a recession.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index rose 94.85 points, or 9.2
percent, to close at 1,119.6 _ its largest percentage gain and
highest closing level since February.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 806.59 points,
or 8.9 percent, to close at 9,777.01 points, its highest level
since May 11. Moments after the market closed, banks cut the
deposit rate, a key lending rate in Hong Kong.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's championship soccer team, Spartak Moscow,
has paid about dlrs 20,000 for damage caused by fans during a
September match against Real Madrid, a news agency said Friday.
	   Fans destroyed 570 plastic seats worth about dlrs 15 each, said
the general director of the Luzhniki sports stadium. They raided
the stadium's bathrooms, breaking toilet bowls, sinks, mirrors and
hand dryers, and tore off door handles, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   ``Such vandalism is typical of Spartak fans alone,'' said
Luzhniki's general director, Vladimir Alyoshin.
	   Alyoshin said stadium officials planned to charge Spartak dlrs
80,000 to rent the stadium, but reduced the fee to dlrs 60,000
because of the club's financial plight.
	   The top Russian sports teams no longer benefit from the state
subsidies they enjoyed during the Soviet era, and many are
experiencing financial difficulties.
	   ``Because of its fans, Spartak has lost nearly all the money it
saved on renting the stadium,'' Alyoshin said.
	   He said that Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who attended the Sept.
30 match, said that police should have moved faster to stop the
vandals.
	   In that match, Spartak defeated defending champions Real Madrid
2-1 in pouring rain in a Champions League Group C second rotation
game.

Oil giant plans worldwide greenhouse gas emissions cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Energy giant Royal Dutch/Shell
Group of Companies said Friday it plans to cut greenhouse gas
emissions from its global operations by more than 10 percent by the
year 2002 compared with 1990 levels.
	   The Anglo-Dutch group also intends to exceed emissions reduction
targets set at a climate change summit in Kyoto, Japan, last
December.
	   The Kyoto agreement called for an overall reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries of at least 5.2
percent from 1990 levels by 2008-2012.
	   Shell said it aims to reach the targets by reducing both its own
emissions as well helping its customers to reduce theirs.
	   It will also continue to develop and promote its lower carbon
intensity gas businesses, renewable energy initiatives and explore
the use of alternative fuel technologies, the company said in a
statement.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark interest
rate to 5.5 percent Friday from 5.75 percent, matching the size of
cuts made Thursday by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.
	   It was the second bank rate cut by the Bank of Canada in less
than a month. On Sept. 29 the bank cut its rate to 5.75 percent
from 6 percent.
	   Major Canadian banks said Friday they will lower their prime
rate _ the rate charged their best corporate customers _ to 7
percent from 7.25 percent effective Monday.

Typhoon Zeb heads for Japan after hitting the Philippines hard

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A weakened typhoon Zeb approached islands in
southern Japan on Friday after killing at least 74 people in the
Philippines and 12 in Taiwan in a trail of destruction.
	   With maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph), Zeb was
located about 180 kilometers (112 miles) west of the island of
Ishigaki in Okinawa prefecture, as of 8:00 p.m. (1200 GMT), Japan's
Meteorological Agency said.
	   The typhoon was moving north-northeast at about 25 kph (15.5
mph) in the East China Sea, the agency said. Weather reports
forecast rain for most of western and central Japan over the
weekend.
	   The storm was expected to approach the coast of Japan's
southernmost main island of Kyushu by Saturday evening.
	   A total of 90 domestic flights to southern Japanese destinations
were canceled Friday, national broadcaster NHK said. More air
cancellations were expected Saturday.
	   Disaster officials in the Philippines said the typhoon left at
least 74 people dead, mostly due to drownings and landslides. Ten
people were missing. The casualty figure is expected to rise
because several mountain villages in the northern Philippines
remain isolated.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   At least five provinces have been declared in a state of
calamity, to allow emergency funds to be released to these areas.
	   In Taiwan, 12 people were dead and up to 12 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Torrential rains loosed mudslides that covered two houses in the
Taipei suburb of Neihu. Rescuers said a retired soldier, his wife,
three daughters and two other people were believed trapped.
	   Rivers in the Taipei area swelled their banks, and low lying
urban areas in Taipei county were turned into lakes by torrential
rains. Residents were evacuated by workers patrolling through the
night in inflatable boats.
	   Eastern Hualien county suffered the heaviest casualties, with
six persons reported drowned, the Interior Ministry's disaster
rescue center reported.
	   Falling trees and shop signs killed two in south-central Taiwan.
A man fishing off a breakwater in southeastern Taitung county was
drowned, the center reported. One sailor was killed and six others
stranded aboard a Singaporean fishing boat adrift off central
Taiwan. Two others were killed in northern Taipei county and
Keelung city, it said.
	   And at central Taichung port, 23 Taiwanese and Indonesian
sailors were rescued by breeches buoy when their ship, the
Panama-registered Elite Leader, ran aground.
	   Two persons were reported badly injured and 10 treated for light
injuries, the rescue center said. Another 368 were trapped by
washed out roads and bridges, and 183 persons evacuated to
government shelters, including 50 residents of a retirement home in
northeastern Ilan, it said.
	   Schools and offices were closed in most parts of the island
Friday, and the stock exchange also suspended trading in the
capital of Taipei.
	   Many international flights were canceled, and others arriving in
Taipei were rerouted to Hong Kong, airport officials said.
	   At its peak, Zeb reached ``super typhoon'' status, with
sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per hour and gusts
measuring (295 kilometers) 184 miles per hour.
	   Last month, Tropical Storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers drowned and
80 missing and presumed dead.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers blocked the West
Bank's north-south highway Friday after complaining that
Palestinian police had detained, beaten and fired on two of their
security officers.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held, but denied they were roughed up.
	   In Friday's protest, about 100 settlers, including children,
laid an electricity pole across the highway to block traffic.
Settlers sat on the pole and on boulders on the side of the road,
reading from the Torah. Israeli troops directed motorists to an
alternate route to avoid a traffic jam.
	   After about an hour, the protesters dispersed.
	   The confrontation began Thursday evening when the security chief
for nearby Jewish settlements and his deputy were patrolling the
West Bank's north-south highway after repeated incidents of
rock-throwing by Palestinians, according to a settler statement.
	   The security officers' car was hit by rocks from a Palestinian
car, the statement said. The two Israelis chased the car into the
Palestinian-run town of Ramallah, where, they said, the attackers
escaped into the residence of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The settlers said Abbas' guards stopped the Israeli car, pulled
out the two security guards, confiscated their weapons and
equipment, beat them and fired on them. Later they were taken to
the joint Israeli-Palestinian regional office and released.
	   The Palestinian security officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Israeli vehicle was stopped near Abbas' house
because it appeared suspicious. The officer said the joint command
was called, and its officers escorted the Israelis out.
	   In the West Bank's Gush Etzion settlement bloc south of
Jerusalem, shots were fired from a Palestinian village at a guard
post near an Israeli settlement on Thursday night, Israel radio
reported. No one was injured.
	   Settler leaders are in Washington to accompany the summit
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They briefed one of Netanyahu's
aides about the incident, and advised against handing more
territory over to Arafat under the circumstances.
	   About 160,000 settlers live in the West Bank, among more than
1.5 million Palestinians. The settlers charge that any agreement to
transfer territory to the Palestinians would endanger their
security. Palestinians charge that armed settlers harass and
threaten them.

Best faces the worst as Redskins visit Vikings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One week after matching up with a fellow
tailender, the Washington Redskins get a look at the other side of
the American National Football League. On Sunday, they visit the
unbeaten Minnesota Vikings.
	   The 'Skins fell to 0-6 when they lost at Philadelphia last
weekend. The Vikings (5-0) come off a convincing upset at Green Bay
and a bye week, which means they should be primed, even for the
NFL's worst team.
	   ``Maybe it was good for us at the time, coming off a such an
emotional high,'' Vikings safety Torrian Gray said. ``So now that
we're definitely over that and had that time off, we can come in
and really be focused.''
	   Which is not good news for a Redskins team that has allowed 100
more points than it's scored, is tied at the bottom in turnover
rankings with a minus-13 differential and has struggled in the
secondary. The Vikings merely have the best three-pronged receiving
corps in the game in Cris Carter, Jake Reed and rookie Randy Moss.
	   ``I'm just going to try to cover one person,'' Skins cornerback
Darrell Green said. ``I don't care who he is, but I know he's over
6-3 (1.90 meters) and 200 pounds (90 kilos).''
	   At 1.73 meters (5-foot-8), the 38-year-old Green has some heavy
work ahead. So do all the Redskins, who'd love to gain some
respectability against one of the league's elite.
	   ``We've just got to be tough,'' said Washington quarterback Gus
Frerotte, who has regained his starting job after losing it to
Trent Green in Week 2. ``The situation we're in, nobody can put
their head down and put their head between their legs. We've just
got to fight and scratch and claw and do whatever we can to try and
win a game.''
	   Minnesota has known nothing but winning. The Vikings'
high-powered offense didn't miss a beat when quarterback Brad
Johnson was hurt and Randall Cunningham replaced him. All
Cunningham has managed is to lead the league's passer ratings.
	   The Vikings are plus-9 in turnovers, tops in the NFL, and a
third-ranked defense more than offsets their 27th ranking in
offense _ many of the yards they've allowed have come as teams try
to catch up.
	   ``I think everyone's taking everything right in stride,'' Carter
said. ``Younger players, older players, everybody can get carried
away. But coach (Dennis) Green has kept everyone on the same page
as far as what we're going to do.''
	   The weekend began early when Detroit beat visiting Green Bay
27-20 Thursday night.
	   Charlie Batch, 16-of-19 for 218 yards, connected with fellow
rookie Germane Crowell for a 68-yard touchdown pass that gave the
Lions (2-4) a 17-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Barry Sanders
rushed for 155 yards on 25 carries, including a 73-yard touchdown
run.
	   Green Bay's Brett Favre threw three interceptions as the Packers
(4-2) lost their second straight game.
	   On Sunday, the other unbeaten team in action is Jacksonville,
which is at Buffalo. Denver, the league's third spotless team, is
off, along with Oakland, Seattle and Kansas City.
	   Other games Sunday feature Arizona at the New York Giants,
Baltimore at Pittsburgh, Carolina at Tampa Bay, Cincinnati at
Tennessee, New Orleans at Atlanta, Indianapolis at San Francisco,
Philadelphia at San Diego, St. Louis at Miami, and Dallas at
Chicago.
	   Monday's game has the New York Jets at New England.
	   Buffalo has won two straight and seems to be revitalized behind
Bruce Smith on defense and quarterback Doug Flutie on offense.
Smith faces a nemesis, however, in Jaguars tackle Tony Boselli,
who's had some of his best games against the perennial All-Pro
defensive end.
	   Flutie faces a former mentor, Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin,
who was the quarterbacks coach at Boston College in the early
1980s, when Flutie became a star. Coughlin has guided the
fourth-year Jaguars to the top of the AFC Central.
	   ``We just kind of ignored him for awhile, and he just kept
getting better and kept beating people out,'' Coughlin said.
``Pretty soon at the end of his freshman year, he's the starting
quarterback. The rest is history.''

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A solution to a long-running border

Friday.
	   Legislators in Peru and Ecuador had earlier in the day approved
a plan that would oblige their countries to accept any peace plan
drawn up by the United States, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.
	   The four nations are guarantors of a 1942 treaty setting the
border between Peru and Ecuador. But the treaty does not clearly
demarcate 49 miles of border in the Cordillera del Condor mountains
in the highlands of the Amazon jungle.
	   ``I don't see how it could fail now,'' said Alfredo Chiaradia,
Argentine under secretary of Latin American Affairs, who is
directly involved in the negotiations between the four guarantors
and the two countries involved in the conflict.
	   The proposal to impose a solution by the four guarantors was
made by presidents Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimori of
Peru after years of fruitless talks to resolve a border dispute
that sparked wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995.
	   The countries have squabbled over the remote area in what has
become a matter of national pride on both sides of the border.
	   Chiaradia and Chilean deputy foreign affairs secretary Mariano
Fernandez said in separate interviews with The Associated Press
that a decisive meeting of the presidents of the three Latin
American guarantors and a U.S. diplomat is planned with the
presidents of Peru and Ecuador at the Ibero-American Summit being
held in this northern Portuguese port city.
	   Chiaradia said the legislative action in Peru and Ecuador freed
the guarantors to reach agreement immediately on the peace plan.
	   ``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a
proposal that implies the signing of a peace accord,'' Chiaradia
said.
	   He said the guarantor countries were calling their key diplomats
to Oporto immediately, including ambassador Luigi Einaudi.

Man sets fire to truck outside of Prime Minister's residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A sweet-potato vendor set fire to his truck outside
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's private residence Friday and told
police afterwards that he was upset he couldn't find a better job,
police said.
	   Yasushi Maeda, 47, was arrested on arson charges after the fire
was extinguished by officers patrolling Obuchi's home in central
Tokyo, said police spokesman Sumihiro Ota.
	   Kyodo News quoted other police sources as saying that Maeda
wanted to express to Obuchi his resentment at how badly his work
was going. Unemployment has been rising steadily in Japan as the
country struggles with its severest recession in decades.
	   Maeda set fire to a gasoline-doused cloth inserted into the fuel
tank of the small truck he used to hawk Japanese sweet-potatoes,
sending the truck up in flames, Ota said.
	   Obuchi and his family spend weekdays at the official prime
minister's residence in Tokyo's government district and was not
home at the time.
	   Dilapidated trucks selling fried sweet-potatoes _ a traditional
Japanese treat _ often roam residential districts in Tokyo,
advertising their wares through loud-speakers.

Yeltsin to meet Belarusian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who has recently canceled
or cut short foreign trips, plans to meet with his Belarusian
counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, officials said Friday.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who announced the
plans, did not say when or where the meeting would take place.
	   ``Obviously, we will not delay the meeting between the
presidents of the two countries,'' Primakov said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The two Slavic neighbors have signed a union treaty that pledges
closer cooperation in most areas but stops well short of creating a
single state.
	   Officials from the two countries met in Moscow on Friday to
discuss the union's affairs, and signed a package of agreements on
economic cooperation. They also signed a deal allowing Belarus to
repay its huge outstanding debt for Russia's gas supplies through
barter, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who took part in the
talks, reiterated Russian and Belarusian opposition to NATO's
expansion, which will begin with Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, the reports said.
	   Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week
because of illness and canceled a trip to an Asian summit in
November. Government officials said he also canceled a trip to
Austria later this month, although Yeltsin's office said it was
still on.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia took another step Friday
toward restoring peace to Kosovo, signing an agreement to let 2,000
international ``verifiers'' provide first-hand reports whether
Slobodan Milosevic is honoring the deal to end the crisis.
	   The deal was signed with the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe as NATO envoys were meeting in Brussels,
Belgium to decide whether to extend the deadline for the Yugoslav
president to comply with the Kosovo agreement or risk airstrikes.
	   NATO had set a deadline of early Saturday for Milosevic to
withdraw special troops sent to Kosovo to crush ethnic Albanian
rebels, allow the 300,000 refugees to return home and begin talks
on the future of the province.
	   Under the agreement signed Friday, 2,000 unarmed monitors will
be allowed to roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn the
additional troops and to reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it
is safe to return home.
	   ``This is only the first step,'' OSCE chairman Bronislaw
Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said after signing the
agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanic.
	   Geremek said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the
unarmed force and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he
had received promises from member countries for about 800
volunteers, although he did not say how long it would take to
train, equip and station them in Kosovo.
	   In the meantime, NATO spy planes will begin flying over
Yugoslavia shortly under an agreement signed late Thursday by
NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   NATO sources, speaking Friday in Brussels, Belgium, said U2 spy
planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this weekend.
Jetfighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy planes
are threatened, the sources added on condition of anonymity.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Lejla Sehovic posed to photographers with
a Miss Croatia crown for only five days. On Friday, beauty contest
organizers took away her title and gave it to runner-up Ivana
Petkovic.
	   The chief organizer, Milan Seckovic, swore it's because they
discovered voting irregularities.
	   But critics and the media charge that Lejla, with a flawless
figure, has one crucial drawback: she bears a ``wrong'' _ Muslim _
name.
	   The fracas surrounding the highly popular Miss Croatia contest
raised temperatures again in a country already shaken by recent
political scandals.
	   And politics indeed may have played a role.
	   ``My name is the reason,'' the 22-year-old Lejla said of her
disqualification.
	   ``In future they should list the real criteria for the Miss
(contest): nationality and religion,'' she told reporters after
appearing uninvited at a news conference held by Seckovic.
	   She spoke calmly, with vociferous support coming from reporters
present despite organizers' efforts to shut her down.
	   On Sunday night, nothing seemed wrong at the glamorous contest
aired live on national television. When Lejla was proclaimed the
winner, the audience applauded, and fireworks went off.
	   However, behind the scenes, some of the organizers were
panicking, newspapers reported later. They reportedly worried that
the public, and, more importantly, some nationalist government
officials, would mind seeing the Muslim winning an important
contest in predominantly Roman Catholic Croatia.
	   Seckovic denied any political motive, accusing the three former
winners of the Miss Croatia title, who were members of the jury, of
lobbying for Sehovic, thereby violating contest rules.
	   But Lejla served notice she wouldn't surrender her title,
appealing to the new Miss Croatia not to accept it. She said she
would seek protection from president Franjo Tudjman, parliament and
non-governmental human rights organizations.
	   ``I am a Croatian citizen and I have every right to represent my
country,'' said Lejla, who lived all her life in Dubrovnik in
southern Croatia.
	   ``The fact that I'm Muslim should not matter _ this should be a
beauty contest,'' she added.

Hopes, warnings after Lebanese president-elect vows to reform
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By RODEINA KENAAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President-elect Emile Lahoud's pledge to
clean up the government drew praise Friday from a public fed up
with corruption. It also elicited warnings that opponents of change
may try to thwart him.
	   Lahoud, the popular army commander with a reputation for
integrity and honesty, was elected by Parliament after he swept the
votes Thursday in the half-Christian, half-Muslim legislature.
	   The nonpartisan show of confidence in the 62-year-old Maronite
Catholic general was a rare display of unanimity in this
religiously charged nation of 3.2 million.
	   ``It shows how much people are eager to see a new president,
with a clean background,'' said Suheil Ayoub, a government
employee.
	   ``Let's hope he will be able to do his job,'' the 58-year-old
Sunni Muslim Beirut resident added.
	   In his first public comments, Lahoud vowed to make sure that
people in the government adhere to the rule of law, beginning at
the top.
	   Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day
President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
	   His promise of a new style presidency, free of pomp and full of
action, touched a nerve with a public that has come to view
political office as a sure way to make a quick fortune.
	   ``The country needs someone honest to run it and cleanse it from
the villains,'' said Mahmoud Bitar, a 47-year-old coffee Shiite
Muslim shop owner in the southern port city of Tyre.
	   But newspaper editorials warned Friday that Lahoud _ even though
backed by dominant neighbor Syria _ faces opposition from those who
stand to lose with his election.
	   The commentaries referred to beneficiaries of corruption who
have spread into the society: government officials routinely expect
bribes; powerful politicians often give lucrative jobs to cronies
or family members; others take kickbacks on government contracts.
	   Describing Lahoud as ``a moral foe of immoral enemies,'' Walid
Husseini, publisher of the leftist opposition newspaper, Al-Kifah
Al-Arabi, said that the general faces ``a very difficult battle.''
	   Talal Salman, publisher of the leftist As-Safir newspaper, urged
Lahoud to ``benefit quickly from your excellent popularity before
the losers regroup against your desired promises and pledges.''
	   No one expects Lahoud to do away with the sectarian-based
political system that reflects the nation's Christian-Muslim
diversity although he is said to despise the arrangement.
	   But expectations for government reforms are high given Lahoud's
record with the army he commanded for nine years. He is credited
with transforming an array of divided units into a coherent force
free of political and religious influences.

Indonesia military plans talks with Irianese rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian military authorities in
Irian Jaya are planning talks with a leader of a rebel band that is
fighting Indonesian rule in the western side of New Guinea island.
	   Chief of the regional military command, Maj. Gen. Amir Sembiring
was quoted by the official Antara news agency Friday as saying the
meeting with Mathias Wenda would take place on Indonesian
territory.
	   However, he added that the government of Papua New Guinea, which
occupies the eastern part of the island, would be kept informed
about the plan, since Wenda and associates are currently residing
there.
	   He did not specify when the talks would take place.
	   Wenda is a leader of Free Papua Movement or OPM.
	   The formal talks would be preceded by a private meeting with
Wenda, said Sembiring, whose command is based in Irian Jaya capital
of Jayapura, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   ``A private meeting at which we can get to know each other
better will also smooth the formal talks to settle various
matters,'' he was quoted as saying by Antara.
	   He also guaranteed that Wenda would not be arrested if the talks
failed to produce any accord,
	   The negotiations would be a follow-up of a cease-fire, the first
in the long-running conflict over the former Dutch colony, agreed
to early this month to pave the way for negotiations.
	   Indonesia took over the former Dutch colony of western New
Guinea in 1963 and renamed it Irian Jaya. Since then, a small bands
of guerrillas have fought a low-key war against Indonesian troops.
	   Calls for independence have grown in recent weeks following the
resignation in May of autocratic ex-President Suharto.

Russian interior minister: No ransom demand for British hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The kidnappers holding three Britons and a New
Zealander in breakaway Chechnya have made no ransom demands,
Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said Friday.
	   Stepashin said it usually takes six to eight weeks before such
demands are made. The hostages were taken less than two weeks ago,
on Oct. 3, while they were installing telephone lines across
Chechnya under a contract with the British telephone company
Granger Telecom.
	   Stepashin said efforts are being made to find Britons Peter
Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi and New Zealand's
Stanley Shaw.
	   Russian officials are being assisted by British police and
Chechen security officials, he said, according to the Interfax news
agency. A particularly thorough search was being conducted in
Chechnya's mountainous regions, where hostages are usually held.
	   Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in
Chechnya+ since the end of its two-year war for independence from
Russia in 1996.

Latin American leaders consider their economic woes at summit

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders flew Friday to
Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how to shield their
developing economies from volatile swings in world financial
markets.
	   At the annual Ibero-American Summit, the heads of state from
Latin America, Spain and Portugal will discuss how to steer Latin
American economies clear of the financial turmoil that began in
Asia, spread to Russia and now menaces the region.
	   The leaders will meet until Sunday in Oporto, an ancient port
city on the Douro River in northern Portugal.
	   Brazil, the continent's largest economy, is waiting for news of
a dlrs 30 billion bailout package from the International Monetary
Fund, and drafting an austerity package that will hit public
spending, especially social security.
	   Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America
with devastating effects on stock markets and currency reserves.
Stock markets also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in
Latin America.
	   Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind regulatory
system for global financial transactions that would place controls
on speculators. They also want international financial institutions
to be able to head off crises rather than react to them with rescue
packages.
	   ``International institutions must be active in tackling crises
like the recent one ... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said.
	   A declaration expected to be signed Sunday ``calls on the
international community, and Group of Seven countries in
particular, to take the necessary measures to promote stability in
international financial markets, which is a necessary condition for
sustained economic growth,'' said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the
Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
	   Cuba's Fidel Castro and Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti were the first two leaders to arrive Friday morning.
	   Castro, dressed in olive-drab military fatigues, joked with
reporters about their working hours and congratulated Portugal for
writer Jose Saramago's Nobel Prize for literature.
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Robert Robaina said his country had been
experiencing an economic crisis for a long time. ``And the only
thing we've learned is that if the little you have is shared
better, that is the way to go,'' Robaina said.
	   The presidents of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development
Bank also were expected at the talks.
	   A Thursday cut in U.S. interest rates boosted Latin America's
financial markets, but analysts expected the reprieve to be brief
because of deep concerns about the continent's economic health.
	   Some leaders are gauging whether to implement unpopular reforms,
risking social unrest and political upheaval.
	   In Colombia, hundreds of thousands of striking state workers
have hobbled essential services for more than a week to protest a
plan to cap wage hikes below the inflation rate.

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Defending champion Vijay Singh of
Fiji defeated Sweden's Patrik Sjoland 7 and 6 Friday in the
quarterfinals of the World Match Play Championship.
	   Singh will face American Mark O'Meara in one of Saturday's
semifinals after O'Meara came from behind to beat Colin Montgomerie
5 and 4.
	   In the other two quarterfinals after 18, Lee Westwood was three
up on three-time champion Ernie Els, and Ian Woosnam held a
one-hole advantage on Tiger Woods. The two winners play in
Saturday's other semifinal.
	   Singh, the winner of the U.S. PGA, led by 11 holes after 21 and
was on track to adminster the worst defeat in 34-year-old
tournament's history, but the Swede rallied briefly to stave off
the loss.
	   The worst defeat was recorded by Tom Watson in 1978 when he
defeated Dale Hayes in 1978, 11 and 9.
	   Singh's shot 10-under 62 over the first 18 on the 7,006-yard
West Course at Wentworth _ eight birdies and an eagle _ to match
the tournament-record 10-under shot in 1990 by Ronan Rafferty.
	   ``Seve (Ballesteros) once told me, if you're 10 up got for 11,''
Singh said. ``But when you're that far ahead it's tough to keep
going.''
	   ``It's fun to play whn you're playing that good,'' he added. ``I
haven't played that good in a long time. If I keep doing that I
have a good chance of going all the way through.
	   Sjoland was more to the point. ``The way he played was just
amazing,'' he said.
	   O'Meara, the Masters and British Open champion, trailed by three
holes after 15, but then won nine of the next 13 to take a six-hole
lead on Montgomerie after 28 and then closed him out on the 32nd
when they havled the hole.
	   O'Meara had six birdies and an eagle in his comeback stretch.
The eagle came on the par-5 18th when he dropped a 50-foot
(15-meter) putt.
	   In Thursday's first-round matches, Westwood defeated Stuart
Appleby 8 and 7, Sjoland got through beating Steve Stricker 1-up,
Montgomerie won over Thomas Bjorn 4 and 3, and Woosnam beat Darren
Clarke 4 and 3.

Museum pays 40,850 dollars for can filled with excrement

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A museum agreed to pay an art dealer
250,000 kronor (dlrs 40,850) to buy a tuna fish-size can filled
with excrement that started leaking after it was borrowed for an
exhibit, both sides announced.
	   The settlement ends legal wrangling between Randers Arts Museum,
which borrowed the 37-year-old Italian artistic endeavor entitled
``Merda d'Artista'' four years ago, and dealer John Hunov, who lent
it.
	   The contents came from Piero Manzoni (1933-1963), who reportedly
filled about 90 cans of similar size with his excrement in 1961.
	   ``It was made in the 1960s as a provocation to the snobbishness
in the art world,'' museum director Finn director Finn Terman
Frederiksen said in a telephone interview Friday, the day after the
settlement was publicly disclosed.
	   ``It is an ironic comment where we're receiving something of the
inermost of the artist,'' he added.
	   The can was borrowed four years ago for an exhibit on Manzoni's
work. Hunov claimed it was damaged by exposure to strong sunlight
and the museum did not take proper precautions during transport.
	   Frederiksen said the leakage probably was due to the interaction
of the can and its contents. At first, the museum refused to pay
compensation.
	   ``It's a very special situation where a piece of art has a
built-in, self-dissolving mechanism,'' he told the Copenhagen
newspaper Politiken. ``We couldn't foresee that the can would start
leaking just as it was borrowed by us.''
	   The museum's intention is to seal the can and put it back on
display, hopefully by next year, he said.
	   Randers is a small museum located 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northwest of Copenhagen.

Yorkshire abandons plans to leave Headingley
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Yorkshire County Cricket officials Friday
scuttled plans to abandon Headingley, it's test-venue home ground
of almost a century.
	   Yorkshire, winner of a record 29 county championship titles,
created an uproar among cricket fans in 1996 when club officials
announced they were investigating the feasibility of building a new
50-million-pound (dlrs 85 million) stadium at Wakefield.
	   Yorkshire chairman Keith Moss ended two years of fighting
between the club and its landlords, the Leeds Cricket, Football and
Athletics Company, on Friday by agreeing to remain at Headingley
provided urgent renovations were undertaken.
	   ``The development proposals will bring Headingley's facilities
more in line with modern standards and lift the club's ambitions of
ensuring Test match status into the new Millennium,'' Moss said.
	   Yorkshire's England fast bowler Darren Gough said it was
important for the County team to remain at Headingley.
	   ``Headingley has tradition and history and England always get a
good following when Tests are played there,'' he said.
	   ``Yorkshire have done well there over the past few years and now
we can settle down and play the game.''
	   Wisden, the world-famous cricketers' almanack, had considered
the pending move so serious that it devoted a full page to the
issue in last year's 134th edition.
	   The most recent test match at Headingley was England's 23-run
victory over South Africa in August. The result gave England a 2-1
win for the series, its first five-test series win since 1986.
	   The ground has also been the venue for some of the classic Ashes
matches between England and Australia including the so-called
Botham test of 1981 when all-rounder Ian Botham's match-turning 149
and Bob Willis' 8 for 43 earned a thrilling victory for the
English.

Report: Nigerian military leader `delighted' about Soyinka's visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Military leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar
has expressed personal delight at the return of Nobel laureate and
junta critic Wole Soyinka from four years in exile, a Nigerian
newspaper reported Friday.
	   During a meeting Thursday with the heads of Nigeria's foreign
embassies, Abubakar praised the arrival of Soyinka as a boon for
Nigeria's democratic transition program, the Lagos Tribune
newspaper said.
	   The two men met three weeks ago in the United States during an
official visit by Abubakar on President Bill Clinton's behest.
	   Soyinka, who was to deliver a lecture at Lagos' former Nigerian
Law School campus on Friday afternoon, spent Thursday visiting with
pro-democracy and human rights activists.
	   Police have thrown a tight security cordon around the acclaimed
writer, 64, who became the first African to win the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1986 and is the author of some 20 novels, plays and
collections of poetry. He teaches at Emory University in Atlanta.
	   Outside the Law School buildings where he was due to speak,
banners welcomed Soyinka home and throngs of admirers began to
gather on Friday morning.
	   Soyinka, who fled Nigeria in 1994 fearing arrest by the late
military dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, has said that his visit is only
temporary and that he plans to leave Nigeria sometime next week.
	   Since taking power after Abacha's sudden heart attack death in
early June, Abubakar has promised president elections in February
and a handover of military power to civilian leaders by the end of
May. Nigeria has been ruled by army regimes for all but 10 years
since independence from Britain in 1960.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia took another step Friday
toward restoring peace to Kosovo, signing an agreement to let 2,000
international ``verifiers'' provide first-hand reports whether
Slobodan Milosevic is honoring the deal to end the crisis.
	   The deal was signed with the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe as NATO envoys were meeting in Brussels,
Belgium, to decide whether to extend the deadline for the Yugoslav
president to comply with the Kosovo agreement or risk airstrikes.
	   NATO had set a deadline of early Saturday for Milosevic to
withdraw special troops sent to Kosovo to crush ethnic Albanian
rebels, allow the 300,000 refugees to return home and begin talks
on the future of the southern province in Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic.
	   Under the agreement signed Friday, 2,000 unarmed monitors will
be allowed to roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn the
additional troops and to reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it
is safe to return home.
	   ``This is only the first step,'' OSCE chairman Bronislaw
Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said after signing the
agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanic.
	   Geremek said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the
unarmed force and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he
had received promises from member countries for about 800
volunteers, although he did not say how long it would take to
train, equip and station them in Kosovo.
	   In the meantime, NATO spy planes will begin flying over
Yugoslavia shortly under an agreement signed late Thursday by
NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   NATO sources, speaking Friday in Brussels, said U2 spy planes
may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this weekend. Jetfighters
could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy planes are
threatened, the sources added on condition of anonymity.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ State-owned and private tourist
organizations plan to confront President Robert Mugabe over his
commandeering of airplanes that throws tourist schedules into
chaos, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   With only a few hours notice, Mugabe commandeered an Air
Zimbabwe Boeing 737 for a two day trip to Congo earlier this week,
disrupting air tours to the nation's main resorts and nature
reserves, the Zimbabwe Independent reported.
	   Hundreds of tourists were affected and there was no time to make
other charter arrangements, the paper said.
	   A lease agreement on planes with Uganda's state airline was
cancelled last month, evidently because of the two nation's
opposing views on Congo, where Zimbabwe has about 3,000 troops
supporting Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   The Independent said officials of the state Zimbabwe Tourism
Council and Zimbabwe Tourist Authority supported calls by tour
operators for a meeting with top government officials to resolve
the issue.
	   Mugabe and his wife have frequently disrupted airline schedules
by taking airplanes for business and private trips.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The audience cried out in anger as
fighters hacked a woman and her baby to death.
	   The actors in ``Flowers in the Morning Sun'' were trying to show
how warfare in Africa has degenerated from the time when it only
involved warriors _ not women, children and other civilians.
	   Written by Kithaka wa Mberia and produced by the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the play uses drama to promote
knowledge of universal standards of humanity during armed
conflicts.
	   ``War does not allow unlimited use of violence,'' Vincent Nicod,
head of the East African regional delegation of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, said at the play's opening Wednesday.
	   Thousands of civilians have died in seemingly endless conflicts
in the East African and Great Lakes region in recent years.
	   ``We decided to remind those involved in armed conflicts that
there are international rules and norms which protect innocent
victims caught in violence or conflict,'' he said.
	   The play in the Swahili language will tour other towns in Kenya,
particularly those in areas affected by inter-tribal clashes, and
neighboring countries.
	   -----
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Oil company STPETRO is to
start extracting oil from Sao Tome's offshore waters by 2001, three
years after a U.S. partner found oil in the country's waters,
officials said Friday.
	   The company, a joint venture between the government and the
U.S.-based Environmental Remediation Holding Corp., was to start
drilling before the end of this year.
	   The two-island country has a capacity of producing 80,000
barrels of oil per day with a revenue of dlrs 46 million per year,
a major boost for the impoverished country's economy, officials
said.
	   Meanwhile, the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang,
was to arrive Saturday in Sao Tome to discuss territorial waters
with his Sao Tome counterpart Miguel Trovoada.
	   Sao Tome has accused Obiang's country of drilling in Sao Tome
waters.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the
most active exploration areas in the African continent.
	   -----
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The one-time secret
brotherhood of apartheid on Friday charged reverse discrimination
against two candidates for judicial office because they were
members of the Afrikanerbond.
	   The group said two High Court judges were rejected for senior
bench positions after they were grilled about their membership in
the organization when it was still called the Afrikaner Broederbond
_ the group of white men believed to have been the brains behind
apartheid.
	   Executive Director Boet Schoeman said in a statement that
rejection based on membership in an organization was ``indefensible
prejudice'' and reflected ignorance about the group.
	   With the end to white minority rule in 1994's first democratic
elections, the organization changed its name to Afrikanerbond,
started accepting nonwhites and women and worked to promote
Afrikaans culture.
	   Afrikaners are the descendants of Dutch settlers who speak
Afrikaans. But the language is also spoken by many nonwhites.

Ukraine's central bank chief indicates that hryvna may strengthen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank chief indicated
Friday that the country's hryvna currency might rise following its
sharp devaluation last month, a news agency reported.
	   The central bank has allowed the hryvna to fall more than was
necessary, and the currency's rate in relation to the U.S. dollar
should be raised as soon as the situation in Ukraine's financial
markets permits, National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko told
parliament, according to Interfax.
	   He did not elaborate.
	   The fall of the hryvna, badly hit by the Russian economic
crisis, has slowed this month. It lost more than 50 percent of its
value in September.
	   The hryvna was trading at around 3.42 to the dollar this week,
close to the lower limit of a government-set trading band of 2.5 to
3.5 to the dollar, introduced a month ago.
	   However, many analysts say the hryvna's stability is being
artificially maintained by the National Bank, which last month
began disallowing many dollar purchase requests from banks and
banning them from trading dollars among themselves.
	   The International Monetary Fund has said that disbursement of a
dlrs 2.2 billion three-year loan to Ukraine depends of the country
maintaining a certain level of foreign currency reserves.
	   The National Bank's reserves, which nearly halved between
January and September this year, slightly increased last month to
more than dlrs 1 billion after Ukraine received the first dlrs 257
million installment of the IMF loan.
	   The National Bank's strict measures aimed at defending the
hryvna have caused anger in the country's leftist-dominated
legislature, which advocates more subsidies and credits to support
various sectors of Ukraine's economy.
	   The leftists, led by speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko, have
repeatedly accused Yushchenko over the past week of taking
inadequate measures to battle the spillover of Russia's crisis into
Ukraine and threatened to ask President Leonid Kuchma to appoint a
new central bank chief.
	   On Tuesday, lawmakers are expected to debate a resolution
demanding that the president consider dismissing Yushchenko. The
Ukrainian parliament has the authority to confirm the president's
nominee for central bank chief.

Investigators identify vehicle used in U.S. Embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A refrigerator truck transported
the bomb that killed at least 11 people and extensively damaged the
U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the FBI said Friday.
	   The driver of the truck died in the Aug. 7 blast.
	   ``From the evidence recovered during the crime scene search and
subsequent follow-up, it is believed that a 1987 Nissan Atlas
refrigeration truck ... was involved in the bombing,'' FBI agent
Kenneth Maxwell said in a prepared statement.
	   Maxwell, who is in charge of the team of FBI investigators in
Tanzania, said the cab of the truck was white or beige and the
cargo box was silver.
	   Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried into
the embassy compound on a water tanker truck that periodically
distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential
neighborhood.
	   Maxwell read the statement as Adadi Rajab, head of the Tanzanian
Police Criminal Investigation Department, looked on. Neither took
questions.
	   But as he was leaving, Rajab told reporters the driver of the
refrigerator truck died in the blast, and the death toll could rise
above the 11 dead, all Africans, who have been counted so far. It
was not clear whether the driver of the truck was among the 11
dead.
	   On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a
bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213
people, including 12 Americans.
	   ``A significant amount of progress has been made in this
combined effort, and the investigation is proceeding with diligence
and speed,'' Maxwell said.
	   He said photographs of the refrigerator truck and a Suzuki
Samurai car believed to have been used by bombing suspects are
being circulated.
	   He asked people who might have noticed either vehicle to contact
police.
	   ``It is only through this type of alliance between law
enforcement authorities and the citizens they protect that all our
communities become safer places in which to live,'' Maxwell said.
	   Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed were charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court
with 11 counts of murder each.
	   Investigators say Ahmed has been providing them with a lot of
information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in
the blast.
	   Ahmed has told investigators he volunteered information on the
Nairobi bombing to the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam on
Aug. 8 as well as to the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents.
	   But investigators say he has denied having any information on or
involvement in the Dar es Salaam bombing.
	   Investigators believe Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
	   They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades
Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building
of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the
explosive device that blew up the embassy.
	   The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have
reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs.
	   The FBI has linked Saudi Arabia billionaire fugitive in
Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, to both
bombings.

UCI says it won't push for disciplinary action against Jalabert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Cycling's world governing body said
Friday it won't pursue disciplinary action against French rider
Laurent Jalabert after he apologized for comparing top officials to
neo-Nazis.
	   During last month's Tour of Spain, Jalabert described the
International Cycling Union (UCI) as a ``dictatorship'' and its
commissioners as ``half Dracula and half neo-Nazi.''
	   UCI president Hein Verbruggen said Jalabert must apologize or be
excluded from the world championships earlier this month.
	   Jalabert, the world's top-ranked cyclist, later pulled out of
the worlds, citing physical and psychological fatigue. He said his
withdrawal was unrelated to the UCI threat.
	   The UCI said in a statement that its commissioners have dropped
demands for action against Jalabert after receiving a letter from
the rider dated Sept. 29 in which he ``formally regrets'' the
incident.
	   The solution ``demonstrates the will of the parties concerned to
calm certain tensions that exist,'' it said.
	   Although accepting Jalabert's apology, the UCI added that it
``invites all riders to consider in future the content and form of
what they say to the press to avoid such situations recurring.''

Deal done, Taiwan negotiator arrives in Beijing

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Taiwan's top negotiator with China declared on
Friday he was happy with a new beginning in relations, but warned
there was still a long way to go to build trust.
	   After talks with his mainland counterpart in Shanghai, China's
chief commercial city, Koo Chen-fu arrived in Beijing on Friday for
two days of sightseeing, banquets and a meeting with President
Jiang Zemin.
	   That meeting on Sunday is not expected to yield more agreements,
but should highlight the warmer atmosphere between the two sides.
	   Koo welcomed the deal he and Wang Daohan, China's chief
negotiator on Taiwan, struck Thursday to work toward repairing
negotiations broken off by China three years ago.
	   Koo said his two days of talks with Wang had allowed both men to
make their positions clear. He said he was ``very happy about a
renewed beginning of relations.''
	   But Koo cautioned that mistrust remains.
	   China and Taiwan have rarely compromised since Mao Tse-tung's
Communists vanquished Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists on the
mainland in 1949, and have never signed a peace treaty.
	   After Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui made the first-ever visit by
a Taiwanese president to the United States in 1995, Beijing
scrubbed a two-year dialogue and launched war games near the
island. Relations plunged to their lowest level since the Cold War.
	   Koo said that in order to get the trust of the Taiwan
government, China should abide by the agreements reached when he
and Wang met the only previous time, in Singapore in 1993.
	   The two rival governments then planned regular liaison meetings
on smuggling, intellectual property rights, repatriation of illegal
immigrants crime prevention and fishing disputes.
	   Before flying to Beijing, Koo visited a 400-year-old park in
Shanghai and was invited to write some comments. He chose 10
Chinese characters, a literary expression meaning ``when people
feel spring is coming, they tend to forget the long waiting in the
winter.''
	   Koo, 81, is a business tycoon and Nationalist Party elder who is
making his first visit to Beijing in more than 50 years. Wang, 84,
is a former mayor of Shanghai and mentor to President Jiang Zemin.
Both men head government-backed organizations charged with trying
to improve relations between the two sides.
	   The agreement on Thursday calls for these bodies to hold
discussions on a wide array of topics including eventual
reunification.
	   Koo also invited Wang to visit Taiwan, and Wang agreed.
	   In Taiwan, initial reaction was muted to Thursday's agreement.
Newspapers and observers said major differences remained.
	   The Liberty Times said Beijing was still sticking to its view
that Taiwan is a province of China.

Solution nears to Peru-Ecuador border conflict

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A solution to a long-running border
dispute between Ecuador and Peru may be imposed by four neutral
countries within a matter of days, an Argentinean diplomat said
Friday.
	   Legislators in Peru and Ecuador agreed earlier Friday to accept
any peace plan drawn up by the United States, Brazil, Chile and
Argentina, the guarantors of a 1942 treaty setting the border
between Peru and Ecuador.
	   ``I don't see how it could fail now,'' said Alfredo Chiaradia,
Argentine under secretary of Latin American Affairs, who is
directly involved in the negotiations between the four guarantors
and the two countries involved in the conflict.
	   The treaty did not clearly demarcate 49 miles (79 kilometers) of
border in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the highlands of
the Amazon jungle, and the remote area has become a matter of
national pride on both sides of the border.
	   Presidents Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimori of Peru
proposed that the guarantors impose a solution after years of
fruitless talks to resolve the border dispute that sparked wars in
1941, 1981 and 1995.
	   Chiaradia and Chilean deputy foreign affairs secretary Mariano
Fernandez told The Associated Press that presidents Peru, Ecuador,
the three Latin American guarantors and a U.S. diplomat is planned
for the Ibero-American Summit being held in this northern
Portuguese port city.
	   Chiaradia said Friday's legislative action in Peru and Ecuador
freed the guarantors to reach agreement immediately on the peace
plan.
	   ``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a
proposal that implies the signing of a peace accord,'' Chiaradia
said.
	   He said the guarantor countries were calling their key diplomats
to Oporto immediately, including ambassador Luigi Einaudi.

Swiss struggle to cope with influx of Kosovo Albanians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Already struggling with a massive influx of Kosovo
Albanians, Swiss authorities said Friday they expect the number of
asylum seekers to reach an all-time high this year.
	   Nearly 500 refugees were forced to fend for themselves Thursday
night _ some huddled under cardboard boxes for warmth _ as
overflowing reception centers closed their doors to new arrivals.
	   ``The situation is very serious and it may get worse,'' said
Vera Britsch, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Refugees.
	   Switzerland, home to a large population of ethnic Albanians, has
acted as a magnet to refugees fleeing the fighting in Serbia's
Kosovo province. But a sudden influx in recent weeks has
overwhelmed local and national authorities.
	   The government next week is to consider plans to use soldiers to
help care for the Kosovo Albanians. And it is preparing to open
army barracks to house the overflow.
	   Kosovo Albanians accounted for the majority of the 26,000
requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the first
nine months of the year. A big jump is expected for October.
	   Jean-Daniel Gerber, director of the refugee office, said he
expected the figure to top 42,000 by the end of the year and beat
the record set in 1991.
	   The number of asylum seekers dipped after 1991 because of more
restrictive laws.

Japan's Parliament approves bank bailout plan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moving to repair Japan's teetering financial
system, Parliament on Friday approved laws to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public funds into the country's
cash-strapped banks.
	   ``I have done my utmost to bring about stability in the nation's
financial system and regain trust both at home and abroad,'' Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters after the upper house passed
the bills.
	   The more powerful lower house passed them Tuesday.
	   Japan has been under intense pressure from Washington and other
nations to take quick action to tackle its massive bad-loans
problem, estimated at up to dlrs 1 trillion, left over from the
excessive lending of the 1980s.
	   The credit crunch brought on by the banks' tight hold on capital
has been a major factor behind Japan's recession _ the worst since
the end of World War II.
	   Juichi Yamanaka, a senior economist at NLI Research Institute, a
Tokyo think tank, said the bills' passage is an effective message
to the world that Japan is determined to fix its troubled financial
system.
	   ``The main problem is whether the money will be used wisely to
produce results,'' Yamanaka said. ``At least, it shows the nation's
resolve.''
	   Japanese finance officials have urged banks to take advantage of
the cash pool. But some say that banks may be too afraid of the
stringent requirements for management accountability attached to
the money.
	   How Japanese banks, long used to keeping the public in the dark
about their management policies, will adapt to the new demands for
more transparency remains another question.
	   Wrangling in Parliament over the bills that continued for weeks
between the ruling party and the opposition were precisely over
such demands.
	   Skepticism also remains whether Japanese bureaucrats, more used
to propping up poorly managed banks, will really let them fail.
	   Friday's laws, which promise money to weakened banks that have
yet to fail, make up the second part of a package to stabilize
Japan's financial system.
	   The first part of the plan, which became law Oct. 12, enables
the government to nationalize banks that have failed or are about
to go under.
	   The government is expected to try out the scheme on the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's biggest banks,
which has been on the verge of collapse under the weight of bad
real estate loans.
	   Although Obuchi refused to say exactly what would be done with
the Long-Term Credit Bank, he welcomed the passage of the laws as
``the two wheels of a vehicle'' toward economiAible, Parliament also approved a
supplementary budget for this year.
	   Under the new package, 25 trillion yen (dlrs 215 billion) will
go into providing capital for weak banks, while 18 trillion yen
(dlrs 155 billion) was set aside for the government to purchase
failed banks from their stockholders.
	   The total earmarked to fix the bank problem, including a
previously approved 17 trillion yen (dlrs 146) to ensure
depositors, is larger than the size of the Australian economy.

United's dynasty shows no signs of decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In the nation's capital, even the non-soccer
fans know that D.C. United is good.
	   They may not know that United has won 13 straight playoff games
and is two victories away from its third Major League Soccer
championship.
	   They may not know that United averaged 16,007 fans a game this
season, roughly on a par with the Wizards of the National
Basketball Association or the Capitals of the North American
National Hockey League. They may not know that United has its
headquarters and training facilities at the old Redskin Park, while
some other MLS teams have had to search almost daily for a place to
practice during the league's three-year existence.
	   They just know that United dominated the fledgling MLS from Year
One.
	   After they won the CONCACAF Champions Cup in August, crowning
them the best in North and Central America after only 2 1-2 years
of existence, many have been asking just what makes D.C. so good.
	   To find the answer, simply talk to someone who has played
elsewhere.
	   David Vaudreuil, a two-year starter with United and now with the
Colorado Rapids, visited his old teammates as they prepared for
Sunday's Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals in Columbus, Ohio.
United leads the best-of-three series 1-0.
	   ``In the end, it's the players,'' Vaudreuil said. ``But you have
to give a lot of credit to the stability and the direction of the
front office. A lot teams have good players, but they don't have
the same chemistry, the same preparation that allows them to go out
and win games.''
	   Indeed, United has the best players in America, the best coach,
the best facilities, shrewd management and a solid fan base. It is
a professionally run flagship franchise in a league where other
teams struggle with simple things like training sites.
	   ``In Tampa, we practiced on any field that was available to
us,'' said forward Roy Lassiter, who has scored 18 goals after
coming from the Tampa Bay Mutiny in an early season
steal-of-a-trade for Roy Wegerle. ``Whether it was a decent field
... a field with no goals on it, we didn't know what field we were
practicing on the next day.''
	   In Washington, Lassiter has discovered an atmosphere where
winning breeds winning, where the expectation that United will take
the MLS Cup '98 on Oct. 25 in Pasadena, California, is unquestioned
_ and reflected in the relaxed confidence on the practice field.
	   ``We'll all on the same page,'' Lassiter said. ``We all have the
goal, and our mission in not completed until we win that third
championship.''
	   With probable player of the year Marco Etcheverry, the Bolivian
midfielder they call ``El Diablo'', feeding the ball to Lassiter
and countryman Jaime Moreno (16 goals), a defense that includes
U.S. internationals Eddie Pope and Jeff Agoos, the leadership of
John Harkes, and the dynamic talent of one of the country's best
young talents, Ben Olsen, it's not hard to see why United's success
starts with its players.
	   But it doesn't end there. United is truly united _ every member
of the team showed up for a cookout at Harkes' house. President and
general manager Kevin Payne has kept the talent well deep, even
though the league has tried to restore parity by allocating fewer
incoming talents to United.
	   With Payne pulling off deals like the Lassiter trade, it makes
it easier to survive the loss of players such as Vaudreuil via the
expansion draft and the trade of prolific scorer Raul Diaz Arce of
El Salvador because of salary-cap concerns.
	   Finally, there's coach Bruce Arena, who won five U.S. college
national titles at Virginia before taking over United.
	   Other than a slow start in 1996 when he was distracted by his
coaching stint with the U.S. Olympic team, Arena has a been firm,
guiding force. There's no question he's in charge when he walks on
the field, yet just about any of his players, past or present,
would run though a wall for him.
	   ``He's a good leadership figure,'' Vaudreuil said. ``He gives
the players the reins to do what they need to do to be successful.
He doesn't try to micro-manage and over-coach.''
	   How long can United keep it up? Next year will be pivotal. The
team is owned by a limited partnership, coordinated by Payne, and
one of the groups wants to sell. Payne would like to put together a
new partnership, but it's not out of the question that a rich
soccer fan could buy the team and install new staff and management.
	   Then there's Arena, who will probably be offered the U.S.
national team job at the end of the season. Payne is also mulling
replacements, but Arena left no doubt that the dynasty will
continue after he's gone.
	   ``It's not about your organization, it's not about your
facilities,'' Arena said. ``It's about the 11 players on the field.
You ask why we're good, and I say good players. If I'm not here, we
have good players.''

Peru, Ecuador congresses vote for imposed solution to border

 &UR; With Peru-Ecuador Border &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Legislators in Peru and Ecuador voted Friday
to give the United States and three other neutral countries the
power to impose a solution to end a long-running border dispute
that erupted in war in 1995.
	   Leaders of the South American neighbors had called for outside
help to save three years of negotiations that had failed to reach
an agreement over where to mark a remote stretch of disputed
border.
	   Ecuador and Peru will be obliged to accept any peace plan
prepared by the United States, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, which
are the guarantors of a 1942 treaty that set the 1,050-mile (1,700
kilometer) border between the nations.
	   But the 1942 treaty did not clearly demarcate 49 miles (79
kilometers) of border in the jungle-covered Cordillera del Condor
mountains and the nations have squabbled over the remote area ever
since.
	   The guarantor nations had demanded prior approval by each
country's Congress before agreeing to settle the dispute.
	   An Argentine diplomat in Portugal, where Latin American leaders
will meet this weekend for an Ibero-American summit, said the final
peace agreement could be reached within a week.
	   ``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a
proposal that implies the signing of a peace agreement,'' said
Argentine diplomat Alfredo Chiaradia.
	   After an emotional 12-hour debate in which legislators waved the
nation's flag, Peru's Congress approved the proposal before dawn
Friday by 87 votes for, 26 against and one abstention.
	   The proposal had the support of President Alberto Fujimori and
Peru's armed forces. Opposition leaders protested that agreeing to
an outside settlement before knowing what it was could threaten
Peru's sovereignty.
	   ``Today's decision is decisive because it will finally
consolidate our nation's territory and demarcate the border under
the legal terms that Peru has always demanded,'' said Foreign
Minister Fernando de Trazegnies.
	   In Ecuador, legislators approved the proposal Friday morning by
96 votes for, 21 against and two abstentions.
	   Ecuador's new President Jamil Mahuad had lobbied strongly for
the proposal, saying the countries needed an outside judge to
settle the 56-year dispute and avoid a war.
	   The talks had stumbled over where to demarcate the border. The
countries have fought wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995.

Leftist leader awaits nod to form new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD that D'Alema would be Italy's first
premier to come out of Communist Party; other background
throughout. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Leftist leader Massimo D'Alema was awaiting the
president's nod Friday to try to form a new government, potentially
making him Italy's first premier to emerge from the old Communist
Party.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro completed a round of
consultations with political leaders at midday Friday. He was
expected to ask D'Alema to take a shot at forming a new governing
majority sometime afterward.
	   D'Alema, 49, leads the Democratic Left, a more moderate
successor of what until earlier in the 1990s was Italy's Communist
Party. The Democratic Left was _ until a week ago _ the largest
party in what was the governing Olive Tree majority.
	   Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost
the support of hard-core Communists, who said his deficit-cutting
budget didn't do enough to create jobs. On Thursday, Prodi told
Scalfaro he had failed to cobble together a new majority.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of centrist and somehow guarantee their tranquil
coexistence with his hard-line Communist allies. Some observers say
that could mean giving Cabinet appointments to both.
	   The Communists split during their budget battle with Prodi, with
a breakaway faction led by Armando Cossutta backing him in the
confidence vote. Cossuta's new party, the Italian Communists, has
already given its blessing to a D'Alema, a former Communist
himself.
	   However, the hard-line Communist Refoundation, led by Fausto
Bertinotti, says it will negotiate with D'Alema only if he agrees
to changes in the budget.
	   D'Alema will also have to deal with the centrist party of former
President Francesco Cossiga, who rebuffed Prodi.
	   After meeting with Scalfaro Friday, Cossiga said he thought the
chances were good for creating a coalition with room for both
centrists and Communists, and said he was willing to negotiate with
D'Alema.
	   ``We won't rule anyone out,'' he told reporters.
	   Any government that included both the Democratic Left and the
Communists would have to overcome fundamental differences in
policy. D'Alema's party supports NATO and privatization; the
Communists oppose both. The Communists also are generally
anti-American, resenting the presence of U.S. bases on Italian
soil.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.
Until the Cold War ended, one of the guiding principals of the
nation's political system was to keep the Communists out of power.

Russian space agency to get dlrs 60 million for research time sale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word `million' in 1st graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian Space Agency expects to
receive dlrs 60 million from NASA within a week for the sale of its
research time on the international space station, an official said
Friday.
	   Russia offered to sell its time so it could finish building the
station's crew compartment, long delayed because of a lack of
funds.
	   The deal was approved by the U.S. Congress on Thursday, said
space agency spokesman Sergei Gorbunov, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Gorbunov has said that Russia will only lose its research time
during the station's assembly in orbit, expected to last four
years, and the deal would not hurt the country's space program.
	   The Russian government owes the space agency dlrs 44.5 million,
which it has promised to pay before the end of the year.
	   Russia's space agency has failed to meet three target dates for
the crew module's launch because of a lack of funds, putting the
whole project more than a year behind schedule.
	   The international space station project involves 16 countries,
including Russia, the United States, Canada and Japan.
	   A cargo module built by the Russian Khrunichev company, under
contract with the U.S. firm Boeing, will be launched on Nov. 20.
NASA will follow in December with the launch of a second part, an
American-built passageway.

German chancellor-elect's top project lurches deeper into trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's key project to fight unemployment lurched deeper into
trouble Friday with industry questioning whether job creation talks
could succeed in a climate of increasing union demands.
	   Three industry leaders said the demands for higher wages,
coupled with the incoming government's tax reform plans, threaten
chances that roundtable talks with unions, business leaders and
politicians envisioned by Schroeder would actually create jobs.
	   ``What can the jobs alliance produce if these kinds of wage
demands are made and at the same time, necessary reforms to taxes
and duties are cut back,'' Hans-Peter Stihl, the president of a key
employer's association, was quoted by Bild as saying. Another key
trade association said it agreed with Stihl.
	   If the incoming government's tax and social policies continued,
Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the German Federation of Industry, said,
``then we cannot extend our hand to the jobs alliance.''
	   He said the incoming government's tax reform puts too great a
burden on medium-sized companies.
	   IG Metall, Germany's biggest union, earlier this week called for
a 6.5 percent wage increase next year for its 2.8 million members.
	   Three other major unions subsequently made similar calls, saying
it was time employees shared the profits from Germany's economic
growth after years of modest wage increases.
	   Bosses are fearful unions have become emboldened by the election
of the center-left government after 16 years of rule by a
conservative coalition.
	   The country's chronic high joblessness was one of the main
reason for the defeat of the conservative coalition government of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

	   Hughes, whose most recent book is ``Birthday Letters,'' a volume
of poems chronicling his courtship and marriage to the American
poet Sylvia Plath, was invested with the insignia of a member of
the Order of Merit.
	   The Order of Merit, founded in 1902 by King Edward VII, is
awarded by the sovereign as a personal gift to individuals of
exceptional distinction.
	   Membership is limited to the sovereign and 24 other people, as
well as additional honorary foreign members.
	   Current members include former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
opera star Dame Joan Sutherland and the actor Sir John Gielgud.
South Africa's President Nelson Mandela is an honorary member.
	   Hughes, 68, has been poet laureate since 1984 and has composed
works for the queen's 60th birthday and Queen Mother Elizabeth's
90th birthday.
	   The poems he has written for royal occasions are collected in a
volume called ``Rain-Charm for the Duchy and other Laureate
Poems.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia took another step Friday
toward restoring peace to Kosovo, signing an agreement to let 2,000
international ``verifiers'' provide first-hand reports whether
Slobodan Milosevic is honoring the deal to end the crisis.
	   The deal was signed with the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe as NATO envoys were meeting in Brussels,
Belgium to decide whether to extend the deadline for the Yugoslav
president to comply with the Kosovo agreement or risk airstrikes.
	   NATO had set a deadline of early Saturday for Milosevic to
withdraw special troops sent to Kosovo to crush ethnic Albanian
rebels, allow the 300,000 refugees to return home and begin talks
on the future of the province.
	   Under the agreement signed Friday, 2,000 unarmed monitors will
be allowed to roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn the
additional troops and to reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it
is safe to return home.
	   ``This is only the first step,'' OSCE chairman Bronislaw
Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said after signing the
agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Geremek said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the
unarmed force and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he
had received promises from member countries for about 800
volunteers, although he did not say how long it would take to
train, equip and station them in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with the main ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, Geremek said in Pristina that ``I am very pleased that my
message about this agreement (on ending the Kosovo conflict) ...
was so well received by Mr. Rugova.
	   ``I have received assurances from Mr Rugova about his
participation in the peace process.''
	   Asked whether the Kosovo Liberation Army would support the
agreement, Rugova said:
	   ``I believe that we can assure that everybody will take part in
this agreement and cooperate with the OSCE mission. The people of
Kosovo are interested in an international presence that will
protect them. So is the KLA, which gave full respect'' to the
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.

Gerry Francis returns to Loftus Road
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four years after quitting the club, former England
captain Gerry Francis returned as manager of Queens Park Rangers
Friday.
	   Francis, who helped the Loftus Road club to a fifth-place finish
in the Premier League in 1993, returns with Rangers next-to-last in
division one after a disastrous slump. He replaces Ray Harford who
quit last month.
	   Francis, who captained England nine times but was restricted by
injury to only 12 international appearances, has been associated
with Rangers for 17 years either as a player or a manager.
	   He was manager from 1991-94 when he quit in a dispute with the
owners over the appointment of former star striker Rodney Marsh as
chief executive, who has since left.
	   Francis became manager of Tottenham but quit after the club went
close to relegation last season.

Rights groups demand Morocco give full accounting of prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Human rights groups on Friday demanded that Morocco
``shed complete light'' on the fate of political prisoners who went
missing years ago.
	   At a Paris news conference, both French and Moroccan rights
groups acknowledged the progress made this week when the Rabat
government acknowledged for the first time that 56 political
prisoners missing since the 1960s were dead.
	   The government also freed 28 prisoners this week, after they
were pardoned by King Hassan II.
	   Hassan has in recent years loosened his grip on the government
and sought to liberalize the country. He said last week he wanted
remaining human rights cases settled within six months.
	   Family members and rights groups say there are more political
prisoners still in jail, and others who may have died.
	   They also want to know the circumstances under which those now
known dead perished, and where they are buried. And they want an
independent investigation of all the cases, carried out by a
non-governmental commission.
	   ``It's a scandal,'' said Radija Rouissi, whose brother,
Abdelhak, disappeared in 1964, and hasn't been heard from since.
	   ``They don't even tell us under what conditions they were
killed. And where are the graves?''
	   Hassan has set up an official council on human rights to deal
with the issue.
	   Patrick Baudouin, head of the Paris-based International
Federation of Human Rights, demanded that the government ``shed
complete light on this issue.
	   ``We are not at the end of the road,'' he said. ``The case of
the disappeared prisoners is not limited to 56 people.'' He said
that in one secret detention center alone, more than 73 political
prisoners were kept.
	   ``There's been a beginning _ when will there be a follow-up?''
asked Abdelaziz Bennani, head of the Moroccan Organization of Human
Rights.
	   For years, Morocco was known to maintain secret detention
centers in Rabat and Casablanca, as well as an internment camp in
the south. Most of those detained were leftists, though many
members of the military were arrested after a foiled coup in 1972.

Rebel leader claims he is victim, not perpetrator of crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Denying charges of treason and
related crimes, the notorious rebel leader Foday Sankoh erupted
emotionally in court Friday, complaining he was the victim of a
global plot to destroy his rebel movement.
	   Sankoh, the enigmatic leader of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front, faces charges in a High Court of crimes against humanity and
other charges linked to Sierra Leone's seven-year civil war and the
bloody May 1997 coup. He has been unable to find a lawyer to defend
him.
	   ``I am innocent and did no wrong. I am a victim of an internal
and international political conspiracy to get rid of me and to
destroy the RUF movement of which I am leader,'' Sankoh told the
crowded courtroom.
	   Sankoh, who was detained in Nigeria in February 1997 about two
months before the coup, said he had been held without charge until
he was returned to his homeland in chains in July.
	   Neither, he said, had a warrant been issued for his arrest.
	   The rebel leader, who was dressed in a green safari suit, ranged
from angry to upset to calm as he launched his defense.
	   Sankoh's rebel movement allied with mutinous military troops
ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah from power on May 25, 1997. The
junta was toppled early this year by West African intervention
troops and Kabbah's elected government returned to power.
	   Since the fall of the junta, rebels and ousted coup soldiers
have waged an intensifying war of terror against civilians.
	   Rebels continue to battle loyalist forces in the interior and
have been accused of a scorched earth revenge campaign on Sankoh's
behalf. Human rights groups and aid workers say thousands of people
have been killed, tortured or disfigured.
	   If found guilty, Sankoh faces execution. At least 34 military
officers and more than a dozen civilians have been condemned to
death in connection with last year's coup.

Russian hot water pipe eruption scalds children, others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Emergency officials worked Friday
to repair hot water pipes that burst in suburbs north of St.
Petersburg and scalded several people, including three children
hospitalized with serious burns.
	   Water as hot as 140 degrees C (284 degrees F) burst from pipes
in 30 locations across the Vyborgsky region Thursday, according to
Emergencies Ministry spokesman Andrei Alyabyev.
	   At least 294 apartments were still without heat or hot water
Friday, a chilly fall day.
	   The pipes exploded during tests usually done before winter to
make sure they can withstand high levels of water pressure, but
many of the pipes are old and do not always survive the tests,
Alyabyev said.
	   Misha Lonchenko, 14, suffered burns over 80 percent of his body
and was in critical condition Friday in an intensive care unit at
St. Petersburg Children's Hospital No. 1, the Interfax news agency
quoted doctors as saying.
	   Ten-year-old Vladislav Artyemyev and 14-year-old Dmitry Ivanov
also suffered burns and were at the same hospital.
	   Gennady Artyemyev, 59, Nikolai Guselyev and Mikhail Vasilyev,
whose ages were unavailable, were taken to the Petersburg Military
Hospital with burns.
	   Later another man was injured when he walked through a
sealed-off intersection to take a short cut and fell into boiling
water there, the ministry said.

World watches as newest nuclear powers begin talks

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Talks between Pakistan and India, the
world's newest nuclear powers, focused Friday on ``peace and
security'' to prevent a decades-long dispute over the Kashmir
region from boiling over into a more serious conflict.
	   The discussions brought the two countries' foreign secretaries
together for the first time since their nations conducted
underground nuclear tests in May that drew condemnation and
sanctions from the world.
	   In brief comments after a four-hour meeting, Pakistani Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said ``we are still in the middle of our
discussions ... we cannot be expected to produce results,'' on the
first day.
	   The talks continue until Sunday, when the two foreign
secretaries are expected to issue a joint statement.
	   They mark the first time that Pakistan and India have openly
discussed their nuclear programs _ in the development stage since
1974 when New Delhi first exploded a nuclear device.
	   Both Pakistan and India possess missiles capable of carrying
single and multiple nuclear warheads.
	   ``After the nuclearization of South Asia both countries are
facing new challenges not just to avert a nuclear confrontation . .
. (but) to prevent an arms race,'' Shamshad said earlier today.
	   The May tests brought global condemnation and fears of a
possible nuclear war on the volatile subcontinent, where Pakistan
and India are locked in a 51-year dispute over Himalayan state of
Kashmir.
	   Both countries lay claim to the state, which was divided between
them when British colonial rule ended in South Asia in 1947. They
have gone to war twice over Kashmir and a third time over
Bangladesh, then called East Pakistan.
	   A guerrilla war raging on India's side of the disputed Kashmir
border brought the two neighbors close to a fourth confrontation in
1990.
	   The talks focus on Kashmir but neither side appears to have
changed its position.
	   Pakistan wants Kashmiris on both sides of the disputed border to
vote on whether to join Islamic Pakistan or mostly Hindu India.
Pakistan also wants international mediation to settle the
protracted dispute.
	   India has rejected both suggestions.
	   Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's former ambassador to Washington, said
Pakistan cannot agree to a no-first use pact on nuclear weapons
because India has enough conventional fire power to knock out
Pakistan's nuclear facilities and command and control centers
without having to resort to its own nuclear arsenal.
	   She said Pakistan would prefer an agreement that neither country
would launch a first strike of any kind, similar to a no-war pact.

20 years after election, pope asks Poles for prayers to keep going

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Marking the 20th anniversary of his election
to the papacy, Pope John Paul II on Friday reminisced sentimentally
with fellow Poles and asked for prayers so he can keep doing God's
work ``right to the end.''
	   ``I thank God for having given me the grace to announce the good
news of salvation to many peoples and many nations on all the
continents, and among them also my compatriots on Polish soil,''
John Paul said, speaking slowly but steadily from an armchair
placed under a canopy on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
	   About 20,000 Poles, many of them journeying overnight on buses
from their homeland, streamed into St. Peter's Square for a Mass in
Polish celebrated by Warsaw Cardinal Jozef Glemp in the pope's
honor.
	   ``I ask you again to pray so that I can carry out right to the
end the work that God entrusted to me, for his glory in the service
of the church and of the world,'' said John Paul, who came out to
greet the crowd in the square after the Mass.
	   At 6:44 p.m., on Oct. 16, 1978, word was delivered in that same
cobblestoned square that Karol Wojtyla, the 58-year-old archbishop
of Krakow, had been chosen to lead the Roman Catholic Church.
	   The announcement that the church had its first non-Italian pope
in 455 years astonished the world and worried authorities in the
Soviet bloc.
	   John Paul used his moral stature to help Poles stay the course
during a Communist military crackdown against the Solidarity free
trade movement in the early 1980s.
	   Glemp told the pope that his visits to Poland helped inspire his
countrymen to win independence from Communism. John Paul plans to
visit Poland next in June.
	   John Paul has charmed crowds since right after he was elected,
when he told the faithful: ``If I make a mistake (in Italian), you
will correct me.''
	   Across the huge square Friday, intimacy was quickly established
between the pope and his fellow Poles as John Paul, one of only a
dozen popes to have lasted at least 20 years in the post, recalled
the trials and triumphs of his papacy.
	   He remembered those who prayed for him ``in the moments of my
suffering and of sickness, and especially on that memorable May 13,
1981,'' when he was shot and gravely wounded in St. Peter's Square.
	   ``It's difficult to speak of that without getting emotional,''
John Paul said.
	   Physically, John Paul today is quite different from the robust,
handsome skiing enthusiast who became pope.
	   As his open-topped ``popemobile'' moved through Friday's crowd,
John Paul gripped a support bar tightly, working hard to keep his
balance. He tried to stem his left hand's tremor by holding on to
an armrest.
	   Following the 1981 shooting, the pope has since been
hospitalized a few times, including for surgery to remove what the
Vatican said was a benign bowel tumor and after he broke his hip in
a fall. John Paul has difficulty walking and climbing stairs.
	   The Vatican has refused to confirm reports that the pope has
Parkinson's disease, whose symptoms include tremors, slurred speech
and a shuffling gait like the pope's.
	   ``He's a historic pope,'' said Elzbieta Kawalczyk, explaining
why she journeyed from Lodz, Poland, for the Mass.
	   ``He's not healthy,'' said Kawalczyk, whose husband, Marek,
quickly added: ``But he's still strong and active.''
	   Among the front-row VIPs was Polish President Aleksander
Krasniewski, whose support for a liberalized abortion bill had
angered the pope. Mrs. Krasniewski knelt before the pope and gave
him a bouquet.

	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ A High Court on Friday
indicted 100 members of Republic of Congo's former government with
a sweeping list of offenses including assassinations, tortures,
rapes, fraud and theft.
	   The list of charges were read by the nation's public prosecutor
Placide Eleka at a press conference in the capital Brazzaville.
	   Among those indicted were the country's ousted former president
Pascal Lissouba, ex-Brazzaville mayor and prime minister Bernard
Kolelas and former finance minister Ngila Moungounga. All are
currently in exile.
	   President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who captured the reins of power
from Lissouba during a bloody five-month civil war last year, has
repeatedly accused his predecessor of genocide during the war in
which about 10,000 people were killed.
	   The civil war broke out in June 1997 after Lissouba tried to
disarm Sassou-Nguesso's private militia, the Cobras, before July
presidential elections that both men planned to contest.
	   The war ended when Angolan troops and tanks entered the
fighting, backing the Cobras, who celebrated their victory with a
looting spree lasting several days.
	   A national forum appointed by the government earlier this year
has named a 75-member National Transition Council to help govern
the country during its transition to civilian rule instead of a
parliament.
	   Sassou-Nguesso earlier ruled a one-party Marxist state from
1979-91, then lost to Lissouba in presidential elections in 1992.
	   Lissouba visited the United States last month to rally support
for a resolution to declare he had been illegally ousted in a coup
_ a step towards pushing for possible sanctions and foreign aid
cuts to Republic of Congo.

Merchants and militiamen agrees to cease fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somali (AP) _ Somali merchants and militiamen worked
out a cease-fire deal which led to the reopening Friday of two main
highways, one of which leads to a port.
	   Gunmen loyal to Osman Ali Atto and Muse Sudi Yalahow had clashed
with merchants Thursday, leaving at least six people were killed
and 10 others wounded.
	   Both men are opposed to a new administration for Mogadishu set
up by their rivals Hussein Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
	   In protest and to get money, Ali Atto, Yalahow and other militia
leaders have set up roadblocks to extort money from merchants
trying to do business between Mogadishu and southern Somalia.
	   After the roads reopened, the natural port of El-Ma'an, 30
kilometers (20 miles) northeast of Mogadishu has resumed
operations.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. The country disintegrated
into fiefdoms protected by militias.
	   In the southern port town of Kismayo, politicians and
businessmen resolved a dispute over the tariff for importing khat,
a popular narcotic leaf.
	   Local faction leaders had demanded 20 percent of the value of
imported khat, but businessmen told journalists they settled for 10
percent.
	   Local leaders also pledged to demolish all illegal roadblocks
within and outside the town to ensure smooth flow of the business
in and around Kismayo.

Japanese prime minister deplores fatal hit-and-run

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The death of an Okinawan teen-ager in a hit-and-run
in which a U.S. Marine is charged has been ``extremely painful''
for the nation, Japan's prime minister said Friday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said he had met with U.S. ambassador
Thomas Foley to discuss the accident and asked U.S. authorities to
do their utmost to prevent the recurrence of such accidents.
	   Yuki Uema, 18, died Wednesday from head injuries, one week after
the accident. Police say U.S. Marine Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge was
driving drunk when he struck Uema's small motorcycle.
	   ``The accident on Okinawa was extremely painful,'' Obuchi said
in a speech marking the closing of a parliamentary session. ``I
pray for Miss Uema from the depth of my heart and offer my
sincerest condolences to her family.''
	   Eskridge, 23, of LaPorte, Indiana, has been charged with
hit-and-run, driving under the influence of alcohol and causing
injury through professional negligence.
	   Eskridge's lawyer, Miyatomi Harushima, suggested his client
would not fight the charges in court, although he declined to say
specifically how he would plead.
	   ``I don't foresee major contests in this case,'' Harushima said
Friday in a telephone interview from Okinawa.
	   Harushima said he was most worried about how Eskridge was coping
in a foreign jail, but it was unclear whether he would be released
on bail.
	   Okinawans have long resented having most of the American troops
in Japan stationed on their tiny island, 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles) southwest of Tokyo. Their outrage erupted after the 1995
rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl, in which three U.S. servicemen
were convicted.
	   Japanese and U.S. officials are eager to prevent the hit-and-run
from flaring up into another catalyst for anger among the residents
of Okinawa against the U.S. military. Washington sees its forces in
Okinawa as a key to Pacific security, and Japan wants to keep them
there.
	   Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota on Friday urged the Tokyo central
government to consider reworking a 1995 U.S.-Japan agreement on
handing over American servicemen suspected of crimes in Japan,
Kyodo News service reported.
	   The agreement says that servicemen suspected of ``heinous
crimes,'' such as rape and murder, can be handed over even before
they are officially charged.
	   The Japanese government did not demand Eskridge's handover
before he was charged, but the Okinawan government wanted the
earlier handover.
	   The Marines say they followed due process and the hit-and-run is
not a heinous crime, as defined by the agreement.
	   Uema's funeral services were held Friday. Lt. Gen. Frank
Libutti, commander of Marine Corps bases in Japan, attended. Foley
has expressed his condolences to the Uema family.
	   The date for Eskridge's trial has not yet been set.
	   Under Japanese law, a conviction on injuring someone while
driving carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison or
a 500,000 yen (dlrs 4,300) fine.

Fugitive financier extradited to Italy from France

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The fugitive financier who ran a shadowy Masonic
lodge that played a key role in one of Italy's biggest postwar
scandals came home under police escort Friday to face a 12-year
prison sentence after being extradited by France.
	   Licio Gelli, 79, fled Italy in May just as he was to begin
serving the sentence for bank fraud. He was arrested on the French
Riviera in September.
	   Because of his poor health, Gelli agreed on Oct. 7 not to fight
extradition, but his departure was delayed by his heart problems.
He had been hospitalized at the Sainte-Marguerite hospital in
Marseille.
	   A fleet of police cars and at least two doctors met Gelli's
plane when it landed in Rome Friday afternoon, the ANSA news agency
said. The agency said Gelli would be taken to a prison hospital in
Tuscany.
	   In his heyday, Gelli was once one of Italy's biggest influence
peddlers and the head of a the powerful, secretive Masonic lodge
P-2, or Propaganda 2. The lodge was exposed in the 1980s and
accused of plotting to install a right-wing dictatorship in Italy.
	   He was convicted in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, then
Italy's largest bank. The collapse touched off a huge financial
scandal for the Vatican because the Vatican Bank owned part of
Ambrosiano.
	   Gelli's May escape was not his first. He bribed his way out of a
Swiss prison in 1983, a year after his arrest in connection with an
investigation of P-2. He surrendered in Geneva four years later,
and was extradited to Italy in 1988.
	   After he fled the last time, police found millions of dollars in
gold bars and cash in his villa in Tuscany, fueling rumors that
Gelli had amassed a fortune during his years as a Fascist
functionary in World War II.

Parliament rejects motion seeking to oust Speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's Parliament speaker, accused of
siding with his party in house proceedings, Friday survived a bid
by the main opposition party to remove him from his position.
	   In a parliamentary vote, the opposition Communist Party of
Nepal-United Marxist Leninnist, supported by a faction of the
National Democratic Party and smaller parties managed to garner
only 55 votes in favor of Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel's ouster.
	   House officials said 123 votes were cast against the motion.
Nepal's constitution requires two-third votes in the 205-seat House
of Representatives to force the speaker out of office.
	   The motion against Poudel was rejected by his Nepali Congress
party and its partner in the government, the Communist Party of
Nepal-Marxist Leninist.
	   The opposition had accused the speaker and the government of
conspiring to push through a bill giving more power to local
governments.

Survey: Public support for non-alignment softens in Sweden,
</HEADLINE>
Finland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Public support in Sweden and Finland
for military non-alignment seems to have weakened since the end of
the Cold War nearly a decade ago.
	   A survey commissioned by the U.S. government and released Friday
indicated only 26 percent of Swedes, and 32 percent of Finns, felt
non-alignment was their best defense in today's world.
	   The majority favored security pacts with NATO or their European
neighbors.
	   The survey, which included Austria, indicated 55 of every 100
Swedes would ``strongly'' or ``somewhat'' support the country's
membership in NATO. That compared to 50 percent of Finns and 38
percent of Austrians. None are NATO members now.
	   Sweden has not fought a war since 1815 and neutrality has been a
hallmark of its military policy. In contrast, among the Nordic
countries, Norway is a founding member of NATO, and Denmark is also
a member. Both nations were occupied by Germany during World War
ll.
	   In recent years all three countries in the survey participated
in NATO's ``Partnership for Peace'' exercises, and expressed
interest in wider cooperation.
	   In Sweden, the biggest political support for joining NATO came
from adherents of the out-of-power, non-socialist parties.
	   More than eight of every 10 survey participants across the three
countries said they would not support higher national defense
spending. And support for NATO membership dipped when the
obligation for defending a neighbor was explained.
	   During ``a time of crisis,'' Austrians indicated they would rely
most on Germans, Finns on Swedes, and Swedes on the United States.
Among institutions, the three countries had the most confidence in
the United Nations to solve problems and to a lesser extent, the
European Union.
	   The survey was commissioned ``to gauge European public opinion
on a number of security issues that are vital to the United
States,'' according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy.
	   The survey was based on 3,019 telephone interviews with
participants age 18 and older. The Sweden one was handled by the
Gallup organization. The stated margin of error was four percent in
either direction.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia took another step Friday
to restore peace in the Kosovo province, signing an agreement to
let 2,000 international ``verifiers'' provide first-hand reports
whether Slobodan Milosevic is honoring the deal to end the crisis.
	   The deal was signed with the 54-nation Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe as NATO envoys in met in Brussels,
Belgium, to decide whether to extend the deadline for the Yugoslav
president to comply with the agreement or risk airstrikes.
	   NATO had set a deadline of early Saturday for Milosevic to
withdraw special troops sent to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, allow
the 300,000 refugees to return home and begin talks on the future
of the southern province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown in February to crush the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army, The KLA has killed more than 200 Serb policemen,
Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal to Milosevic's
government.
	   Under the agreement signed Friday, 2,000 unarmed monitors will
roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn the additional
troops and to reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it is safe to
return home.
	   ``This is only the first step,'' OSCE chairman Bronislaw
Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said after signing the
agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Geremek said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the
unarmed force and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he
had received promises from member countries for about 800
volunteers, although he did not say how long it would take to
train, equip and station them in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with the main ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina, Geremek said, ``I have
received assurances from Mr Rugova about his participation in the
peace process.''
	   Rugova said he believed KLA rebels would support the agreement,
and cooperate with the OSCE mission.
	   ``The people of Kosovo are interested in an international
presence that will protect them,'' said Rugova. ``So is the KLA,
which gave full respect'' to the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer
Mission.
	   In the meantime, NATO spy planes will begin flying over
Yugoslavia shortly under an agreement signed late Thursday by
NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and
Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   NATO sources, speaking Friday in Brussels, said U2 spy planes
may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this weekend. Jetfighters
could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy planes are
threatened, the sources added on condition of anonymity.
	   That will help the Alliance determine Milosevic's compliance
even before the monitors start their work on the ground.
	   Despite those measures, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said Thursday in Belgrade that Milosevic had a long way to go to
meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, and most of them favor independence or substantial
self-rule. The United States has been spearheading international
efforts to revive negotiations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose the militants'
demand for independence, fearing this could lead to further
instability among ethnic Albanian communities throughout the
southern Balkans.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a six-truck aid convoy to Djakovica
near the Albanian border on Friday and were stepping up aid
efforts, spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. She said workers
had observed a continuing widespread fear of Serb forces,
preventing any full flow of refugees back to their charred homes.
	   Also Friday, the head of the first U.S. government team of aid
workers to go to Kosovo since the agreement was leaving for the
Serbian province. Roy Williams, disaster relief coordinator for the
U.S. Agency for International Development, said he expects the new
``unfettered access'' will speed distribution of aid.
	   He said there is enough food and other supplies to sustain the
scattered population during the winter if they can return to their
homes, but meeting medical needs will be a difficult challenge.

Davenport beats Coetzer, reaches semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with later matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Playing like the world's No. 1
player, American Lindsay Davenport annihilated sixth-seed Amanda
Coetzer Friday at the European Championships, booking a place in
the semifinals.
	   Living up to her new ranking, the 22-year-old defending champion
breezed past the world No.13, dispatching Coetzer 6-3, 6-1 in just
58 minutes for her seventh straight victory over the South African.
	   But while her win over Coetzer was speedy and imperious,
Davenport admitted feeling a certain amount of pressure resulting
from her new status.
	   ``There's pressure to defend the points, to defend the title,
and to try not to let the lead go,'' said Davenport, who officially
took over as the world's top player from Martina Hingis on Monday.
``Hopefully you don't put too much pressure on yourself and say
`you've got to win the tournament now that you're one.'
	   ``You mustn't think `I'm No.1, I've got to win,' or `I can't
lose to this person, I'm No.1,' because it would all fall apart,''
the U.S. Open champion reasoned. ``Inevitably now when I lose, I'll
lose to someone ranked below me.''
	   But there was little sign that Davenport's new status was
rattling her Friday. In fact, it was Coetzer who appeared to
crumble, holding serve just once in the entire match.
	   Getting off to a forceful start, Davenport took the South
African's first two serves to jump to a 3-0 lead.
	   But taking advantage of a dip in Davenport's focus, a scrappy
Coetzer rallied to break back twice and even the score.
	   The comeback seemed to rekindle Davenport's zeal, the American
winning the next three games to take the set.
	   Davenport continued her domination in the second set, winning
the first four games before Coetzer was able to break the American
once to somewhat narrow the gap.
	   Coetzer's defiance was short-lived, however, as Davenport broke
right back, winning the next two games to wrap up the match.
	   ``I lost my concentration and missed a few easy balls,'' said
Davenport, who has dropped just one set in her last seven matches
against Coetzer. ``But once I won that next game and went up
another break that was the turning point.
	   ``I probably shouldn't have let it get to that point, but for
the rest I played pretty well.''
	   The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning streak in
Switzerland to 14 victories.
	   Her run began at the 1993 European Open in Lucerne, where she
captured her first career title at the age of 16. Davenport went on
to defend that title in 1994 before winning in Zurich last year.
	   The winner of five titles this season, Davenport will meet Irina
Spirlea in the semifinals, the Romanian trampling eighth-seed
Dominique Van Roost 6-4, 6-0 in her quarterfinal.
	   Spirlea needed just 53 minutes to cruise past the Belgian, who
ended Martina Hingis's reign atop the world rankings when she upset
the Swiss star in the quarterfinals of Filderstadt last week.
	   In later quarterfinal matches, American Venus Williams, seeded
second, took on seventh-seed Mary Pierce, and fourth-seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France met Austria's Barbara Schett.

Star of `Titanic' announces engagement

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Titanic'' star Kate Winslet plans to marry her
boyfriend, aspiring film director Jim Theapleton, next year, the
couple announced Friday.
	   ``When you know it's the right thing, you just know,'' Ms.
Winslet said, posing for photographers outside the couple's north
London home. ``We want to get married sometime next summer, but we
want to keep the details a secret.''
	   Ms. Winslet, 23, and Theapleton, 24, met last year on the set of
the upcoming British film ``Hideous Kinky,'' where he was working
as an assistant director.
	   ``When you know, you know _ that's what I have been told all my
life _ and now I know,'' Ms. Winslet said. ``I knew instantly. I
thought, `Yep, I'll have that.' ''

Forecast: Russia may be headed for meat, butter shortages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts and UPDATES with oil industry losses, new ruble
rate. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russians already facing the lowest grain harvest
in decades may also be short of meat, vegetable oil and butter _
staples of their diet _ by the start of the year, a private
agriculture group forecast Friday.
	   The winter is looking similarly bleak for Russia's oil industry:
It has lost dlrs 10 billion over the past year, largely because of
the drop in world oil prices, a lawmaker said. Oil is Russia's
largest source of foreign currency income.
	   Basic foods have remained available despite the economic crisis
that hit Russia in mid-August, and the government insists it
doesn't expect any shortages.
	   Still, a sharp drop in food imports and a low harvest have
prompted serious concerns. The government has created an emergency
food reserve and approached the United States for grain and other
food on long-term credit and as humanitarian aid.
	   Meat, butter and vegetable oil shortages may hit by the start of
next year, according to the Russia's Institute for Agrarian Market
Trends, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   That would deal a blow to virtually all Russian kitchens, and
would be the first such shortages since the early 1990s.
	   The institute, headed by former Agriculture Minister Viktor
Khlystun, said it is unclear whether Russian producers can fill the
gap left by falling imports, although the government has said it
would lower import duties on basic foods to stem losses.
	   Meanwhile, the oil industry has suffered dlrs 10 billion in
losses since oil prices started diving last year, Alexander
Lotarev, a member of parliament's natural resources committee, said
Friday.
	   He blamed Russia's financial problems, complicated tax laws and
corruption for adding to the losses, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Alexander Lebed, former Russian security chief and now governor
of the vast Krasnoyarsk region, said Friday that Russia may not be
able to pay off its foreign debts next month, when a 90-day
moratorium on payment expires. The moratorium was declared Aug. 17,
the same day Russia devalued the ruble, two moves that precipitated
the current crisis.
	   ``Very big trouble is going to begin on Nov. 18,'' said Lebed,
who has a penchant for making alarmist predictions. ``If we speak
of the worst option, it would be the country's bankruptcy.''
	   Russian negotiators held two days of talks on restructuring the
debts with Western bank creditors in London this week but failed to
reach an agreement.
	   The government hasn't spelled out how it will pull Russia out of
the crisis, insisting that its plan will depend on whether the
International Monetary Fund provides more aid.
	   A tentative program will be presented to an IMF delegation
arriving in Moscow on Tuesday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov
said.
	   In other economic news Friday:
	   _ The ruble fell to 17.1 against the dollar, from 16.2 on
Thursday.
	   _ Russia's money supply grew 5.2 percent last week to 183.9
billion rubles (dlrs 11.86 million), the Central Bank said Friday.
The money includes billions of rubles that were freed through
lowering minimum reserve requirements. Russia also printed about 1
billion rubles in September.
	   _ Foreign trade turnover shrank 7 percent in the first eight
months of this year compared to the same period in 1997, falling to
dlrs 81. 6 billion.
	   _ Retail gasoline prices shot up 10 percent this week in and
around Moscow, Interfax said.

Gergia and Abkhazia kick-off peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Georgia and the breakaway Abkhazia region
began U.N.-sponsored peace talks here Friday in the hope of ending
their six-year dispute.
	   ``This is the largest and most representative meeting of the
Georgian and Abkhaz sides since the end of the war,'' said Liviv
Bota, a special representative of U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
	   Both sides hope the three-day talks will help resolve a crisis
that erupted in Abkhazia, located in western Georgia, after
Georgian troops assaulted the region in August 1992.
	   The Abkhazians pushed the Georgians out of their fertile Black
Sea republic in the fall of 1993. A shaky truce is monitored by
about 3,000 Russian peacekeepers and 150 United Nations observers.
	   Georgia is being represented by State Minister Vazha
Lordkipandidze and Abkhzia by its acting Prime Minister Sergei
Bagapsh.
	   Russia, which is pushing for a solution, said the meeting could
generate an agreement for confidence building measures to help
create an atmosphere of security that will help develop economic
ties and pave the way for humanitarian assistance to both sides.
	   `` This is badly needed and indispensable work,'' said Lev
Mironov, a Russian envoy to the meeting.
	   Lordkipandidze agreed that ``it would be useful to discuss
during our meeting questions regarding an immediate beginning of
the return of the refugees ... problems linked to security in the
conflict zone.''
	   With sporadic violence marring an agreement signed last month to
stabilize the region, Bagapsh also expressed the hope progress
could be achieved.
	   ``When so many people are dealing with such a meeting it
probably would be wrong not to reach agreement at it,'' Bagapsh.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
agreed on the foreign policy guidelines of a new center-left
coalition Friday, clearing a major hurdle in their negotiations.
	   The dominant Social Democrats stressed that the accord pledges
continuity in essential areas, such as firm German support for
NATO, European integration and partnership with the United States.
	   Both parties also agreed that foreign missions for German
soldiers should be covered by international law, a reference to a
United Nations mandate.
	   The accord signaled a coming of age for the Greens, a party with
pacifist leanings rooted in the 1980s European peace movement.
Radical demands in their election platform, such as a call for
eventually disbanding NATO, were thwarted by the Social Democrats.
	   Both sides said the talks had gone unexpectedly smoothly.
	   ``We knew from the start that we would not be able to cancel the
reigning logic in foreign policy,'' said Ludger Volmer, the leading
Greens left-winger.
	   Hours earlier, he abstained in a vote by the outgoing parliament
on sending German warplanes into any NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia if it fails to comply with this week's peace accord on
Kosovo. Most Greens and Social Democrats supported the measure,
which passed by a vote of 500-62.
	   With the coalition deal, Volmer said he expected that such
conflict would not resurface during the new government's four-year
term because both parties are calling for more emphasis on
preventive diplomacy.
	   A Greens demand for abolishing compulsory military service was
referred to a commission that will debate army reforms.
	   Both sides also said they would spend more on aid for
international development to help conflicts from breaking out in
poorer countries.
	   After the announcement, both parties went into talks on energy
taxes amid reports that they may raise government borrowing to fill
budget gaps.

 &UR; Aide to Russian parliament speaker wounded by gunman &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of shooting, Osherov in critical
condition. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ An aide to the speaker of Russia's
lower house of parliament was shot in the head by an unidentified
gunman outside his apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday,
Russian news agencies reported.
	   Mikhail Osherov, aide to Gennady Seleznyov, the speaker of the
State Duma, was in critical condition and was undergoing surgery,
said Igor Yakovenko, chief doctor at the Polyenov Neurosurgery
Clinic.
	   Osherov was hit by a single bullet at midday while he was
walking into his building, said Tatiana Vasilyeva, press spokesman
at the St. Petersburg's prosecutor's office,
	   The attacker left behind a gun with a silencer, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Seleznyov was expected to arrive in St. Petersburg later Friday
for a meeting with lawmakers from former Soviet republics. He was
also expected to attend the funeral of Dmitry Filippov, a prominent
St. Petersburg businessman who died earlier in the week from
injuries sustained in a bomb explosion.
	   Many Russian businessmen acquired credentials as legislative
aides in hopes that would help advance their business interests,
and many have fallen victim to contract murders.
	   There was no immediate word on whether Osherov had any business
connections.
	   Seleznyov spokesman Mikhail Belyat said he did not rule out a
political motive behind the attack, adding that Osherov was
expected to work as Seleznyov's campaign aide for the 1999
parliamentary elections, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Latin American leaders consider their economic woes at summit

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders flew Friday to
Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield
their economies from the global financial crisis.
	   Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in
recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's
developing economies.
	   An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the
turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue
facing the world at the moment.
	   ``I don't know if we are coming to the end of the world economic
order. It will be interesting to know,'' the Cuban leader said at a
hotel press conference shortly after his arrival for the annual
Ibero-American summit.
	   Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said President
Clinton was aware that ``if South America falls into crisis, it
will be extended inevitably also to the United States,'' which is
heavily involved in investments and loans in the region.
	   Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America
with devastating effects on stock markets and currency reserves.
	   The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and
Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial turmoil
that already has devastated Asia and Russia. Stock markets also
fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in Latin America.
	   The Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular
reforms of their public finances, including austerity packages
which risk social unrest and political upheaval.
	   A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port
city on the Douro River in northern Portugal.
	   Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final
statement.
	   The declaration ``calls on the international community, and
Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary
measures to promote stability in international financial markets,
which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,''
said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
	   Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory
system for global financial transactions that would place controls
on speculators, like measures to slow down the internatioal flow of
money.
	   They also want reforms that allow international financial
institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with
rescue packages.
	   ``International institutions must be active in tackling crises
like the recent one ... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said.
	   ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in
reference to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their
economies.
	   Brazil, the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark
against creeping recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30
billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
	   The presidents of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development
Bank also were expected at the talks.
	   The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates
Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, but analysts
expected the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns
about the continent's economic health.
	   The recent economic troubles stemmed in part from the structural
weaknesses of Latin American economies.
	   A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a
government austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that
could arise if tough reforms are introduced.
	   Brazil is drafting an austerity package that will hit public
spending, especially social security.

UCI says it won't push for disciplinary action against Jalabert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Cycling's world governing body said
Friday it won't pursue disciplinary action against French rider
Laurent Jalabert after he apologized for comparing top officials to
neo-Nazis.
	   During last month's Vuelta a Espana, Jalabert described the
International Cycling Union (UCI) as a ``dictatorship'' and its
commissioners as ``half Dracula and half neo-Nazi.''
	   UCI president Hein Verbruggen said Jalabert must apologize or be
excluded from the World Championships earlier this month.
	   Jalabert, the world's top-ranked cyclist, later pulled out of
the worlds, citing physical and psychological fatigue. He said his
withdrawal was unrelated to the UCI threat.
	   The UCI said in a statement that its commissioners have dropped
demands for action against Jalabert after receiving a letter from
the rider dated Sept. 29 in which he ``formally regrets'' the
incident.
	   The solution ``demonstrates the will of the parties concerned to
calm certain tensions that exist,'' it said.
	   Although accepting Jalabert's apology, the UCI added that it
``invites all riders to consider in future the content and form of
what they say to the press to avoid such situations recurring.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted Friday to
select three judges to fill a new trial chamber of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, whose caseload could grow with atrocities
committed during the Kosovo conflict.
	   Representatives of the 185-member assembly cast secret ballots,
choosing among nine candidates nominated by their home countries.
The three will rule on cases concerning crimes committed in the
former Yugoslavia. Their terms will end Nov. 16, 2001.
	   None of the original nine candidates emerged from the first
round of balloting with the 94 `yes' votes needed for a majority,
meaning a second round was required. Poland and Ecuador withdrew
their candidates for the second round, narrowing the field down to
seven.
	   The remaining candidates were Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco, David
Anthony Hunt of Australia, Per-Johan Viktor Lindholm of Finland,
Hugo Anibal Llanos Mansilla of Chile, Patrick Lipton Robinson of
Jamaica, Waldo Bandara Srinihal Wadugodapitiya of Sri Lanka and
Peter H. Wilkitzki of Germany.

Ukraine's GDP falls after growing for months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's gross domestic product fell
sharply in September, contributing to its overall decrease in the
first nine months of 1998 compared to the same period last year,
officials said Friday.
	   The country's GDP in January through September was 0.5 percent
lower than in the same period last year after contracting by 5
percent in September alone, the State Statistics Committee
reported.
	   The reduction followed a slight but steady increase in GDP this
year, which signaled the former Soviet republic's first economic
growth since 1989.
	   However, Ukraine was badly hit by the economic crisis in
neighboring Russia last month, and the country's economy is
expected to shrink again this year.

Uruguayan writer hopes Planeta prize will add weight to her image
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The winner of Spain's prestigious Planeta
literary prize, Uruguayan writer Carmen Posadas, said Friday she
believed herself to be ``the anti-cliche of a writer.''
	   Posadas, 44, told reporters she hoped that winning the 50
million peseta (dlrs 350,000) prize for her novel `Pequenas
Infamias' (Minor Disgraces) would draw public attention to her
work.
	   Posadas admitted that her sometimes frivolous image had damaged
her credibility as a writer, although it was ``very useful for
selling perfume or running a boutique,'' the national news agency
EFE quoted her as saying.
	   Born in Montevideo, Posadas gained notoriety in Spain through
her mocking of Madrid's jet set during the 1980s economic boom in
television programs and in her books. She is married to Mariano
Rubio _ former government of Spain's central bank who fell from
grace in 1994 amid an insider dealing scandal.
	   She presented Pequenas Infamias _ which begins with the
discovery of a dead body in the fridge at a jet setters party _
under a pseudonym.
	   ``The text can be read as a novel of intrigue but other readings
are possible,'' Spain's leading daily El Pais quoted the writer as
saying.
	   Posadas began by writing children's books. Her best known book
for an adult audience was ``Cinco Moscas Azules,'' (Five
Bluebottles).
	   He new novel is due out in early November.

Davenport beats Coetzer, reaches semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with later matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Lindsay Davenport displayed
the form which earned her the No. 1 ranking on the WTA Tour earlier
this week, taking only 58 minute to rout 13th-ranked Amanda Coetzer
6-3, 6-1 Friday and reach the semifinals of the European
Championships.
	   It was Davenport's seventh straight victory over the South
African, but the American said she was feeling a little extra
pressure resulting from her new status.
	   ``There's pressure to defend the points, to defend the title,
and to try not to let the lead go,'' said Davenport, who officially
passed Martina Hingis as No. 1 on Monday. ``Hopefully you don't put
too much pressure on yourself and say `you've got to win the
tournament now that you're one.'
	   ``You mustn't think `I'm No. 1, I've got to win,' or `I can't
lose to this person, I'm No. 1,' because it would all fall apart,''
the U.S. Open champion said. ``Inevitably now when I lose, I'll
lose to someone ranked below me.''
	   There was little sign that Davenport's new status was rattling
her Friday. In fact, it was Coetzer who appeared to crumble,
holding serve just once in the entire match.
	   Getting off to a forceful start, Davenport broke the South
African teice to jump to a 3-0 lead.
	   But taking advantage of a dip in Davenport's focus, a scrappy
Coetzer rallied to break back twice and even the score.
	   The comeback seemed to rekindle Davenport's zeal, the American
winning the next three games to take the set.
	   Davenport continued her domination in the second set, winning
the first four games before Coetzer was able to break the American
once to somewhat narrow the gap.
	   Coetzer's defiance was short-lived, however, as Davenport broke
right back, winning the next two games to wrap up the match.
	   ``I lost my concentration and missed a few easy balls,'' said
Davenport, who has lost just one set in her last seven matches
against Coetzer. ``But once I won that next game and went up
another break that was the turning point.
	   ``I probably shouldn't have let it get to that point, but for
the rest I played pretty well.''
	   The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning streak in
Switzerland to 14 victories.
	   Her run began at the 1993 European Open in Lucerne, where she
captured her first career title at the age of 16. Davenport went on
to defend that title in 1994 before winning in Zurich last year.
	   The winner of five titles this season, Davenport will meet Irina
Spirlea in the semifinals, the Romanian trampling eighth-seed
Dominique Van Roost 6-4, 6-0 in her quarterfinal.
	   Spirlea needed just 53 minutes to cruise past the Belgian, who
ended Martina Hingis's reign atop the world rankings when she upset
the Swiss star in the quarterfinals of Filderstadt last week.
	   In later quarterfinal matches, American Venus Williams, seeded
second, took on seventh-seed Mary Pierce, and fourth-seed Nathalie
Tauziat of France met Austria's Barbara Schett.

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Fiscal police are investigating
Dutch soccer's league leader, Feyenoord Rotterdam, for suspected
tax evasion and fraud involving millions of guilders (dollars), a
spokeswoman said Friday.
	   Tax authorities seized the club's accounting books Tuesday and
conducted searches of other offices, said Carola de Kimpe of the
Rotterdam Public Prosecutor's office.
	   Authorities also questioned club chairman, businessman Jorien
van den Herik. No arrests have been made.
	   De Kimpe said the tax offenses are believed to have happened ``a
few years ago.''
	   In an initial reaction, the club described the investigation as
``a difference of opinion'' between it and tax authorities.
	   The dispute is over the payment of taxes on transfer fees paid
by the club for foreign stars.

Russian woman gives birth to 18th child
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hardest thing for Yelena Shishkina about
giving birth to yet another child _ her 18th _ may be choosing a
name.
	   Shishkina, 42, and her husband Alexander already have a Sasha,
Sveta, Vasya, Pasha, Anya, Denis, Valya, Seryozha, Olya, Lyosha,
Natasha, Zhenya, Tanya, Kolya, Lena, Katya and Marina.
	   Now Shishkina has given birth to No. 18 in a hospital in
Voronezh, about 475 kilometers (300 miles) south of Moscow, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday. The report did not say
whether the child was a boy or girl.
	   Family members will vote on the baby's name, a procedure that
could take a month, Alexander Shishkin warned. Russians tend to
rely on just a handful of names and often name children after their
parents or other relatives.
	   The couple's oldest child is expecting a baby of her own _
bringing the Shishkins' flock of grandchildren to 43.
	   The Shishkins, who live in suburb of Voronezh, rely on their
garden to feed the family. Alexander Shishkin works as a driver,
and the regional administration grants subsidies for the six
school-age children.
	   According to the Guinness Book of Records, the record for most
children born to one woman is held by a Russian who had 69 children
in the 1700s.

Swiss struggle to cope with influx of Kosovo Albanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more detail, byline
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Already struggling with a massive influx of Kosovo
Albanians, Swiss authorities said Friday they expect the number of
asylum seekers to reach an all-time high this year.
	   Nearly 500 refugees had to fend for themselves overnight _ some
huddled under cardboard boxes for warmth _ as overflowing reception
centers closed their doors to new arrivals.
	   ``The situation is very serious and it may get worse,'' said
Vera Britsch, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Refugees.
	   Switzerland, home to a large population of ethnic Albanians, has
acted as a magnet to refugees fleeing the fighting in Serbia's
Kosovo province. But a new influx has overwhelmed local and
national authorities.
	   The government next week is to consider using soldiers to help
care for the Kosovo Albanians. And it plans to open army barracks
to house the overflow.
	   Ethnic Albanians accounted for a large chunk of the 26,000
requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the first
nine months of the year. A big jump is expected for October as many
more are believed to be en route, either via Italy or from eastern
Europe through Germany.
	   Jean-Daniel Gerber, director of the refugee office, said he
expected the number of asylum seekers to top the record of 42,000,
set in 1991, by the end of the year. Tough asylum laws cut numbers
after that.
	   Swiss officials complain that their tiny country, with a
population of 7 million, is now shouldering too much of the refugee
problem and that neighboring France, Italy and Austria should be
doing more.
	   ``We have the impression that they are concentrating on
Switzerland,'' said Britsch. ``There's no burden sharing.''
	   Germany has also seen a big increase in the number of ethnic
Albanians applying to stay.
	   Kosovo refugees pose more headaches than Bosnians who fled their
earlier civil war. And whilst there was widespread public sympathy
for Bosnians, Kosovo Albanians have a bad reputation for drug
dealing and crime.
	   Swiss refugee director Gerber faced a hostile reception from
worried residents Thursday evening in the small northern village of
Bronschhofen, where an empty army barracks is to be used for the
refugees.
	   A small device exploded at the barracks earlier this week.
	   The refugee center at nearby Kreuzlingen, on the German border,
is so crowded that people are reportedly sleeping in the kitchen
and in corridors.
	   In Basel, on the border with Germany and France, about 170
ethnic Albanians were turned away from an accommodation center
Thursday night as there was no room for them.
	   In Geneva, on the French border, 300 people had to fend for
themselves, said Britsch. Most managed to stay with friends,
although some spent the night in the open, she said.
	   ``Disgraceful,'' lamented the mass selling daily Blick above a
front-page photo of haggard refugees thronged around a wire gate.
	   ``Switzerland can't even offer a bed for refugees. It turns
people back away and sends them back into the dark night.''

Canadian Reidl drops out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Canadian Sebastian Reidl,
hampered by a contaminated fuel tank and a broken mast boom, has
become the first skipper to drop out of the 43,450-kilometer
(27,000-mile) Around Alone yachting race.
	   Reidl, who raised money by charging people between dlrs 10 and
dlrs 20 to put their names on the hull of his boat _ Project
Amazon, radioed race officials Thursday he was heading to Puerto
Rico.
	   The sailors left Charleston last month headed for Cape Town,
South Africa, their first stop. After a week at sea, water seeped
into Project Amazon's diesel fuel tank leaving Reidl no power to
run his communications equipment, stove and autopilot.
	   ``What to do?'' he messaged a sponsor, ThinkWells Inc. ``No
power, no autopilot, communication and no hot food. ... The whole
boat smells like a diesel tank, and I smell like I had fallen into
it.''
	   Reidl had no success filtering the water from the tank using
toilet paper and paper towels. He did add rubbing alcohol to the
fuel to separate the water and get the engine running well enough
to generate some power, but he didn't have enough clean fuel to
last to Cape Town.
	   On Wednesday, the boom on his 26-meter (86-foot) front mast
broke and he was unable to repair the damage.
	   ``I decided that my arrival in Cape Town would be too late to
repair my now existing deficiencies and be ready for the next leg
of the race,'' Reidl radioed race headquarters.
	   He is expected to arrive in Puerto Rico in 10 to 12 days, said
John Brooman, a spokesman for Reidl's Project Amazon campaign.
Fifteen skippers are still racing.

 &UR; Kosovo rebel army rejects U.S.-sponsored Kosovo deal
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army rejected Friday a U.S.-brokered deal with Serbia,
saying it will not end President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown in
his troubled province.
	   ``The agreement does nothing but provide Milosevic leverage to
continue with war, genocide, massacres and the deepening of the
humanitarian crisis,'' Hashim Thaci, a member of the KLA's
political wing told The Associated Press.
	   Thaci said that the KLA demands that NATO and the U.N. force
Serb troops to withdraw ``from all positions'' in Kosovo from where
they threaten the return of refugees and the freedom of movement.
	   ``If this is not done, the UCK (KLA in Albanian) will continue
the armed struggle for freedom, independence and democracy,'' Thaci
said, reading the KLA's latest announcement.
	   The agreement between Yugoslav President Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke envisages a partial withdrawal of Serb
troops from Kosovo, the safe return of tens of thousands refugees
and a 2,000-strong international verification mission.
	   Ethnic Albanian moderate political leader Ibrahim Rugova
appealed Friday for ``all Kosovars, and their political and other
groups to accept'' the OSCE monitoring force. His reference to the
``other groups'' was clearly addressed to the KLA.
	   Thaci said the KLA demands it be included in the negotiations
between the Kosovo ethnic Albanian community and Belgrade because
they are ``a crucial factor on the Albanian side.
	   ``The KLA will punish any individual or group which dares sign
an agreement contrary to the will of our people expressed in the
1991 (officially unauthorized) referendum,'' Thaci said, referring
to a vote in which Kosovo's Albanians overwhelmingly opted to
secede from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish museum agreed to pay an art
dealer 250,000 kronor (dlrs 40,850) to buy a tuna fish-size can
filled with excrement that started leaking after it was borrowed
for an exhibit, both sides announced.
	   The settlement ends legal wrangling between Randers Arts Museum,
which borrowed the Italian artistic endeavor entitled ``Merda
d'Artista,'' and dealer John Hunov, who lent it.
	   The contents came from Piero Manzoni (1933-1963), who reportedly
filled about 90 cans of similar size with his excrement in 1961.
	   ``It was made in the 1960s as a provocation to the snobbishness
in the art world,'' museum director Finn Terman Frederiksen said in
a telephone interview Friday, the day after the settlement was
publicly disclosed.
	   ``He is giving us an ironic comment on the innermost of the
artist,'' he added.
	   The can was borrowed four years ago for an exhibit on Manzoni's
work. Hunov claimed it was damaged by exposure to strong sunlight
and the museum did not take proper precautions during transport.
	   Frederiksen said the leakage probably was due to the interaction
of the can and its contents. At first, the museum refused to pay
compensation.
	   ``It's a very special situation where a piece of art has a
built-in, self-dissolving mechanism,'' he told the Copenhagen
newspaper Politiken. ``We couldn't foresee that the can would start
leaking just as it was borrowed by us.''
	   The museum's intention is to seal the can and put it back on
display, hopefully by next year, he said.
	   Randers is a small museum located 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northwest of Copenhagen.

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ As rain poured down on this tiny
monarchy, Swazis trickled into the polls Friday to practice their
peculiar form of democracy: voting in a country where parties are
banned and the king rules absolutely.
	   Police used tear gas to break up a demonstrations by about 100
protesters calling for greater democracy, the opposition said, but
no arrests were reported. The heavy rain, fog and flooding probably
kept many people at home as much as calls for a boycott by
pro-democracy groups.
	   U.S. observers reported no immediate irregularities in the
voting. Police manned roadblocks on highways into the capital and
patrolled downtown.
	   Voters in this kingdom of 1 million people bordered by South
Africa and Mozambique chose 55 representatives in the House of
Assembly. The legislature acts mainly as a rubber stamp for the
Cabinet appointed by King Mswati III, who was out of the country on
a visit to the Far East to scout out foreign investment.
	   The vote in one of the world's last absolute monarchies was
closely watched in a part of Africa where democracy received a
major boost with South Africa's first free elections in 1994. At
the same time leaders of nearby countries like Namibia and Zimbabwe
are showing increasing autocratic tendencies.
	   Swaziland, once a sex-and-gambling playground for South Africans
during the conservative years of apartheid, depends on tourism,
timber and crops like sugar and tobacco.
	   At a polling station in Lobamba, about 15 kilometers (9 miles)
outside of Mbabane and past a small herd of cattle wandering across
the highway, more than 300 people had voted by 11 a.m., election
officials said.
	   They lined up outside, wrapped in plastic or blankets, some of
the men in traditional skirts and with a red feather in their hair
-- sign of royal blood.
	   The voters marked an X beneath the picture of their choice of
candidates, who each represented a chiefdom in a district.
	   ``I am voting here for my nation,'' said Siguphlu Semhlahla, a
herbalist. ``I don't like any party. We follow our king.''
	   In the capital, it appeared most people had ignored calls by
trade unions and opposition leaders to go to work instead of
voting. No one who observed the boycott was willing to speak
openly.
	   Nationwide calls for a boycott were a success, claimed Mario
Masuku, leader of the banned pro-democracy party PUDEMO, the
People's United Democratic Organization. Masuku claimed that
turnout was only 13 percent.
	   Election officials declined to give figures on turnout, but have
said about 200,000 people were registered to vote, a bit less than
half of those eligible. Turnout in the country's first vote, in
1993, was 17 percent.
	   One group certainly did not vote. Widows during their two-year
mourning period were banned from polling places set up on royal
grounds because they are considered bad luck for the king, who has
banned them from Parliament.
	   Masuku called the government ``illegitimate,'' and said the king
is ``not sincere about democratization.''
	   ``We are calling for a constitutional monarchy. We believe the
monarchy is part of our culture, but the culture should be dynamic.
It is a very expensive institution,'' said Masuku, who was one of
three opposition figures whose house was searched this week.
	   Mswati maintains a fleet of cars and four palaces. The state
maintains his six wives and the hundreds of princes from the
previous king, Subuzhu II, who had scores of wives.
	   The king appoints 10 more members to the assembly, and 20 of the
30 members of the Senate, who then choose 10 more senators on their
own.

Rios, but the South American rallied to claim the match in one hour
and 57 minutes.

	   In the Saturday semifinals, Woodforde will face the Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherlands, who beat his countryman John van
Lottum 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.

Former member of German state parliament on trial for telephone
</HEADLINE>
fraud &QL; 
 &UR; By STEFANIE KREISS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Trial opened Friday against a former
Bavarian state legislator charged with running up 27,000 marks
(dlrs 16,770) worth of calls to a telephone sex hotline at
taxpayers' expense.
	   State prosecutor Stefan Antor needed nearly an hour without
pause to read before the court a list of 450 sex calls allegedly
made by Hans Wallner, 48, from his office in the state legislature.
	   Wallner's defense lawyer Sascha Prosotowitz said he wants state
police experts to investigate whether or not his client was a
victim of computer hackers. He said an extension to Wallner's
office phone appears to have been manipulated with the use of a
modem or other equipment.
	   And he noted that on some days, the sequence of calls would not
have left time to eat or sleep. One day, for example, calls were
placed to a sex hotline for 23 out of 32 hours. The defense also
pointed out that many of the calls ended ended exactly after 1180
units or 59 minutes.
	   But prosecutors noted that the calls suddenly stopped the same
day the defendant was notified of the bills.
	   The trial continues next week.

Excerpts from monitoring deal between OSCE and Yugoslavia

 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Here some highlights from a deal signed Friday
between OSCE and the Yugoslav government on the deployment of the 2,000
foreign ``verifiers'' in Kosovo, as translated from Serbian by The Associated
Press.
	   -- The Yugoslav government guarantees all mission members full security
... and will allow and cooperate in the evacuation of mission members in a
state of emergency, should such a circumstance arise.
	   -- The Yugoslav government will appoint liaison officers to work with the
mission.
	   -- The OSCE verifiers mission has a mandate of one year. This period can
be extended at the request of the OSCE chairman or the Yugoslav government.
	   -- The mission will have complete freedom of movement and will travel
throughout Kosovo.
	   -- The mission will receive weekly reports from Yugoslav army and Serb
police headquarters in reference to troop movement. Mission members may be
invited to follow police in Kosovo... The verification mission may be invited
or may request to accompany police units during their daily activities.
	   -- The mission will search for roadblocks and barricades ... and will
report on those and other such objects whose purpose is not traffic or crime
control. Head of mission may demand the removal of road blocks.
	   -- The mission will liaise with state bodies in connection to activities
concerning border control ... The mission may at its own request or at the
invitation of state bodies visit and follow border control units at their
daily duties.
	   -- Once a political solution for self-rule in Kosovo is reached ... the
mission will help supervise the elections, help establish institutions in
Kosovo and help with the development of Kosovo police forces.
	   -- The unarmed, 2,000-strong mission will have its seat in Pristina but
also a liaison office in Belgrade and substations in smaller towns, villages
in the province. Each sub-station will coordinate with local authorities,
including local leadership of major ethnic groups.
	   -- The Yugoslav government will accept the verification mission as a
diplomatic body, and treat it according to the Vienna Convention on
diplomatic relations.
	   -- The mission will submit its reports to the U.N. and to all
organizations pertaining to the U.N. Security Council resolution 1199.
	    -- The mission will assist the UNHCR, ICRC and other humanitarian
organizations in facilitating the return of refugees.

Portugal unveils new measures against ``mad cow'' disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Facing a European Commission threat to
ban its beef exports, Portugal will spend dlrs 18 million until the
end of the year in new measures aimed at stemming a sharp rise in
cases of ``mad cow'' disease, an official said Friday.
	   The measures include tightening government control at
slaughterhouses and in animal by-product industries as well as
destroying stocks of cattle feed with bovine remains, Agriculture
Ministry spokesman Augusto Vilela said.
	   The government will also double fines to escudos 18 million
(dlrs 110,000) for violators of the measures and others previously
approved.
	   Vilela said the European Commission was to discuss the new
measures next week.
	   Earlier this month, the Commission threatened a Europe-wide ban
on beef exports from Portugal unless the government tightened
controls on bovine animal remains used in cattle feed.
	   Neighboring Spain banned the import of Portuguese beef last
month.
	   Portugal has reported 60 new cases of ``mad cow'' disease in the
past five months, compared with a total of 94 cases for all
previous years. In addition, there are at least 28 suspected but
unconfirmed cases.
	   The disease's incubation period is long, and the recent rise in
cases has sparked fears that the scale of the problem in Portugal
may be much bigger than is apparent at present.
	   In Britain, the cattle disease, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE, has been linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, a fatal human brain ailment.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies decided Friday to
maintain the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least
Oct. 27, extending the original deadline set for Saturday morning.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible strikes, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from fully compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that Serb troops and police remained in the province.

	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
putting the planes under NATO command ready to attack. They gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until Saturday morning to
agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic in agreeing to pull his forces from
Kosovo, allow international observers and NATO planes to monitor
the deal, and start peace talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in
the province.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO officials said keeping that activation order in place would
maintain military pressure on Milosevic while he completed the
withdrawal of Serb forces and international verification of the
agreement gets underway.

American company to provide Germans jobs and power with new plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ NRG Energy, a Minnesota-based power
company, has announced plans to open a brown coal power plant in
the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt, a newspaper said Friday.
	   David Peterson, head of NRG planning, was quoted in an interview
with the daily Mitteldeutsche Zeitung as saying the new company
will create 100 to 125 jobs.
	   Using 2.5 million tons (2.8 standard U.S. tons), of lignite per
year, the new company will also ensure an estimated 100 jobs at
Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlegesellschaft mining company in Theiszen,
the report said.
	   Construction of the new power plant is to begin in mid-2000 at
an estimated cost of 800 million marks (dlrs 500 million). Power
production will begin in mid-2003, with an estimated capacity of
400 megawatts, the report said.
	   NRG's home base is Minneapolis.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO allies decided Friday to maintain
the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least Oct. 27,
extending the original Saturday deadline.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible strikes, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.

Zhirinovsky to visit Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky
will lead a delegation of his Liberal Democratic Party to Taiwan
next week, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Friday.
	   The 40-member delegation is scheduled to be in Taiwan from
Sunday to Thursday, it said. It said they will fly from Moscow to
Taipei, the first direct flight between the two capitals.
	   ITAR-Tass said Zhirinovsky was invited by the governing
Kuomintang party and is scheduled to meet Taiwanese President Lee
Teng-hui.
	   China disapproves of any foreign delegations that treat Taiwan
as an independent country. It views the island as a renegade
province that will eventually be reunified with the mainland.

10,000 CD-ROMs on Israeli air force seized in Beirut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ As if Israeli warplanes menacing
Lebanon's skies were not enough, a new computer game about Israel's
air force superiority has invaded the Lebanese market.
	   Authorities this week seized 10,000 copies of Israeli Air Force,
a CD-ROM released on the 50th anniversary of Israel's founding, the
leading newspaper An-Nahar reported Friday.
	   Five businessmen who allegedly bought the merchandise from
Malaysia were ordered detained for questioning by Military
Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud, An-Nahar said.
	   The twin CD has information about the defensive and offensive
capabilities of the Israeli air force and a documentary of its
operations against Arab countries since the creation of the Jewish
state in 1948.
	   It also has a game depicting fictitious bombing targets in
Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
	   An-Nahar said authorities blame ``Israeli intelligence for
sending the merchandise to Lebanon.'' It did not elaborate.
	   Lebanon is technically at war with Israel, whose troops occupy a
border strip in the country's south. They fight almost daily with
guerrillas trying to oust the foreign forces.
	   Israeli warplanes, on daily reconnaissance missions over
Lebanon, sometimes join ground forces in attacking the guerrillas.
	   Lebanese are not allowed to travel to Israel or have contact
with Israelis. It is a crime punishable by jail and even death. It
is also a crime to sell Israeli merchandise, but the law is not
clear on what the penalties are.
	   However, there are no laws against selling pirated software,
which is freely available here, largely imported from the Far East.
	   An-Nahar said copies of the Israeli CDs cleared customs and
appeared in computer shops in Beirut recently _ to the astonishment
of many.
	   The package was being sold for 20,000 pounds (dlrs 13). Genuine
software sells for anywhere between dlrs 20 and dlrs 150.

BRUSSELS: Serb authorities.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ``We are still at some distance from fully compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that Serb troops and police remained in the province.
	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
putting the planes under NATO command ready to attack. They gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until Saturday morning to
agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic in agreeing to pull his forces from
Kosovo, allow international observers and NATO planes to monitor
the deal, and start peace talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in
the province.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO officials said keeping that activation order in place would
maintain military pressure on Milosevic while he completed the
withdrawal of Serb forces and international verification of the
agreement gets underway.

Ukraine's parliament ratifies Chemical Weapons Convention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday ratified the
Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the design, production,
accumulation and use of chemical weapons.
	   Deputies in the 450-seat legislature voted 285-16 to ratify the
treaty, which 165 countries signed in Paris in 1993.
	   The vote followed lawmakers' unsuccessful attempt to ratify the
convention last week. Leftists refused then to support it, alleging
that it would lead to international control over chemical
production in Ukraine.
	   A total of 116 countries have already ratified the convention,
including Russia, the United States, Japan, China and European
Union members.
	   Countries that have not signed on include Iraq, Syria and Libya,
which have chemical weapons programs or had them in the past.

Spanish team extend lead in Perrier Pairs

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ Spain's Santiago Luna and Jose Rivero
stretched their lead to three shots after the second round in the
dlrs 595,000 Perrier Pairs here Friday.
	   The Spanish duo, who lost in a play-off in last year's edition,
shot a five-under-par 66 _ the best score of the day _ to finish
16-under overall at 126.
	   ``We played fantastic, wonderful golf,'' an exuberant Luna said.
We shot one-under par on the front-9 taking 17 putts!''
	   In warm, windless conditions, the Spaniards snapped up five
birdies with only one bogey over the par-71, 6,316-meter
(6,909-yard) Medoc golf course.
	   France's Raphael Jacquelin rammed in birdie putts of 14 feet (4
meters) at the 13th, a curling 50-footer (15 meters) at the 16th
and another fourteen footer (4 meters) at the 18th to move up with
partner and fellow Frenchman Jeff Remesy into second slot at 129.
	   Sweden's Jarmo Sandelin and Olle Karlsson fired 68 to finish a
further shot back at 130.
	   The Swedes shared third place with England's David J. Russell
and and Ross McFarlane who carded 67.
	   Ignacio and Carl Suneson from Spain shot 69 to slip into fifth
at 131.
	   Fading Spanish star Severiano Ballesteros partnered coutryman
Miguel Angel Jimenez to a 69 for a 9-under-par total of 133 which
left him tied eleventh.
	   ``We played better than our score but that's golf,'' Ballesteros
said.
	   The Spanish pair got to 12-under with four birdies and an eagle
but a double-bogey at the 13th and a bogey at the 16th broke their
momentum.

Runner-up in Azerbaijan presidential election to appeal results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ The runner-up in Azerbaijan's
presidential election vowed Friday to appeal the vote results to
the Supreme Court, saying the balloting was rigged.
	   Authoritarian President Geidar Aliev was re-elected in Sunday's
vote, which was boycotted by the opposition and called undemocratic
by international observers.
	   Official results showed Aliev won 76 percent of the vote in this
oil-rich former Soviet republic on the Caspian Sea, while his
nearest rival, Etibar Mamedov, won just 11 percent.
	   Mamedov told a news conference in Baku on Friday that he had
proof of vote-rigging and widespread violations and would appeal
the results to the Supreme Court.
	   Dozens of his supporters rallied Friday outside the
Constitutional Court, which approved the outcome Friday.
	   Aliev's inauguration was scheduled for Sunday.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO on Friday extended Saturday's
deadline for Yugoslavia to come into compliance with terms of a
peace deal on Kosovo, giving President Slobodan Milosevic until
Oct. 27.

	   Earlier Friday, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a second
pact in two days to make sure the Yugoslav president pulls his
forces out of the strife-torn province.
	   The accord allows 2,000 unarmed monitors for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo
and verify whether Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps his
word to end the crackdown.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
signing the agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanic.
	   Geremek said so far he had received promises from member
countries for about 800 volunteers, although he did not say how
long it would take to train, equip and station the monitors in
Kosovo.

	   Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Yugoslavia

	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule

Iranian hardliners vow to kill Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAVEH GOLESTAN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 1,000 Iranians staged a noisy
demonstration Friday against British author Salman Rushdie, vowing
to kill him and the publishers of his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   The protesters cheered as the organizers unveiled a three-story
portrait of an alleged would-be assassin of Rushdie that was
painted on an apartment building in a northern suburb of Tehran.
	   The crowd carried banners reading ``There is no turning-back
from Imam Khomeini's fatwa'' in clear opposition to the
government's decision last month to distance itself from the death
sentence imposed on Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   The ayatollah, the leader of the Islamic Revolution of 1979,
condemned the Booker Prize-winning author to death on the grounds
that his book blasphemed Islam.
	   The Iranian government said last month that it did not support
the bounty offered for the death of Rushdie and, after a meeting
between their foreign ministers on Sept. 24, Britain and Iran
decided to upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level.
	   The move has been fiercely attacked by hard-liners in Iran who
oppose the policies of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami. A
semi-government organization raised the bounty to more than dlrs
2.8 million and Friday's demonstration was the second this week by
supporters of the fatwa.
	   ``Our government must know that if they dont want to participate
in carrying out the orders of Imam Khomeini, that's fine. But if
they want to interfere with his edict, then we are facing serious
problems,'' the protest leader, Allah Karam, told the crowd through
loudspeakers.
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Rushdie must die.''
	   A man in a wheel-chair took the podium to deliver a message in
English to Rushdie: ``Listen to me. Remember my face. I'm your
killer. I want to have a dialogue with you - with a machine gun. We
will kill you.''
	   The organizers introduced another man, his face covered by a
black and white checkered scarf that revealed only his eyes, as the
person who would try to carry out the death sentence.
	   The 25 by 10 meter (82 by 33 feet) mural showed Ayatollah
Khomeini and Mustapha Mazeh, who died in 1989 in a London hotel
while working on a homemade bomb.
	   British police, who guard Rushdie closely, have dismissed
reports that Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, planned to
kill Rushdie, but in Iran he is believed to have targeted the
author.
	   The demonstrators also vowed to kill the staff of
Viking-Penguin, which originally published ``The Satanic Verses.''
The company has had its premises bombed in several countries.
	   Most of the demonstrators had earlier Friday taken part in the
funeral procession for three Iranian diplomats slain in
Afghanistan.
	   More than 10,000 people atttended the funeral of the diplomats
who were slain by Taliban militiamen in the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August. Their bodies were returned on Oct. 11.
	   The bodies of the other five diplomats and a journalist killed
during the Aug. 8 attack on the Iranian consulate were buried in
Iran last month.
	   The Taliban's return of the bodies is seen as an attempt to
improve relations with Iran, which has massed more than 200,000
troops on its border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, which now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
do not have diplomatic relations with Iran and accuse the country
of supporting their opposition.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
agreed on the foreign policy guidelines of a new center-left
coalition Friday, clearing a major hurdle in their negotiations.
	   The dominant Social Democrats stressed that the accord pledges
continuity in essential areas, such as firm German support for
NATO, European integration and partnership with the United States.
	   Both parties also agreed that foreign missions for German
soldiers should be covered by international law, a reference to a
United Nations mandate.
	   The accord signaled a coming of age for the Greens, a party with
pacifist leanings rooted in the 1980s European peace movement.
Radical demands in their election platform, such as a call for
eventually disbanding NATO, were thwarted by the Social Democrats.
	   Both sides said the talks had gone unexpectedly smoothly.
	   ``We knew from the start that we would not be able to cancel the
reigning logic in foreign policy,'' said Ludger Volmer, the leading
Greens left-winger.
	   Hours earlier, he abstained in a vote by the outgoing parliament
on sending German warplanes into any NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia if it fails to comply with this week's peace accord on
Kosovo. Most Greens and Social Democrats supported the measure,
which passed by a vote of 500-62.
	   With the coalition deal, Volmer said he expected that such
conflict would not resurface during the new government's four-year
term because both parties are calling for more emphasis on
preventive diplomacy.
	   A Greens demand for abolishing compulsory military service was
referred to a commission that will debate army reforms.
	   Both sides also said they would honor a commitment made by
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government backing the
Eurofighter military jet.
	   ``We'd like to get out of the Eurofighter, but we have to honor
the agreements,'' Volmer said.
	   Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy hope to break U.S. domination
in the fighter jet market by cooperating in building their own.
Their first firm order, 14 billion marks (dlrs 8.75 billion) for
148 planes came in September.
	   After the announcement, both parties went back into talks on
energy taxes that were expected to last into the night. No
announcements were planned afterward.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has said he would not accept
more than a 6 pfennig (4 cent) a liter increase, far less than the
Greens wanted.
	   Noting that both parties want to use revenue from energy taxes
to finance job-spurring cuts in other taxes, Greens leader Kerstin
Mueller said it was up to the Social Democrats ``to come and make
new proposals.''
	   The two sides also wanted to put the final touches on a plan to
shut down Germany's nuclear reactors.
	   Board members of German utilities meeting Friday reiterated
their willingness to enter talks with the new government, while
adding that any agreement would have to be economically as well as
ecologically viable.
	   Also Friday, German media reported finance minister-designate
Oskar Lafontaine wants to plug holes caused by the previous
government's over-optimistic growth forecasts by increasing
Germany's budget deficit.
	   Lafontaine said there were gaps to fill, but no decision yet on
how that would be accomplished.
	   ``If there's less money there, one has to discuss what to do,''
he said.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens have charged the outgoing
government's budget contains a revenue shortfall of at least 20
billion marks (dlrs 12 billion).
	   Outgoing Finance Minister Theo Waigel has denied his budget
contained any gaps, although he did on Friday effectively revise
his projection for 1999 economic growth down from 3 percent to 2.5
percent.
	   Lafontaine believes gross domestic product is likely to grow
only 2.25 percent in 1999.

NATO ambassadors extend airstrike deadline to Oct. 27

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO allies decided Friday to maintain
the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least Oct. 27,
extending the original Saturday deadline.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible strikes, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from fully compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that an unaceptable number of Serb troops and police
remained in the province.
	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
putting the planes under NATO command ready to attack. They gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until Saturday morning to
agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic in agreeing to reduce his forces in
Kosovo to levels before he began a seven-month crackdown, to allow
international observers and NATO planes to monitor the deal, and to
start peace talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in the province.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO officials said keeping that activation order in place would
maintain military pressure on Milosevic while he completed the
withdrawal of Serb forces and international verification of the
agreement gets underway.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Here are some highlights from a deal
signed Friday between OSCE and the Yugoslav government on the
deployment of the 2,000 foreign ``verifiers'' in Kosovo, as carried
by the state-run Tanjug news agency and translated from Serbian by
The Associated Press.
	   -- The Yugoslav government guarantees all mission members full
security ... and will allow and cooperate in the evacuation of
mission members in a state of emergency, should such a circumstance
arise.
	   -- The Yugoslav government will appoint liaison officers to work
with the mission.
	   -- The OSCE verifiers mission has a mandate of one year. This
period can be extended at the request of the OSCE chairman or the
Yugoslav government.
	   -- The mission will have complete freedom of movement and will
travel throughout Kosovo.
	   -- The mission will receive weekly reports from Yugoslav army
and Serb police headquarters in reference to troop movement.
Mission members may be invited to follow police in Kosovo... The
verification mission may be invited or may request to accompany
police units during their daily activities.
	   -- The mission will search for roadblocks and barricades ... and
will report on those and other such devices whose purpose is not
traffic or crime control. Head of mission may demand the removal of
road blocks.
	   -- The mission will liaise with state bodies in connection to
activities concerning border control ... The mission may at its own
request or at the invitation of state bodies visit and follow
border control units at their daily duties.
	   -- Once a political solution for self-rule in Kosovo is reached
... the mission will help supervise the elections, help establish
institutions in Kosovo and help with the development of Kosovo
police forces.
	   -- The unarmed, 2,000-strong mission will have its seat in
Pristina but also a liaison office in Belgrade and substations in
smaller towns, villages in the province. Each sub-station will
coordinate with local authorities, including local leadership of
major ethnic groups.
	   -- The Yugoslav government will accept the verification mission
as a diplomatic body, and treat it according to the Vienna
Convention on diplomatic relations.
	   -- The mission will submit its reports to the U.N. and to all
organizations pertaining to the U.N. Security Council resolution
1199.
	   -- The mission will assist the UNHCR, ICRC and other
humanitarian organizations in facilitating the return of refugees.

New promises aim to head off new wave of student protest, violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs; UPDATES with new measures, media reax, background
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Shaken by a nationwide protest for more school aid
by more than a half million students, coupled with rioting by gangs
of hoodlums, French officials on Friday sought to calm a movement
that threatened to resume next week.
	   France on Friday examined the two faces on the streets the day
before, with newspapers showing both smiling kids in face paint
demanding more educational funding, and masked youths smashing,
burning and looting.
	   Commentaries described the two as one: youth angered by
neglected classrooms and poor neighborhoods surrounding Paris and
other cities. The tabloid daily France-Soir saw a deeper problem of
a nation beset with double-digit unemployment and crime, and in
need of reform.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre promised Friday to hire more
teachers and modernize schools, hoping to respond to students fed
up with overcrowded classrooms and a lack of computers, lab
equipment and other teaching aids.
	   Allegre said the moves were agreed upon during a meeting with
student representatives Thursday, when some 500,000 high school
students marched in dozens of towns and cities across France.
	   Allegre said in an interview Friday on Europe-1 radio that he
and student leaders had agreed on ``immediate action'' on tackling
overcrowded classrooms, a lack of teachers and outdated facilities.
	   The education minister also said he was ``aghast and sorry''
about violence during Thursday's marches that left at least two
people seriously injured.
	   Allegre is reined in by the leftist government's budget limits
ahead of the euro single currency next year. Students said they
planned a new protest Tuesday, marching to the National Assembly on
the eve of a planned budget vote.
	   Two teachers' unions appealed Friday to their members to take
part.
	   The students also demand that authorities lighten their heavy
course load and improve instruction in large classes they say are
sometimes out of control.
	   ``It's impossible to talk, there's no discipline,'' complained
16-year-old Emilie Bono about her 40-member class, as she protested
in Paris on Thursday. ``The teacher has no authority.''
	   Police also came under fire for being caught off-guard Thursday.
	   ``Overwhelmed!'' headlined Le Parisien, with pictures of
overturned cars and kids breaking into a pharmacy.
	   About 2,500 police struggled to control hundreds of rowdies,
about 150 of whom were arrested. In Paris, five people were
injured, about 50 shops looted and 100 cars damaged, some of them
burned.
	   Some students in the protest were reportedly robbed or attacked
by hoodlums.
	   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said that ``justice would be
severe for the rioters,'' and some speedy trials meted out jail
sentences of several months to underline the threat.
	   The rioting was also seen as an expression of frustration by
youth in neighborhoods where the young-adult unemployment rate _
already about 25 percent nationwide _ can run as high as 50 percent
or more.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has instituted a youth
employment program since taking office in June last year, but
critics say more help is needed. Some say the country's strict job
laws need to be loosened to boost employment.
	   Several small student demonstrations took place Friday. In the
southwestern city of Bayonne, about 150 students briefly occupied
the train station and unsuccessfully tried to block the departure
of a high-speed TGV train, police said.
	   Other protests were reported in Marseille, Saint-Malo and some
towns in eastern France.

Central bank to decide which Russian banks to save
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's central bank has not yet decided which
commercial banks it will rescue from the country's financial
crisis, but hopes to do so in a few weeks, a top bank official said
Friday.
	   Russia's currency collapse and default on its treasury bills
paralyzed most banking activity and caused some banks to fail.
Banks remain wary of dealing with one another, fearing the other
party may be insoluble.
	   Vice Chairman Tatiana Paramonova said the central bank managed
to restart some interbank activity with an elaborate debt offset
plan announced last month. However, some banks will still fail, she
said on Russian television.
	   ``Many banks, some specific banks, can't function normally
because they are pressured by current circumstances and pressured
by their bad assets,'' she said.
	   The central bank said it is seeking advice from both the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank on restarting the
country's banking system. An IMF delegation is due on Moscow on
Tuesday.
	   Russia's private banks sprouted rapidly after the Soviet
collapse in 1991 and the beginning of free-market reforms. But
critics say they have been poorly regulated and were already
vulnerable before the latest crisis hit.

	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ As rain poured down on this tiny
monarchy, Swazis trickled into the polls Friday to practice their
peculiar form of democracy: voting in a country where parties are
banned and the king rules absolutely.
	   Police used tear gas to break up a demonstrations by about 100
protesters calling for greater democracy, the opposition said, but
no arrests were reported. The heavy rain, fog and flooding probably
kept many people at home as much as calls for a boycott by
pro-democracy groups.
	   U.S. observers reported no immediate irregularities in the
voting. Police manned roadblocks on highways into the capital and
patrolled downtown.
	   Voters in this kingdom of 1 million people bordered by South
Africa and Mozambique chose 55 representatives in the House of
Assembly. The legislature acts mainly as a rubber stamp for the
Cabinet appointed by King Mswati III, who was out of the country on
a visit to the Far East to scout out foreign investment.
	   The vote in one of the world's last absolute monarchies was
closely watched in a part of Africa where democracy received a
major boost with South Africa's first free elections in 1994. At
the same time leaders of nearby countries like Namibia and Zimbabwe
are showing increasing autocratic tendencies.
	   Eyes also were on Swaziland because of Sub Saharan Africa's
other monarchy, Lesotho, where months of opposition unrest over May
elections led to a military intervention by South Africa, which
surrounds the tiny state.

	   If he succeeds, Italy would get its farthest left-leaning
government yet. Although D'Alema himself stands with Italy's
moderates on such matters as privatization and NATO, to secure a
majority he could have to offer Cabinet seats to the hard-core
Communists, who oppose both and are generally anti-American.
	   D'Alema leads the Democratic Left, a more moderate successor of
what until earlier in the 1990s was Italy's Communist Party. The
Democratic Left is the largest in Parliament and _ until a week ago
_ part of the governing Olive Tree coalition of Romano Prodi.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost the support of
Italy's diehard Communists, who said his deficit-cutting budget
didn't do enough to create jobs. Prodi admitted defeat Thursday in
efforts to cobble together a new majority and his Olive Tree threw
its support to D'Alema.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of the centrists and somehow guarantee their
coexistence with his hard-line Communist allies. Some observers say
that could mean giving Cabinet appointments to both.

 &UR; NATO ambassadors extend airstrike deadline to Oct. 27
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO statement, COMBINES URGENT series &QL; 
 &UR; with Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies decided Friday to
maintain the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least
Oct. 27, extending the original deadline set for Saturday morning.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible strikes, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from fully compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that Serb troops and police remained in the province.
	   Because of that, NATO ``decided to maintain its readiness to
launch air operations against Yugoslavia, including the deployment
of substantial air forces in the region,'' a NATO statement said.
	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
putting the planes under NATO command ready to attack. They gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until Saturday morning to
agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic in agreeing to pull his forces from
Kosovo to level from before the crackdown, allow international
observers and NATO planes to monitor the deal, and start peace
talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in the province.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO officials said keeping that activation order in place would
maintain military pressure on Milosevic while he completed the
withdrawal of Serb forces and international verification of the
agreement gets underway.

	   After meeting with Scalfaro on Friday, central party leader
Francesco Cossiga said he thought the chances were good for
creating a coalition with room for both centrists and Communists,
and said he was willing to negotiate with D'Alema.
	   ``We won't rule anyone out,'' he told reporters.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.
Until the Cold War ended, one of the guiding principals of the
nation's political system was to keep the Communists out of power.
	   Centrist coalitions long barred the left from power, though it
controlled some regional governments and has heavy influence in
universities and cultural institutions.
	   D'Alema started his political career with local administrative
jobs with the Communist Party, then became head of the Young
Communists' Federation in 1975. He edited the party newspaper from
1988-1990 and later took over what became the Democratic Left.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO on Friday extended Saturday's
deadline for Yugoslavia to come into compliance with terms of a
peace deal on Kosovo, giving President Slobodan Milosevic until
Oct. 27 to honor the agreement.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the force of about
400 warplanes ready for possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo
deal struck this week with Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that an unacceptable number of Serb troops
and police remained in the province.
	   The extension was expected to be granted, giving both the
Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light of this week's
steps toward compliance.
	   Earlier Friday, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a second
pact in two days to make sure the Yugoslav president pulls his
forces out of the strife-torn province.
	   The accord allows 2,000 unarmed monitors for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo
and verify whether Milosevic keeps his word to end the crackdown.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
signing the agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanic.
	   Geremek said so far he had received promises from member
countries for about 800 volunteers, although he did not say how
long it would take to train, equip and station the monitors in
Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Yugoslavia
shortly under an accord signed late Thursday by NATO and the
Yugoslav military, allowing the planes to monitor compliance. NATO
officials, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity, said U2 spy
planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this weekend. Jet
fighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy planes are
threatened, they said.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule
in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000 refugees
to return to their homes.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite some progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   The focus for now is on getting the huge monitoring mission
going, giving Milosevic more time to demonstrate compliance.
	   ``Its first task is to stop bloodshed and avoid humanitarian
disaster,'' Geremek told reporters. ``And the second to create
conditions for dialogue between the Kosovo Albanian community and
the federal government.''
	   In a sign the military alternative is still in place, Germany on
Friday committed warplanes to any NATO airstrikes called to make
Yugoslavia comply with the Kosovo peace deal.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown in February to crush militant resistance in the southern
Serbian province, which is populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a six-truck aid convoy to Djakovica
near the Albanian border today and were stepping up aid efforts,
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. She said workers had
observed a continuing widespread fear among refugees of the Serb
forces, preventing them from returning to their homes.

Foreign secretary meets Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met British author
Salman Rushdie on Friday for private discussions.
	   The Foreign Office declined to say anything about the meeting,
stressing that it was private, although a spokesman, speaking on
terms of customary anonymity, said that the two men had ''taken
stock of developments.''
	   Rushdie has been protected by the government since 1989, when
the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed
that the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' should be killed.
	   Last month, Cook met Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in
New York, and Kharrazi said his government was distancing itself
from rewards offered for Rushdie's death.
	   However, on Monday a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5
million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8
million.
	   Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward
of dlrs 333,000.

Yeltsin cancels foreign trip

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with regional leader confident Yeltsin will serve full
term. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still
recuperating from his latest illness, canceled a trip to an Asian
summit next month, his office said Friday.
	   Government officials said the president also called off a visit
to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were
still going forward.
	   Yeltsin decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the
November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, because it deals mostly with financial issues, Yeltsin's
office said.
	   But officials in Primakov's office said the cancellation was due
to concerns about how the long flight might affect the president's
health.
	   The president is suffering from a respiratory infection that
forced him to cut short a visit to Central Asia on Monday.
	   He spent Friday at his country home outside Moscow after defying
doctors' orders and working in the Kremlin for the past two days.
Aides said the president's condition was ``satisfactory.''
	   Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28
summit of European countries, the president's office said.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, considered a potential
presidential candidate, said that he would not rule out the
possibility of Yeltsin's resignation for health reasons.
	   Luzhkov spoke publicly about Yeltsin's health for the first time
in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday,
and followed up on the topic while on a trip Friday to the Ural
Mountains city of Ufa.
	   ``The situation with the president's health is such that he is
unlikely to be able to effectively govern the country through the
remaining period (of his term),'' he told reporters in remarks
broadcast by Russian television.
	   ``If it's a temporary illness, you have to assess it
accordingly,'' Luzhkov said. ``If it's something serious, making
the person unable to work constantly and efficiently while
exercising his functions, then he must find the will power and
courage to say that.''
	   Luzhkov has always been supportive of Yeltsin and had never
before questioned the president's health or ability to govern.
	   ``The president must make the decision. If he feels bad, he must
tell us that,'' he added.
	   But a regional leader said he was confident Yeltsin would serve
out his term.
	   President Mintimer Shaimiyev of Tatarstan urged people ``not to
give into emotions and to appreciate the person who dedicated
himself to restructuring,'' Interfax reported.
	   Yeltsin has a long history of health problems, including a heart
bypass surgery two years ago. Each new ailment rekindles
speculation about his fitness to govern.
	   The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health
problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.
	   Yeltsin is expected to return to work in the Kremlin on Monday,
where he has meetings scheduled with Primakov and the minister
responsible for relations with other Soviet republics.

 &UR; NATO ambassadors extend airstrike deadline to Oct. 27
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with NATO statement, SUBS 3rd graf pvs to fix typo in

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO allies decided Friday to maintain
the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least Oct. 27,
extending the original Saturday morning deadline.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible strikes, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that an unacceptable number of Serb troops and police
remained in the province.
	   Because of that, NATO ``decided to maintain its readiness to
launch air operations against Yugoslavia, including the deployment
of substantial air forces in the region,'' a NATO statement said.
	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
putting the planes under NATO command ready to attack. They gave
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic until Saturday morning to
agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic to agreeing to pull his forces from
Kosovo to level from before the crackdown, allow international
observers and NATO planes to monitor the deal, and start peace
talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in the province.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO officials said keeping that activation order in place would
maintain military pressure on Milosevic while he completed the
withdrawal of Serb forces and international verification of the
agreement gets underway.

U.N. envoy begins shuttle diplomacy on divided Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS next week's war games grafs 8-11; No Pickup

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The U.N.'s resident representative in
Cyprus started on Friday a series of meeting with leaders of the
estranged Greek and Turkish communities in the U.N.'s latest bid to
reunite this war-divided island.
	   Ann Hercus met President Glafcos Clerides in Nicosia and said
she would meet with Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Wednesday in the Turkish-occupied part of the capital.
	   Hercus, from New Zealand, said she was due to meet Clerides
again next Thursday, but revealed nothing on the substance of her
talks with Clerides.
	   The shuttle diplomacy is aimed at finding sufficient common
ground to restart direct negotiations to end the unofficial
division of Cyprus caused by Turkey's 1974 invasion and the
subsequent occupation of the northern third of the Mediterranean
island.
	   The invasion was in response to a coup inspired by the Greek
military to unite Cyprus with Greece. The island's two communities
have lived apart since then on either sides of a ``green line,''
which is policed by a U.N. force.
	   Clerides and Denktash last met in Switzerland in August last
year for U.N.-sponsored negotiations that failed to narrow their
differences. Denktash has since said that he had no wish to resume
talks unless the Greek Cypriots, whose government is the only
internationally recognized administration on the island, withdraws
its bid to join the European Union. He has also demanded the
recognition of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus.
	   Clerides, whose government began membership talks with the EU in
March, has rejected both conditions.
	   The start of the talks coincided with an announcement by a Greek
Cypriot general that Greek air, ground and naval forces would take
part in war games scheduled to begin in Cyprus next week.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Brigadier-General Panayiotis
Tatsiopoulos said that in the drills, Greek warplanes would use a
controversial new air base near the western town of Paphos.
	   Greek-Turkish tension rose considerably in March when Greek jets
landed at the Paphos base less than a month after its completion.
	   Turkey condemned the deployment as belligerent and sent
warplanes to the north of the island days later.
	   Although allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Greece and Turkey have a rivalry going back centuries and both are
committed to the defense of their fellow communities on Cyprus.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's president asked ex-communist Massimo D'Alema
on Friday to try to form a new governing majority, giving D'Alema
the chance to become the country's first-ever premier to emerge
from the old Communist Party.
	   If he succeeds, Italy would get its farthest left-leaning
government yet. Although D'Alema himself stands with Italy's
moderates on such matters as privatization and NATO, to secure a
majority he could have to offer Cabinet seats to the hard-core
Communists, who oppose both and are generally anti-American.
	   Calling President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's mandate a ``great
responsibility,'' D'Alema said, ``I'll try to reduce conflicts and
to not let down expectations.''
	   D'Alema leads the Democratic Left, a more moderate successor of
what until earlier in the 1990s was Italy's Communist Party. The
Democratic Left is the largest in Parliament and _ until a week ago
_ part of the governing Olive Tree coalition of Romano Prodi.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost the support of
Italy's diehard Communists, who said his deficit-cutting budget
didn't do enough to create jobs. Prodi admitted defeat Thursday in
efforts to cobble together a new majority and his Olive Tree threw
its support to D'Alema.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of the centrists and somehow guarantee their
coexistence with his hard-line Communist allies. Some observers say
that could mean giving Cabinet appointments to both.
	   After meeting with Scalfaro on Friday, central party leader
Francesco Cossiga said he thought the chances were good for
creating a coalition with room for both centrists and Communists,
and said he was willing to negotiate with D'Alema.
	   ``We won't rule anyone out,'' he told reporters.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.
Until the Cold War ended, one of the guiding principals of the
nation's political system was to keep the Communists out of power.
	   Centrist coalitions long barred the left from power, though it
controlled some regional governments and has heavy influence in
universities and cultural institutions.
	   D'Alema started his political career with local administrative
jobs with the Communist Party, then became head of the Young
Communists' Federation in 1975. He edited the party newspaper from
1988-1990 and later took over what became the Democratic Left.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Wole Soyinka, long one of Nigeria's
boldest junta critics on Friday predicted a new era of political
reforms in this West African country divided by ethnic conflicts
and military rule for several decades.
	   Addressing wildly cheering jean-clad university students and
suit-and-tie academics at his first public address since returning
from four years in exile, Soyinka said he believed the country had
turned a corner towards democracy.
	   Soyinka is one of Nigeria's best-known authors who has written
more than 20 works of plays, poetry and fiction and became the
first African to win the Nobel prize for literature in 1986.
	   ``The era of subterfuge is over,'' he said. ``The people have
been denied the right to a part in the national state for too
long.''
	   The lecture _ at Lagos' former Nigerian Law School campus _ was
his first public appearance since he was received home at the
international airport on Wednesday evening by crowds of singing
supporters.
	   Soyinka had earlier hedged on returning to his homeland, despite
invitations from Nigeria's new military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, who in recent months has released political prisoners and
promised presidential elections in February and a handover to
civilian leaders in May.
	   On Friday, Soyinka was clearly buoyed by the experience of
addressing the 450-strong crowd. Outside, banners proclaimed his
welcome and elite police units stood guard.
	   ``I shall not be brief as I have carried a lot on my mind these
past years and not merely the past four years of exile. I intend to
be discursive,'' he said to roars of approval.
	   In his 23-page speech, the 64-year-old writer lashed out at
Nigeria's late dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, under whose rule Soyinka
fled the country to neighboring Benin in 1994.
	   Soyinka urged Nigerians to push for increasing federal powers
allowing the country's four main regions to collect _ and
distribute _ their own government revenue.
	   ``Centralization has been the bane of our country,'' he said.
	   Nigeria, where the mainly-Christian southern provinces are rich
in oil and gas, has long been dominated by military leaders from
the predominantly-Muslim north. Ethnic divisions have divided the
country since colonial times and frequently explode into violent
confrontations.
	   Military regimes have led Nigeria for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960.
	   Comparing Abacha with such despots as Adolph Hitler and Idi
Amin, Soyinka said Abacha's rule had taught Nigerians that ``as
long as you are sufficiently ruthless amoral and manipulative,
power is within grasp of even the mentally deficient.''
	   Some in the audience said Soyinka's return home was primarily of
symbolic importance. He has little mass appeal outside the academic
community, said Oladini Oladameji, a Lagos university professor.
	   Soyinka has not announced any political ambitions and is not
known to be linked to a Nigerian party.
	   ``He is not a group person and we don't expect him to run for
office,'' said Oladameji. ``Soyinka is like a one-man army.''
	   Surrounded by throngs of admirers who gave him several prolonged
standing ovations, Soyinka spoke on a podium near two seats left
empty to commemorate the late opposition leader Moshood Abiola and
his wife, Kudirat.
	   Abiola died in prison shortly before he was expected to be
released in July. His wife was mysteriously gunned down in 1996.
Both were critics of Abacha, who silenced his opponents by jailing,
threatening and in some cases, summarily executing them.
	   Soyinka is expected to return to his job as lecturer at Emory
University in Atlanta next week. It is not known if he will visit
with Abubakar, who has reportedly praised Soyinka's arrival as a
boon for the country's democratic hopes.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ International terrorism is one of the most
dangerous global threats, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday.
	   ``It is possible to curb it and eliminate it together, only by
pooling efforts of all states and related international
structures,'' Ivanov said in St. Petersburg.
	   ``Illicit drug trafficking is also one of the most dangerous
evils, in whose way we must put a powerful international barrier.''
	   Ivanov was speaking at ceremonies marking the 200th anniversary
of the birth of Russian diplomat Alexander Gorchakov.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Marking the 20th anniversary of his election
to the papacy, Pope John Paul II on Friday reminisced sentimentally
with fellow Poles and asked for prayers so he can keep doing God's
work ``right to the end.''
	   ``I thank God for having given me the grace to announce the good
news of salvation to many peoples and many nations on all the
continents, and among them also my compatriots on Polish soil,''
John Paul said, speaking slowly but steadily from an armchair
placed under a canopy on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
	   About 20,000 Poles, many of them journeying overnight on buses
from their homeland, streamed into St. Peter's Square for a Mass in
Polish celebrated by Warsaw Cardinal Jozef Glemp in the pope's
honor.
	   ``I ask you again to pray so that I can carry out right to the
end the work that God entrusted to me, for his glory in the service
of the church and of the world,'' said John Paul, who came out to
greet the crowd in the square after the Mass.
	   At 6:44 p.m., on Oct. 16, 1978, word was delivered in that same
cobblestoned square that Karol Wojtyla, the 58-year-old archbishop
of Krakow, had been chosen to lead the Roman Catholic Church.
	   At the same time Friday, John Paul appeared at the window of his
private apartment and looked down at the square, where a megascreen
was set up to broadcast a film clip of that announcement 20 years
ago.
	   ``After 20 years, I'd like to thank Divine Providence, and also
those of you present in St. Peter's Square for recalling this
moment, so important in the life of the Church of Rome, of the
universal church and, naturally, in my life,'' the pontiff told the
crowd.
	   Via a live relay on the megascreen, the pope also heard church
bells ring in Krakow in his honor.
	   The announcement two decades ago that the church had its first
non-Italian pope in 455 years astonished the world and worried
authorities in the Soviet bloc.

	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police are investigating Dutch
league leader Feyenoord Rotterdam for suspected tax evasion and
fraud involving millions of guilders, a spokeswoman said Friday.
	   Tax authorities seized the club's accounting books Tuesday and
searched offices, said Carola de Kimpe of the Rotterdam Public
Prosecutor's office.
	   Authorities also questioned club chairman, businessman Jorien
van den Herik. No arrests have been made.
	   De Kimpe said the tax offenses are believed to have happened ``a
few years ago.''
	   In an initial reaction, the club described the investigation as
``a difference of opinion'' between it and tax authorities.
	   The dispute is over the payment of taxes on transfer fees paid
by the club for foreign stars.

NATO extends deadline for Yugoslav compliance on Kosovo

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO on Friday extended Saturday's
deadline for Yugoslavia to come into compliance with terms of a
peace deal on Kosovo, giving President Slobodan Milosevic until
Oct. 27 to honor the agreement.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the force of about
400 warplanes ready for possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo
deal struck this week with Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that an unacceptable number of Serb troops
and police remained in the province.
	   The extension was expected to be granted, giving both the
Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light of this week's
steps toward compliance.
	   Earlier Friday, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a second
pact in two days to make sure the Yugoslav president pulls his
forces out of the strife-torn province.
	   The accord allows 2,000 unarmed monitors for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo
and verify whether Milosevic keeps his word to end the crackdown.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
signing the agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanic.
	   Geremek said so far he had received promises from member
countries for about 800 volunteers, although he did not say how
long it would take to train, equip and station the monitors in
Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Yugoslavia
shortly under an accord signed late Thursday by NATO and the
Yugoslav military, allowing the planes to monitor compliance. NATO
officials, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity, said U2 spy
planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this weekend. Jet
fighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy planes are
threatened, they said.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule
in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000 refugees
to return to their homes.
	   Amid new accusations by Kosovo Albanian refugees of Serb police
intimidation, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Thursday in
Belgrade that despite some progress, Milosevic had a long way to go
to meet his promises.
	   ``He must comply, he must comply fully and immediately,'' Solana
said after meeting with the Yugoslav leader. ``According to our
information, and our information is good, many army and special
police units remain in Kosovo.''
	   The focus for now is on getting the huge monitoring mission
going, giving Milosevic more time to demonstrate compliance.
	   ``Its first task is to stop bloodshed and avoid humanitarian
disaster,'' Geremek told reporters. ``And the second to create
conditions for dialogue between the Kosovo Albanian community and
the federal government.''
	   In a sign the military alternative is still in place, Germany on
Friday committed warplanes to any NATO airstrikes called to make
Yugoslavia comply with the Kosovo peace deal.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown in February to crush militant resistance in the southern
Serbian province, which is populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   The secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army also has killed more
than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic Albanians loyal
to Milosevic's government.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating.
	   The U.N. refugee agency sent a six-truck aid convoy to Djakovica
near the Albanian border today and were stepping up aid efforts,
spokeswoman Judith Kumin said in Geneva. She said workers had
observed a continuing widespread fear among refugees of the Serb
forces, preventing them from returning to their homes.

Russian parliament calls for expanded relations with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament called Friday for expanded
relations with Iran, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The State Duma lower house approved a resolution recommending
the government and other public groups promote political, economic
and cultural ties between the two countries.
	   ``The State Duma attaches a great importance to the cooperation
of Russia and Iran in the settlement of conflicts in Asia,'' the
resolution said.
	   Both Russia and Iran ``are interested in the soonest termination
of the war in Afghanistan and its turning into a peaceful
flourishing independent state, which respects the human rights, the
rights of all ethnic communities and religions,'' it said.
	   Russia and Iran could also cooperate in bringing stability to
the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where violence continues
to flare despite the formal end of a 5-year civil war, the
resolution said.
	   The resolution also urged cooperation on managing the resources
of the Caspian Sea, which is rich in oil as well as sea life.
Russia and Iran are two of the five countries that border the sea
and which are trying to negotiate a treaty on its use.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO extended its deadline to strike
against Yugoslavia, as President Slobodan Milosevic took another
step Friday to comply with international demands by allowing 2,000
foreign monitors into his troubled province.
	   NATO extended Saturday's deadline for Yugoslavia to come into
compliance with terms of a peace deal on Kosovo until Oct. 27. The
Alliance wanted to keep the force of about 400 warplanes ready for
possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo deal struck this week
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that unacceptable Serb troops and police
remained in the province.
	   In Belgrade, the government signed a deal with the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow 2,000
OSCE ``verifiers'' to monitor Milosevic's pledge to withdraw his
troops and allow the return of tens of thousands of refugees.
	   And in another sign that Milosevic was reacting to NATO
pressure, there were reports of a major withdrawal of Serb-led
security troops from Kosovo Friday afternoon.
	   ``This is only the first step,'' OSCE chairman Bronislaw
Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said after signing the
verification agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic.
	   Under the agreement, the unarmed monitors will be allowed to
roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn the additional
troops and to reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it is safe to
return home.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO spy planes will begin flying over Kosovo shortly under an
agreement signed late Thursday by NATO's supreme allied commander
for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The U2 spy planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this
weekend. Jetfighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy
planes are threatened, NATO sources said in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity.
	   That will help NATO determine Milosevic's compliance even before
the monitors start their work on the ground.
	   Geremek said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the
unarmed force and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he
had received promises from member countries for about 800
volunteers, although he did not say how long it would take to
train, equip and station them in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with the main ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, Geremek said in Kosovo's capital Pristina: ``I have
received assurances from Mr. Rugova about his participation in the
peace process.''
	   Rugova said, ``I believe that we can assure that everybody will
take part in this agreement and cooperate with the OSCE mission.
The people of Kosovo are interested in an international presence
that will protect them.''
	   But the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army issued a
statement later in the day, saying it rejects the U.S.-brokered
deal for the strife-torn province.
	   Hashim Thaci, a member of the KLA's political wing, told The
Associated Press that NATO and the U.N. have to force Serb troops
to withdraw ``from all positions'' from where they threaten the
return of refugees and the freedom of movement.
	   ``If this is not done, the KLA will continue the armed struggle
for freedom, independence and democracy,'' Thaci said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush the KLA. Its soldiers have
killed more than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic
Albanians loyal to Milosevic's government.
	   According to Serb sources, a policeman was killed Thursday
evening near the town of Orahovac, some 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, said that Serb
police had killed one Albanian and wounded another Thursday.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, and most of them favor independence or substantial
self-rule. The United States has been spearheading international
efforts to revive negotiations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose the militants'
demand for independence, fearing this could lead to further
instability among ethnic Albanian communities throughout the
southern Balkans.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   Aid workers said there is enough food and other supplies to
sustain the scattered population during the winter if they can
return to their homes, but meeting medical needs will be a
difficult challenge.

Status of Milosevic's promises

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Status of promises that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
must back up with evidence of compliance by NATO's deadline --
extended Friday until Oct. 27 -- or face renewed threat of
airstrikes for his crackdown in Kosovo:
	   _ Immediately halt all hostilities in Kosovo:
	   No major fighting has been reported this week in the southern
Serbian province.
	   _Withdraw forces and heavy armaments to levels before the
crackdown began Feb. 28:
	   In announcing the extension of the deadline, NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea said the Alliance has ``clear evidence'' that Serb
troops and police remain in the province at levels considered above
those permitted. Some army troops, however, were seen leaving the
field on Friday.
	   _ Start serious talks with ethnic Albanians on self-rule:
	   No date for the start of talks has been announced. However, the
two sides have been holding separate discussions with U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill.
	   _ Help refugees return to their homes:
	   The U.N. and International Red Cross say many refugees are
afraid to return home because they believe Serb forces are still
hidden in areas near ethnic Albanian villages. Some refugees claim
Serb troops fire weapons at night to intimidate them.
	   _ Allow unhindered work by humanitarian organizations:
	   The U.N. refugee agency and others have resumed aid convoys,
which they had suspended Monday for fear of Serb attacks if NATO
launched airstrikes.
	   _ Cooperate with the International War Crimes Tribunal:
	   U.N. war crimes investigators have received Yugoslav visas and
plan to return to Kosovo soon.
	   _ Allow a 2,000-member international verification force into
Kosovo to verify that Yugoslavia is keeping its word:
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the
Yugoslav government signed an agreement Friday allowing the force
to work in Kosovo. OSCE has received commitments for 800 of the
2,000 authorized personnel.

Russian parliament calls for expanded relations with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Communists complaining Zhirinovsky was rude
during debate. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament called Friday for expanded
relations with Iran, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The State Duma lower house approved a resolution recommending
the government and other public groups promote political, economic
and cultural ties between the two countries.
	   ``The State Duma attaches a great importance to the cooperation
of Russia and Iran in the settlement of conflicts in Asia,'' the
resolution said.
	   Both Russia and Iran ``are interested in the soonest termination
of the war in Afghanistan and its turning into a peaceful
flourishing independent state, which respects the human rights, the
rights of all ethnic communities and religions,'' it said.
	   Russia and Iran could also cooperate in bringing stability to
the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where violence continues
to flare despite the formal end of a 5-year civil war, the
resolution said.
	   The resolution also urged cooperation on managing the resources
of the Caspian Sea, which is rich in oil as well as sea life.
Russia and Iran are two of the five countries that border the sea
and which are trying to negotiate a treaty on its use.
	   After the debate, Communist lawmakers filed a protest with the
parliamentary ethics committee, complaining that ultranationalist
leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky had acted rudely.
	   Zhirinovsky disagreed with the Iran resolution prepared by the
Duma's international affairs committee and insisted his Liberal
Democratic Party's version be adopted instead.
	   Communist lawmakers accused him of ``rude attacks.'' ITAR-Tass
said, without specifying what thy objected to.
	   ``Such a conduct humiliates parliament deputies, and we request
the commission on ethics to consider the behavior of Vladimir
Zhirinovsky,'' the complaint says.

EU denounces media crackdown

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The current president of the European
Union council on Friday denounced the Serbian government crackdown
on independent media as ``intolerable.''
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, who currently
holds the rotating EU post, said the closing of three newspapers
and a radio station was ``apparently part of a pressure campaign
against freedom of expression in Yugoslavia.''
	   Schuessel demanded the lifting of the ban against independent
media and said he would relay those views to the Yugoslav
government through the EU special envoy on Kosovo, Wolfgang
Petritsch.

Kosovo rebel army rejects U.S.-sponsored Kosovo deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels on Friday
rejected a U.S.-brokered deal with Serbia, saying it will not end
President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown in the troubled province.
	   ``The agreement does nothing but provide Milosevic leverage to
continue with war, genocide, massacres,'' said Hashim Thaci, a
representative of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Yugoslav President Milosevic agreed to a partial withdrawal of
Serb troops from Kosovo, where he launched a seven-month crackdown
against the KLA, to allow the safe return of tens of thousands
refugees and a 2,000-strong international verification mission.
	   But the KLA wants NATO and the United Nations to force Serb
troops to withdraw ``from all positions'' where they threaten the
return of refugees and freedom of movement.
	   ``If this is not done, the UCK (KLA in Albanian) will continue
the armed struggle for freedom, independence and democracy,'' Thaci
said, reading the KLA's latest announcement.
	   Ethnic Albanian moderate political leader Ibrahim Rugova
appealed Friday for ``all Kosovars, and their political and other
groups to accept'' the OSCE monitoring force. His reference to the
``other groups'' was clearly addressed to the KLA.
	   Thaci said the KLA demands inclusion in the negotiations between
the Kosovo ethnic Albanian community and Belgrade because they are
``a crucial factor on the Albanian side.
	   ``The KLA will punish any individual or group which dares sign
an agreement contrary to the will of our people expressed in the
1991 (officially unauthorized) referendum,'' Thaci said, referring
to a vote in which Kosovo's Albanians overwhelmingly opted to
secede from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.

NATO ambassadors extend airstrike deadline to Oct. 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES more details; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; with Yugoslavia-Kosovo
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies decided Friday to
maintain the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least
Oct. 27, extending the original deadline set for Saturday morning.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible attacks, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that unacceptable numbers of Serb troops and police
remained in the province.
	   The North Atlantic Council, comprised of ambassadors from the 16
alliance nations, ``decided to maintain its readiness to launch air
operations against Yugoslavia, including the deployment of
substantial air forces in the region,'' a NATO statement said.
	   NATO officials said the decision to extend the deadline was to
register progress toward peace, while keeping up the pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``There was a broad consensus that this was too soon to release
the pressure,'' said a senior NATO diplomat on condition of
anonymity. ``This is not over.''
	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
putting the planes under NATO command ready to attack. They gave
Milosevic until Saturday morning to agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic into agreeing to reduce his forces
in Kosovo, allow international observers and NATO planes to monitor
the deal, and start peace talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in
the province.
	   NATO officials said unarmed alliance spy planes may start
flights as early as Saturday. They said NATO was consulting with
Moscow on the possible participation of Russian planes in the
observer mission.
	   Diplomats at NATO headquarters said the latest reports from
Kosovo said Milosevic was pulling troops out of Kosovo, notably the
211th Armored Brigade of the Yugoslav army and the 3rd Special
Military Police.
	   However they said too many units remained in the field,
especially several thousand special police. Under the agreement,
Milosevic is supposed to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the levels
they were at before the crackdown started in February, army units
normally based in Kosovo are supposed to return to garrison.

School textbooks often sow hatred among peoples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ People who write the textbooks used by
children to learn about their neighbors should try and stop the
hatred they have sown among the Balkans, academic experts said
Friday.
	   A group of textbook specialists meeting in this northern port
city appealed to Balkan governments for a educational agreement
that would try to teach love instead of hate, peace rather than
war.
	   They hope their conference, which ends Saturday, will lead to
the establishment of a Balkan agency to collect information on
textbooks and try to change their contents.
	   ``The aim of our research is to improve the presentation of the
international picture in history and geography textbooks,'' said
Falk Pingel, assistant director of Germany's Georg-Ekert Institute
for International Textbook Research.
	   For centuries, Balkan countries, nations and ethnic groups have
fought over language, land, religion and other minor and major
issues. In the past decade alone, examples of such hatred turned to
crisis or conflict include Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and all the
former Yugoslavia.
	   Even stable countries such as Greece and Turkey are not exempt
from age-old distrust and hatred. Turkey has been fighting Kurdish
insurgents, while disputes with Greece nearly turned to war just
two years ago.
	   ``There is one basic implication. That fighting, defeating and
being victorious in a battle and a war is a very positive
attitude,'' Pingel said.
	   But that's the wrong lesson and ``that's what we are working
for. To show that wars must be presented in another way in
textbooks. That to fight and to be brave is no longer a positive
attitude.''
	   Pingel is one of more than a dozen researchers and textbook
experts from 15 countries attending a conference on the image of
the neighbor in Balkan school textbooks.
	   A survey of textbooks from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia
and Turkey presented at the conference found that 23 percent of all
references to neighboring countries were negative, 73 percent
neutral and only three percent positive.
	   In Greek textbooks, 56.6 percent of the references to Turkey
were negative, while in Turkish textbooks, 55.5 percent of the
citations about Greeks fell under the category of ``enemies.''
	   ``The current textbook situation is not very homogeneous in the
Balkans. There are great differentiations depending on the
political development of each country,'' said German textbook
specialist Wolfgang Hopken. ``In Serbia I have not seen any
improvement in textbooks.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's president asked ex-communist Massimo D'Alema
on Friday to try to form a new governing majority, giving D'Alema
the chance to become the country's first-ever premier to emerge
from the old Communist Party.
	   If he succeeds, Italy would get its farthest left-leaning
government yet. Although D'Alema himself stands with Italy's
moderates on such matters as privatization and NATO, to secure a
majority he could have to offer Cabinet seats to the hard-core
Communists _ who oppose both and are generally anti-American.
	   Calling President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's mandate a ``great
responsibility,'' D'Alema said, ``I'll try to reduce conflicts and
not let down expectations.''
	   D'Alema leads the Democratic Left, a more moderate successor of
what until earlier in the 1990s was Italy's Communist Party, then
the biggest in the West. The Democratic Left is the largest in
Parliament and _ until a week ago _ part of the governing Olive
Tree coalition of Romano Prodi.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost the support of
Italy's diehard Communists, who said his deficit-cutting budget
didn't do enough to create jobs. Prodi admitted defeat Thursday in
efforts to piece together a new majority. His Olive Tree threw its
support to D'Alema.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of the centrists and somehow guarantee their
coexistence with his hard-line Communist allies. Many think that
could mean giving Cabinet appointments to both sides.
	   After talks with Scalfaro, centrist party leader Francesco
Cossiga said he thought the chances were good for creating a
coalition with room for both centrists and Communists, and said he
was willing to negotiate with D'Alema.
	   ``We won't rule anyone out,'' he told reporters.
	   For their part, the hard-line Communists, the Communist
Refoundation, have said they would negotiate with D'Alema only if
he agrees to changes in the budget. A breakaway faction of the
Communist Refoundation already has given him its blessing.
	   Talking to reporters after he got the nod from the president,
D'Alema insisted he would stick to the cost-cutting budget proposal
that Prodi had backed to see Italy through next year's debut of the
euro, the European common currency.
	   D'Alema also pledged to keep pushing for constitutional reform.
Under Prodi, D'Alema lost his campaign to overhaul Italy's
political system earlier this year _ the biggest defeat in the
career of D'Alema, an experienced, intelligent politician.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.
His center-left majority marked a trend toward the left in Europe;
the left later also took power in Britain, France and Germany.
	   Until the Cold War ended, one of the guiding principles of
Italy's political system was to keep the Communists out of power.
Centrist coalitions long barred the left from power, though it
controlled some regional governments and has heavy influence in
universities and cultural institutions.
	   D'Alema started his political career with local administrative
jobs with the Communist Party, then became head of the Young
Communists' Federation in 1975. He edited the party newspaper from
1988-1990 and later took over what became the Democratic Left.
	   He himself had long said that the political realities of Italy
precluded ex-communists like him from getting the country's top
job. ``Me, premier?'' he scoffed just three days ago. ``No, we
children of a lesser god are used to serving the country.''

Latin American leaders consider their economic woes at summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Castro remarks, new details, quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders flew Friday to
Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield
their economies from the global financial crisis.
	   Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in
recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's
developing economies.
	   An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the
turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue
facing the world at the moment.
	   ``I don't know if we are coming to the end of the world economic
order. It will be interesting to know,'' the Cuban leader said at a
hotel press conference shortly after his arrival for the annual
Ibero-American summit.
	   Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said President
Clinton was aware that ``if South America falls into crisis, it
will be extended inevitably also to the United States,'' which is
heavily involved in investments and loans in the region.
	   Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America
with devastating effects on stock markets and currency reserves.
	   The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and
Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial turmoil
that already has devastated Asia and Russia. Stock markets also
fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy investors in Latin America.
	   The Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular
reforms of their public finances, including austerity packages
which risk social unrest and political upheaval.
	   A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port
city on the Douro River in northern Portugal.
	   Diplomats said there was consensus on the form of the final
statement.
	   The declaration ``calls on the international community, and
Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary
measures to promote stability in international financial markets,
which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,''
said Luis Augusto Castro Neves, of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
	   Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory
system for global financial transactions that would place controls
on speculators, like measures to slow down the international flow
of money.
	   They also want reforms that allow international financial
institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with
rescue packages.
	   ``International institutions must be active in tackling crises
like the recent one ... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said.
	   ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in
reference to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their
economies.
	   Brazil, the continent's largest economy and a potential bulwark
against creeping recession, is waiting for news of a dlrs 30
billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.
	   The presidents of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development
Bank also were expected at the talks.
	   The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates
Thursday revived Latin America's financial markets, but analysts
expected the reprieve to be short-lived because of deep concerns
about the continent's economic health.
	   The recent economic troubles stemmed in part from the structural
weaknesses of Latin American economies.
	   A strike being waged by state employees in Colombia against a
government austerity package offers a glimpse of the trouble that
could arise if tough reforms are introduced.
	   Brazil is drafting an austerity package that will affect public
spending, especially social security.

Belarusian lawyer to be disbarred over U.S. trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A prominent Belarusian lawyer and human
rights activist is being disbarred because she was critical of her
government during a recent trip to the United States, the lawyer
said Friday.
	   Vera Stremkovskaya, head of the Minsk Human Rights Center, said
the deputy minister of justice, Viktor Golovanov, summoned her this
week and called her a ``fierce oppositionist'' who denounced
Belarusian laws and the constitution.
	   He said Stremkovskaya would be barred from practicing law in
this former Soviet republic.
	   Stremkovskaya acknowledged that she criticized decrees of
President Alexander Lukashenko and spoke about human rights
violations in Belarus during her trip. Lukashenko tolerates little
dissent and has cracked down on his opponents, including many human
rights activists.
	   ``This is an example of persecution for my convictions. This is
a direct violation of my rights in the Belarusian Constitution,''
Stremkovskaya told The Associated Press on Friday.
	   Stremkovskaya said she has also been barred from traveling to
Prague for a conference that begins Monday.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted Friday to
select three judges to fill a new trial chamber of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, whose caseload is expected to grow with atrocities
committed during the Kosovo conflict.
	   Representatives of the 185-member assembly cast secret ballots
to choose among candidates nominated by their home countries. The
three will rule on cases concerning crimes committed in the former
Yugoslavia. Their terms will end Nov. 16, 2001.
	   David Anthony Hunt of Australia and Patrick Lipton Robinson of
Jamaica received more than the 94 votes needed for a majority after
two rounds of balloting. A third round did not produce a selection.
A fourth round was scheduled to choose between the remaining
candidates, Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco and Peter H. Wilkitzki of
Germany.
	   Poland, Ecuador, Finland, Sri Lanka and Chile withdrew their
candidates to make a final result easier.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish museum agreed to pay an art
dealer 250,000 kronor (dlrs 40,850) to buy a tuna fish-size can
filled with excrement that started leaking after it was borrowed
for an exhibit, both sides announced.
	   The settlement ends legal wrangling between Randers Arts Museum,
which borrowed the Italian artistic endeavor and dealer John Hunov,
who lent it.
	   The contents came from Piero Manzoni (1933-1963), who reportedly
filled about 90 cans of similar size with his excrement in 1961.
	   ``It was made in the 1960s as a provocation to the snobbishness
in the art world,'' museum director Finn Terman Frederiksen said in
a telephone interview Friday, the day after the settlement was
publicly disclosed.
	   ``He is giving us an ironic comment on the innermost of the
artist,'' he added.
	   The can was borrowed four years ago for an exhibit on Manzoni's
work. Hunov claimed it was damaged by exposure to strong sunlight
and the museum did not take proper precautions during transport.
	   Frederiksen said the leakage probably was due to the interaction
of the can and its contents. At first, the museum refused to pay
compensation.
	   ``It's a very special situation where a piece of art has a
built-in, self-dissolving mechanism,'' he told the Copenhagen
newspaper Politiken. ``We couldn't foresee that the can would start
leaking just as it was borrowed by us.''
	   The museum's intention is to seal the can and put it back on
display, hopefully by next year, he said.
	   Randers is a small museum located 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northwest of Copenhagen.

Woods wins playoff; Vijay Singh, O'Meara, Westwood also advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs: RECASTS throughout, adds Woods quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Although Tiger Woods was fighting
the flu and a sore throat, it was Ian Woosnam who coughed up their
Friday quarterfinal at the World Match Play Championship.
	   Woosnam missed four-foot (one-meter) putts on the 34th and 36th
holes _ either would have won it _ and then bogeyed the first
sudden-death playoff hole as Woods won 1-up.
	   In the other quarterfinals in the 36-hole-daily event, defending
champion Vijay Singh of Fiji defeated Sweden's Patrik Sjoland 7 and
6, American Mark O'Meara rallied to beat Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4,
and Lee Westwood defeated three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1.
	   Singh faces O'Meara in Saturday's semifinals and Westwood and
Woods play in the other.
	   Westwood's game has been by far the best in the field, shooting
21-under for two days (64 holes). And Singh, who shot 10-under 62
in Friday's first round to equal a tournament record, isn't far
behind.
	   But for drama _ and the focus of a record-17,950 on a misty,
gray day at the Wentworth Club _ Woods and Woosnam were the show
despite pedestrian rounds.
	   ``I tried to just grind it out on each and every hole,'' said
Woods, who's fighting the bug since arriving in damp Britain for
last week's Dunhill Cup.
	   ``Whether you're sick or not you have to do that. I think
because I was under the weather I was even more aware of that than
normal and tried to concentrate more.''
	   ``The coughing was the main thing,'' added Woods, who also had
to fight off a bloody, irritated nose for a few holes. ``Just
trying not to cough when Ian was playing. When I tired to hold my
cough I started to tear up.''
	   Woosnam, up by one after the first 18, fell two behind but
rallied to square on the 29th when Woods three-putted. He won the
next hole when the American drove his second shot out of bounds.
	   Woosnam went two up with a six-foot (two-meter) birdie putt on
the 33rd, but Woods rallied to one down when Woosnam three-putted
the 34th, missing a four-footer (one meter) to win.
	   On the 35th, he dropped a 16-foot (five-meter) putt to halve,
but on 36th his short putt to win lipped out.
	   ``Lucky escape, no doubt about it,'' Woods admitted. ``I got a
lucky break when he ran it by and then lipped it out.''
	   The 25-year-old Westwood, who has a chance early next month to
dethrone Montgomerie as the European money champion, led by three
after 18.
	   Els _ in the finals the last four years, winning three _ won the
first four holes on the second 18 to take a two-hole lead, but
Westwood rallied as Els bogeyed the 29th. He squared on the 30th
when he hit a 236-yard 3-wood to two feet (half meter) for an
eagle.
	   He then birdied the 31st to go one up and went two up with
another birdie on 34.
	   ``I shot so well on the first 18 (65), but I must have eaten
something dodgy for lunch the way Ernie came out,'' Westwood said.
	   ``The eagle at 12 (30th overall) was obviously very important
and one of the best shots I've hit in a long time.''
	   Singh, the winner of the U.S. PGA, led by 11 holes after 21 and
was on track to administer the worst defeat in 34-year-old
tournament's history, but Sjoland briefly staved off the loss.
	   ``Seve (Ballesteros) once told me, if you're 10 up _ go for
11,'' Singh said. ``But when you're that far ahead it's tough to
keep going.''
	   ``It's fun to play when you're playing that good,'' he added.
``I haven't played that good in a long time. If I keep doing that,
I have a good chance of going all the way through.''
	   Sjoland was more to the point. ``The way he played was just
amazing.''
	   O'Meara, the Masters and British Open champion, trailed by three
holes after 15, but then won nine of the next 13 to take a six-hole
lead on Montgomerie after 28. He closed him out on the 32nd when
they halved the hole.
	   O'Meara had six birdies and an eagle in his comeback stretch.
The eagle came on the par-5 18th when he dropped a 50-foot
(15-meter) putt.
	   ``When I was three down (after 15) I got mad at myself and said
I was going to birdie the next three. I didn't, but I got a birdie
and that eagle for a boost.''
	   Montgomerie, making his seventh appearance, attributed his day
to poor shots to poor driver play, unusual for one of golf's
straightest shooters.
	   ``He really didn't look that confident with his driver,''
O'Meara said. ``He never looked that confident over the ball.''

Northern Irish leader downplays his role in peace agreement

	   DENVER (AP) _ For Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble it
was still a business trip, even after receiving word he would share
a Nobel Peace Prize with his Catholic counterpart, John Hume.
	   Repeatedly pressed to show some sign of celebration he barely
smiled and admonished reporters: ``Don't personalize this.''
	   Trimble, 54, added, in a brief streetside pre-dawn chat outside
the Brown Palace Hotel, ``I hope this award doesn't turn out to be
premature. ... We cannot say with absolute certainty that there is
peace in Northern Ireland.''
	   Trimble did manage a grin when Jim Lyons, a Denver lawyer who is
a special adviser to President Bill Clinton, met him outside an
elevator and said: ``I told you if you came to Denver you wouldn't
be disappointed.''
	   He said the credit should go to the two parties that negotiated
the peace agreement, the Protestant-based Ulster Unionists and
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party. ``It is an endorsement
for all of the people who helped produce the agreement.''
	   He said the two parties ``have always been the center of gravity
of this process.'' He made no reference to Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army that some had expected to share
in the prize if it was awarded to Irish leaders.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited Trimble and Hume for work
toward ending ``the national religious and social conflict in
Northern Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   The work of the two men resulted in a peace agreement ratified
by voters this spring.
	   Trimble, first minister of Northern Ireland, then headed for a
scheduled meeting with business leaders his government wants to
invest in the country.
	   Trimble said his message is that Northern Ireland ``has new
management elected by the people.''
	   He was in Denver on the fifth stop of an 11-city tour to promote
investment.
	   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Catholic Social Democrats,
could barely contain his glee over the award to his boss, Hume. He
also said he never lost faith the agreement would succeed, even
after a splinter IRA group was blamed for a bombing that claimed 29
lives in Omagh in August.
	   ``I'm a betting man and I had a bet that the voters would ratify
the agreement. And I had a bet that Mr. Hume would win the Nobel
Prize,'' he said.

 &UR; Northern Ireland leaders win joint Peace Prize for Belfast accord &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMs, new throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble,
joint winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, have traveled
dramatically different roads as brokers of the historic Northern
Ireland accord.
	   For Hume, 61, the single-minded peacemaker who leads the
province's major Catholic party, Friday's honor from the Norwegian
Nobel Committee caps a remarkable career that culminated in an
agreement he envisioned decades ago.
	   For Trimble, 54, embattled chief of the Protestant party pivotal
to the peacemaking efforts, the Nobel was unexpected and more
controversial _ particularly considering the omission of his
nemesis, Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   The Oslo Nobel judges previously have used their award to
encourage progress in peacemaking _ most notably in the Middle
East, where Israel's Menachim Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat shared
honors in 1978, and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat joined Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres in 1994.
	   It also has gone to Northern Ireland before _ in 1976, early in
the British province's three decades of strife, it was won by two
women who founded a peace group.
	   Although Hume and Trimble are not friends and their relations
are cool, their work culminated in an agreement ratified by voters
this spring that sets up a new Protestant-Catholic power-sharing
governing structure.
	   Friday's citation _ accompanied by dlrs 963,000, which will be
divided equally between the two men _ credited them for work toward
ending ``the national, religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Of Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, the citation said
he showed ``great political courage when, at a critical stage in
the process, he advocated solutions which led to the peace
agreement.''
	   That included remaining in negotiations when Sinn Fein gained
admission following the Irish Republican Army's 1997 cease-fire,
and agreeing to a deal that would free more than 200 IRA prisoners
without a cast-iron guarantee that the IRA would start disarming.
	   Of Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the
citation said he had ``throughout been the clearest and most
consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for
a peaceful solution.''
	   Hume rose to prominence as a 1960s leader of non-violent
Catholic protests for equal rights in what was then a
Protestant-ruled state. From 1970 onwards, he did more than anyone
else to minimize Catholic support for IRA violence, which he argued
only compounded social divisions.
	   Most critically, he weathered huge personal criticism in 1993 by
seeking common ground with Adams, a groundbreaking initiative that
encouraged the IRA's cease-fires and made Hume _ not Adams _
Northern Ireland's most likely Nobel laureate.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton saluted Trimble's
``rare courage,'' but emphasized that other figures ``deserve
credit for their indispensable roles, beginning with Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein leader without whom there would have been no peace.''
	   Clinton also praised former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who
chaired the peace talks.
	   While the Nobel committee noted that April's peace agreement
also was the work of the governments of the United Kingdom, Ireland
and the United States, it did not include any reference to
Mitchell.
	   The Nobel recognized Trimble's risky struggle _ successful so
far _ to keep a slim majority of the north's British Protestants
supporting a peace process that he himself frequently criticized as
offering too many concessions to Sinn Fein and the IRA.
	   ``I hope very much that this award doesn't turn out to be
premature,'' Trimble cautioned in the Colorado capital of Denver,
his latest stop in a week-long push to attract more North American
investment to Northern Ireland.
	   As a young Ulster Unionist, Trimble helped topple the party's
leaders when they tried to govern in coalition with Hume's party in
1973. Today, he must overcome that same reluctance among
Protestants to share power _ not only with Hume but also Sinn Fein,
which until recently denied Northern Ireland's very right to exist.
	   Speaking in Belfast, Hume said Friday's honor represented ``very
powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern
Ireland.''
	   ``I think that today's announcement from the Nobel committee
strengthens our peace process enormously because it tells all the
people what the world wants to see on our streets,'' he said.
	   In New York, Adams _ embroiled in a dangerous showdown with
Trimble over how the peace agreement should proceed _ said he was
not disappointed about his lack of recognition, and voiced pleasure
at Hume's recognition.
	   ``I suppose, you know, the big prize is the peace settlement,
and that's the prize for us all to keep our eye on,'' Adams said.
``The Nobel Peace Prize is only important insofar as it aids the
road and the quest for that bigger prize.''
	   Asked if the committee has shunned Adams because of the IRA's
terrorist history, Francis Sejersted, the Nobel chairman, refused
to discuss the deliberations.
	   ``I can only repeat that many people have contributed to this
process, not in the least Gerry Adams,'' he said.
	   Sejersted said the committee knew that setbacks and renewed
violence still are possible in Northern Ireland, but said the peace
agreement ``indicates that the process is going in on the right
track. We wanted to give it a push.''
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Police arrest suspects in ritual killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula have
arrested several people suspected of being involved in ritual
killings, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Friday.
	   Investigators believe they are members of a satanic cult,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting the Crimean prosecutor's office.
	   It said the suspects were originally arrested in connection with
an assault on a watchman at a theater in the Crimean capital,
Simferopol. A search of one of the suspect's apartments turned up a
human skull coated with varnish.
	   The 19-year-old suspect confessed the skull belonged to one of
the cult's victims, ITAR-Tass said. It said he gave details of a
similar ritual killing in the summer in which the cult members
strangled a 14-year-old girl and cut off her head and boiled it.

Guyana reaches 237 against Barbados
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A superb century innings from
Shivnarine Chanderpaul spurred Guyana to a challenging 237 runs for
eight wickets against Barbados in their Red Stripe Bowl semifinal
match at Kaiser Sports Club.
	   Guyana, the most consistent one-day team in regional cricket,
recovered from a disastrous start to place themselves in a
competitive position to push for victory.
	   That didn't seem possible early in their innings when, after
winning the toss and electing to bat, they lost the first three
wickets with only six runs on the board. West Indies opener Clayton
Lambert, Andrew Gonzalves and Keith Semple were all back in the
pavilion with only six overs bowled.
	   The usually sedate Chanderpaul then dominated a third wicket
stand of 60 with Nicholas DeGroot before the latter was out for a
painstaking six in the 14th over.
	   Chanderpaul and his captain, Carl Hooper, took control with a
fourth wicket stand of 122. The left-handed Chanderpaul reached 50
off only 38 deliveries with two sixes and nine boundaries.
	   His innings slowed as he approached his first Red Stripe Bowl
century which came in the 37th over off 186 deliveries. Dropped in
the 40th over on 108, Chanderpaul was sixth out in the 45th over,
bowled by seam bowler Henderson Bryan for 109.
	   Hooper's innings of 78, a mixture of solid defense and
aggression, came off 124 deliveries and he struck seven boundaries
before he was fifth out.
	   Once Hooper and Chanderpaul were out within two overs of each
other, the Guyana innings went into decline with the last six
wickets realizing 59 runs.

NATO ambassadors extend airstrike deadline to Oct. 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more details; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO allies decided Friday to maintain
the threat of airstrikes against Serbia until at least Oct. 27,
extending the original deadline set for Saturday morning.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the allied strike
force of some 400 warplanes ready for possible attacks, despite the
Kosovo peace deal struck this week with the Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, adding the alliance had ``clear
evidence'' that unacceptable numbers of Serb troops and police
remained in the secessionist province, which is mostly populated by
ethnic Albanians.
	   The North Atlantic Council, comprised of ambassadors from the 16
alliance nations, ``decided to maintain its readiness to launch air
operations against Yugoslavia, including the deployment of
substantial air forces in the region,'' a NATO statement said.
	   NATO officials said the decision to extend the deadline was to
register progress toward peace, while keeping up the pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   One senior diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was broad consensus that this was too soon to release the
pressure.
	   On Tuesday, allied nations issued an ``activation order''
readying planes under NATO command for attack. They gave Milosevic
until Saturday morning to agree a peace deal.
	   The threat pushed Milosevic into agreeing to reduce his forces
in Kosovo, allow international observers and NATO planes to monitor
the deal, and start peace talks with ethnic Albanian separatists in
the province.
	   NATO officials said unarmed alliance spy planes may start
flights as early as Saturday. They said NATO was consulting with
Moscow on the possible participation of Russian planes in the
observer mission.
	   Diplomats at NATO headquarters said the latest reports from
Kosovo said Milosevic was pulling troops out of Kosovo, notably the
211th Armored Brigade of the Yugoslav army and the 3rd Special
Military Police.
	   However they said too many units remained in the field,
especially several thousand special police. Under the agreement,
Milosevic is supposed to reduce his forces in Kosovo to the levels
they were at before the crackdown against ethnic Albanian rebels
started in February. Army units normally based in Kosovo are
supposed to return to their garrisons.

Williams serves fastest ace, reaches semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Williams/Pierce, will be UPDATED with
detail, background, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Venus Williams sealed a
quarterfinal victory Friday with the fastest serve in the history
of women's tennis, securing herself a berth in the semifinals of
the European Championships.
	   At an incredible 205 km/hour (127.4 miles/hour), Williams' serve
whizzed by almost unseen seventh-seed Mary Pierce, closing out the
match 6-4, 6-1.
	   In earlier quarterfinal play, new world No. 1 American Lindsay
Davenport lived up to her new status, annihilating sixth-seed
Amanda Coetzer for her place in the semifinals.
	   The 22-year-old defending champion breezed past the world No.13,
dispatching Coetzer 6-3, 6-1 in just 58 minutes for her seventh
straight victory over the South African.
	   But for a short while the world's top player was overshadowed by
the world's fastest server, with Williams turning some of the
uncomfortable media attention off Davenport and onto herself.
	   ``That's something, that's crazy,'' said Williams, whose
previous record was a stunning 201 km/hr (125 miles/hr). ``I looked
over at my sister Serena right away because both of us are trying
to get the faster serve.
	   ``I hit that ball perfectly. It was great timing and technique.
	   ``It'll be awhile before I can get it faster, maybe the
Australian Open.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's president asked ex-communist Massimo D'Alema
on Friday to try to form a new governing majority, giving him the
chance to become the country's first-ever premier to emerge from
the old Communist Party.
	   If D'Alema succeeds, Italy would get its farthest left-leaning
government yet. Although he himself stands with Italy's moderates
on such matters as privatization and NATO, to secure a majority he
might have to offer Cabinet seats to the Communists _ who oppose
both.
	   The leader of one Communist faction said he was open to a
D'Alema government, as did the leader of a key centrist party. What
the centrist party leader was signaling, D'Alema declared, was that
``The Cold War is over in this country.''
	   Calling President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's mandate a ``great
responsibility,'' D'Alema said, ``I'll try to reduce conflicts and
not let down expectations.''
	   D'Alema leads the Democratic Left, a more moderate successor of
what until earlier in the 1990s was Italy's Communist Party, then
the biggest in the West. The Democratic Left is the largest in
Parliament and _ up to a week ago _ part of the governing coalition
of Romano Prodi.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell after it lost the support of
hard-line Communists, who complained his budget for next year
didn't do enough to create jobs.
	   Prodi admitted defeat Thursday in efforts to piece together a
new majority. His coalition threw its support to D'Alema.
	   D'Alema's chances, like Prodi's, will depend on his ability to
win the backing of the centrists and somehow guarantee their
coexistence with his Communist allies. Many think that could mean
giving Cabinet appointments to both sides.
	   Talking to reporters after he got the nod from the president,
D'Alema insisted he would stick to the cost-cutting budget that
Prodi had drafted to see Italy through next year's debut of the
euro, the European common currency.
	   D'Alema also pledged to keep pushing for constitutional reform.
Under Prodi, D'Alema lost his campaign to overhaul Italy's
political system earlier this year _ the biggest defeat in the
career of D'Alema, an experienced, intelligent politician.
	   Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had been the
second-longest-lived of Italy's 55 governments since World War II.
His center-left majority marked a trend toward the left in Europe;
the left later also took power in Britain, France and Germany.
	   Until the Cold War ended, one of the guiding principles of
Italy's political system was to keep the Communists out of power.
Centrist coalitions long barred the left from power, though it
controlled some regional governments and has heavy influence in
universities and cultural institutions.
	   D'Alema started his political career with the Communist Party,
becoming head of the Young Communists' Federation in 1975. He later
took over what became the Democratic Left.
	   He himself had long said that the political realities of Italy
precluded ex-communists like him from getting the country's top
job.
	   ``Me, premier?'' he scoffed just three days ago. ``No, we
children of a lesser god are used to serving the country.''

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble,
joint winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, have traveled
dramatically different roads as brokers of the historic Northern
Ireland accord.
	   For Hume, 61, the single-minded peacemaker who leads the
province's major Catholic party, Friday's honor from the Norwegian
Nobel Committee capped a remarkable career that culminated in an
agreement he envisioned decades ago.
	   For Trimble, 54, embattled chief of the Protestant party pivotal
to the peacemaking efforts, the Nobel was more controversial _
particularly considering the omission of his nemesis, Gerry Adams,
leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.

Sampras, as expected, moves into semifinals at ease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seed Pete Sampras took a mere 57
minutes to overpower unseeded Tim Henman 6-0, 6-3 Friday and
advance at ease into the semifinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy
ATP tennis tournament.
	   The American, who attends the Vienna competition for the first
time, was the clear favorite to win the title.
	   ``You never know how you're gonna play,'' Sampras said after his
win, but ``my game just clicked today. I couldn't have played any
better.''
	   Sampras lauded Henman despite his clear defeat. ``Tim represents
the next generation of players,'' he said. ``He will be a
consistent top player as long as he wants to.''
	   Henman joked afterward saying, ``I played great _ the first
point.''
	   ``But I cannot complain really, because you are going to have a
bad match from time to time. I've had like 21 or 22 good matches in
a row.''
	   Sampras, an eleven-time Grand Slam winner, even compared his
performance with that in Hanover last year when he became ATP World
Champion. But he added, ``Tomorrow things may look quite
different'' when he meets fellow-American Todd Martin, who ousted
Cedric Pioline 6-4, 6-3 in another quarterfinal clash.
	   Earlier in the day, fifth-seed Karol Kucera eliminated Jonas
Bjoerkman of Sweden in 69 minutes 6-3, 6-2.
	   For the 24-year-old Slovak it was an important step toward
first-time qualification for the ATP World Championship in Hanover.
Early this week, in an intermediate ranking, Kucera was in eighth
spot.
	   Kucera has steadily risen in ATP rankings since former top
player Miloslav Mecir took care of the young Slovak hopeful. ``I
like to work with him, he was always one of my idols, like (Ivan)
Lendl or (Stefan) Edberg.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO extended its deadline to strike
against Yugoslavia, as President Slobodan Milosevic took another
step Friday to comply with international demands by allowing 2,000
foreign monitors into his troubled province.
	   NATO extended Saturday's deadline for Yugoslavia to come into
compliance with terms of a peace deal on Kosovo until Oct. 27. The
Alliance wanted to keep the force of about 400 warplanes ready for
possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo deal struck this week
between Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that unacceptable Serb troops and police
remained in the province.
	   In Belgrade, the government signed a deal with the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow 2,000
OSCE ``verifiers'' to monitor Milosevic's pledge to withdraw his
troops and allow the return of tens of thousands of refugees.
	   And in another sign that Milosevic was reacting to NATO
pressure, there were reports of a major withdrawal of Serb-led
security troops from Kosovo Friday afternoon.
	   ``This is only the first step,'' OSCE chairman Bronislaw
Geremek, Poland's foreign minister, said after signing the
verification agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic.
	   Under the agreement, the unarmed monitors will be allowed to
roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn the additional
troops and to reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it is safe to
return home.
	   However, NATO has doubts whether Milosevic will stick to the
deal and ambassadors from the allied nations decided to extend
rather than lift the deadline.
	   NATO spy planes will begin flying over Kosovo shortly under an
agreement signed late Thursday by NATO's supreme allied commander
for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The U2 spy planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this
weekend. Jetfighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy
planes are threatened, NATO sources said in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity.
	   That will help NATO determine Milosevic's compliance even before
the monitors start their work on the ground.
	   Geremek said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the
unarmed force and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he
had received promises from member countries for about 800
volunteers, although he did not say how long it would take to
train, equip and station them in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with the main ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, Geremek said in Kosovo's capital Pristina: ``I have
received assurances from Mr. Rugova about his participation in the
peace process.''
	   Rugova said, ``I believe that we can assure that everybody will
take part in this agreement and cooperate with the OSCE mission.
The people of Kosovo are interested in an international presence
that will protect them.''
	   But the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army issued a
statement later in the day, saying it rejects the U.S.-brokered
deal for the strife-torn province.
	   Hashim Thaci, a member of the KLA's political wing, told The
Associated Press that NATO and the U.N. have to force Serb troops
to withdraw ``from all positions'' from where they threaten the
return of refugees and the freedom of movement.
	   ``If this is not done, the KLA will continue the armed struggle
for freedom, independence and democracy,'' Thaci said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush the KLA. Its soldiers have
killed more than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic
Albanians loyal to Milosevic's government.
	   According to Serb sources, a policeman was killed Thursday
evening near the town of Orahovac, some 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, said that Serb
police had killed one Albanian and wounded another Thursday.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, and most of them favor independence or substantial
self-rule. The United States has been spearheading international
efforts to revive negotiations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose the militants'
demand for independence, fearing this could lead to further
instability among ethnic Albanian communities throughout the
southern Balkans.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   Aid workers said there is enough food and other supplies to
sustain the scattered population during the winter if they can
return to their homes, but meeting medical needs will be a
difficult challenge.

U.N. envoy begins shuttle diplomacy on divided Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with next week's war games; No Pickup

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The U.N. representative in Cyprus opened
meetings Friday with leaders of the estranged Greek and Turkish
communities in a bid to reunite the divided island.
	   Ann Hercus is trying to restart direct negotiations to end the
unofficial division of Cyprus since the 1974 Turkish invasion and
subsequent occupation of the northern third of the Mediterranean
island.
	   The invasion was in response to a coup inspired by the Greek
military to unite Cyprus with Greece. The island's two communities
have lived apart since then on either sides of a ``green line,''
which is policed by a U.N. force.
	   Hercus met President Glafcos Clerides in Nicosia and said she
would meet with Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Wednesday,
and was due to meet Clerides again next week. She gave no details
about her talks with Clerides.
	   U.N.-sponsored negotiations last year failed to narrow
differences between Clerides and Denktash.
	   The Turkish Cypriot leader said he had no wish to resume talks
unless the Greek Cypriots, whose government is internationally
recognized, withdraws its bid to join the European Union. He has
also demanded the recognition of the self-declared Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus.
	   Clerides, whose government began membership talks with the EU in
March, has rejected both conditions.
	   The start of the talks coincided with an announcement by a Greek
Cypriot general that Greek air, ground and naval forces would take
part in war games scheduled to begin in Cyprus next week.
	   Although allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Greece and Turkey have a rivalry going back centuries and both are
committed to the defense of their fellow communities on Cyprus.

Williams serves fastest ace, reaches semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Williams-Pierce, will be UPDATED with
detail, background, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Venus Williams unleashed the fastest
serve in women's tennis _ 205 kph (127 mph) _ on Friday, using it
to whip seventh-seeded Mary Pierce 6-4, 6-1 in the quarterfinals of
the European Championships.
	   Earlier, American Lindsay Davenport lived up to her new status
as the No. 1-ranked woman, routing sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer 6-3,
6-1 in only 58 minutes for her seventh straight victory over the
South African and a place in the semifinals.
	   But for a short while the world's top player was overshadowed by
Williams, who beat her previous fastest servy by 4 kph (2 mph).
	   ``That's something, that's crazy,'' Williams said. ``I looked
over at my sister Serena right away because both of us are trying
to get the faster serve.
	   ``I hit that ball perfectly. It was great timing and technique.
	   ``It'll be awhile before I can get it faster, maybe the
Australian Open.''
	   Williams' victory put her into the semifinals against the winner
of the match between fourth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat of France and
Austria's Barbara Schett, who played later Friday.
	   In the other semifinal, Davenport will face Romania's Irina
Spirlea, who need only 53 minutes tampled eighth-seeded Dominique
Van Roost of Belgium 6-4, 6-0.
	   Despite winning five titles this season, Davenport says the
added crown of the No. 1 ranking has added some unwanted pressure.
	   ``There's pressure to defend the points, to defend the title,
and to try not to let the lead go,'' said Davenport, who officially
passed Martina Hingis as No. 1 on Monday. ``Hopefully you don't put
too much pressure on yourself and say `you've got to win the
tournament now that you're one.'
	   ``You mustn't think `I'm No. 1, I've got to win,' or `I can't
lose to this person, I'm No. 1,' because it would all fall apart,''
the U.S. Open champion said. ``Inevitably now when I lose, I'll
lose to someone ranked below me.''
	   There was little sign that Davenport's new status was rattling
her Friday. In fact, it was Coetzer who appeared to crumble,
holding serve just once in the entire match.
	   Getting off to a forceful start, Davenport broke the South
African teice to jump to a 3-0 lead.
	   But taking advantage of a dip in Davenport's focus, a scrappy
Coetzer rallied to break back twice and even the score.
	   The comeback seemed to rekindle Davenport's zeal, the American
winning the next three games to take the set.
	   Davenport continued her domination in the second set, winning
the first four games before Coetzer was able to break the American
once to somewhat narrow the gap.
	   Coetzer's defiance was short-lived, however, as Davenport broke
right back, winning the next two games to wrap up the match.
	   ``I lost my concentration and missed a few easy balls,'' said
Davenport, who has lost just one set in her last seven matches
against Coetzer. ``But once I won that next game and went up
another break that was the turning point.
	   ``I probably shouldn't have let it get to that point, but for
the rest I played pretty well.''
	   The victory extended Davenport's five-year winning streak in
Switzerland to 14 victories.
	   Her run began at the 1993 European Open in Lucerne, where she
captured her first career title at the age of 16. Davenport went on
to defend that title in 1994 before winning in Zurich last year.

Settlers block road after incident with Palestinian police

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede for AM's, UPDATES with settler protest outside of

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Angry Jewish settlers blocked the
West Bank's north-south highway Friday and others burned tires
after complaining that Palestinian police had detained, beaten and
fired on two of their security officers.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held, but denied they were roughed up.
	   In Friday's protest, about 100 settlers, including children,
laid an electricity pole across the highway to block traffic.
Settlers sat on the pole and on boulders on the side of the road,
reading from the Torah. Israeli troops directed motorists to an
alternate route to avoid a traffic jam.
	   After about an hour, the protesters dispersed.
	   Later Friday some 50 settlers staged a protest on the road
outside of the West Bank settlement of Ofra near Ramallah, burning
tires and briefly blocking traffic, police spokesman Ofer Sivan
said.
	   The confrontation began Thursday evening when the security chief
for nearby Jewish settlements and his deputy were patrolling the
West Bank's north-south highway after repeated incidents of
rock-throwing by Palestinians, according to a settler statement.
	   The security officers' car was hit by rocks from a Palestinian
car, the statement said. The two Israelis chased the car into the
Palestinian-run town of Ramallah, where, they said, the attackers
escaped into the residence of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The settlers said Abbas' guards stopped the Israeli car, pulled
out the two security guards, confiscated their weapons and
equipment, beat them and fired on them. Later they were taken to
the joint Israeli-Palestinian regional office and released.
	   The Palestinian security officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Israeli vehicle was stopped near Abbas' house
because it appeared suspicious. The officer said the joint command
was called, and its officers escorted the Israelis out.
	   In the West Bank's Gush Etzion settlement bloc south of
Jerusalem, shots were fired from a Palestinian village at a guard
post near an Israeli settlement on Thursday night, Israel radio
reported. No one was injured.
	   Settler leaders are in Washington to accompany the summit
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They briefed one of Netanyahu's
aides about the incident, and advised against handing more
territory over to Arafat under the circumstances.
	   Late Thursday night, Netanyahu aides at the summit telephoned
high ranking army officers in the West Bank and told them that
action should be taken against the Palestinian policemen involved
in the incident and that the security guards' equipment should be
returned to them, Army Radio reported.
	   About 160,000 settlers live in the West Bank, among more than
1.5 million Palestinians. The settlers charge that any agreement to
transfer territory to the Palestinians would endanger their
security. Palestinians charge that armed settlers harass and
threaten them.

Iraqi-appointed leader of Kuwait is said to have defected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Kuwaiti officer who was appointed prime
minister after Iraq's invasion in 1990 has defected to a European
country, an Iraqi dissident group said Friday.
	   Col. Alaa Hussein Ali has arrived in a European country after
being granted refugee status by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Turkey, said an official of the London-based Iraqi
National Congress.
	   The official refused to reveal the country in a telephone
interview from his office in London.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. A UNHCR
spokesman in Ankara said the agency's confidentiality rule barred
him from discussing individual cases.
	   Alaa was an obscure lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army when Iraqi
forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 1990. He was summoned to Baghdad,
promoted to colonel, and named as prime minister of a 9-member
``Provisional Kuwait Free Government.''
	   Alaa had studied management at Baghdad university and was a
member of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, the dissident group's radio,
Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., said in a statement received in Cairo.
	   One week after the invasion, Alaa was seen on Iraqi television
asking President Saddam Hussein to unite Kuwait with its big
neighbor. Hours later Baghdad announced that Iraq had annexed
Kuwait and Alaa disappeared from public view.
	   The radio called Alaa ``the Quisling head of Saddam's puppet
government'' after the Norwegian officer who supported the German
invasion of Norway in 1940 and was appointed ruler.
	   The radio said Alaa left Iraq via Jordan and arrived in Turkey
on Aug. 13, accompanied by his wife and four children.
	   Alaa had been trying to defect since 1994, but was refused
permission to leave Iraq, the Iraqi National Congress official
said.
	   ``Lately he told them (Iraqi authorities) that he wanted to
visit his parents in Amman (Jordan) because they were sick,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Alaa was then granted permission and entered Jordan on an Iraqi
passport, the official said.
	   The UNHCR arranged his resettlement in a European country, the
official added.
	   Alaa has nine sisters and brothers living in Kuwait, the radio
said.

 &UR; Solution near for South America's war-threatening border dispute &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with President Frei predicting quick solution, RECASTS
throughout to add background &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Three Latin American presidents and a
special envoy from the United States will start hammering out a
peace agreement this weekend to try to end the region's last
remaining war-threatening border dispute.
	   ``A definite solution is now very near,'' Chilean President
Eduardo Frei said at a press briefing here Friday. His country is
one of four guarantor nations to a 1942 treaty that ended a war
between Peru and Ecuador, but failed to satisfy a dispute over a
short section of their jungle border.
	   Presidents of three of the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile and
Argentina _ expected in Oporto for Sunday's Ibero-American Summit _
agreed to meet Saturday, Frei said. They are expected to be joined
by special U.S. envoy Luigi Einaudi.
	   An Argentine diplomat involved in the process predicted success
within days.
	   The 57-year-old dispute has erupted in war between Ecuador and
Peru three times, most recently in 1995. Tensions flared again in
August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of entering its
territory.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
area.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador
met with President Clinton in Washington earlier this month and got
his promise to help find a solution to the dispute. They told him
they had made substantial progress toward completing a peace
agreement, but remained at odds over delineating the actual border
area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   Hopes for a quick solution came Friday when legislators in Peru
and Ecuador approved proposals from their respective presidents to
accept any peace plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   The legislation meant that the four countries can impose a final
solution on the two Andean nations.
	   ``I don't see how it could fail now,'' said Alfredo Chiaradia,
Argentine under secretary of Latin American Affairs, who is
directly involved in the negotiations.
	   ``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a
proposal that implies the signing of a peace accord,'' Chiaradia
said.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

Lesotho agreement shaken by military arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Lesotho's government on Friday rejected
an opposition plea to release 30 rebel soldiers from arrest, saying
they must face mutiny charges.
	   The dispute shook confidence in a long-sought agreement reached
this week that to settle nearly three months of upheaval in this
tiny mountain kingdom surrounded by South Africa.
	   ``This is a legal process, therefore the government cannot
intervene as it wants the law to take its course,'' said Deputy
Prime Minister Kelebone Maope, who met with the opposition alliance
in Maseru.
	   The soldiers arrested Thursday could be charged with treason for
overthrowing the military leadership in September. The charge
carries the death penalty.
	   Opposition leaders repeated charges that the arrests represented
a betrayal of the agreement. They said the 30 were among 1,500
rebel soldiers who had returned to their bases earlier this week
under assurances that nothing would happen to them.
	   ``This unwarranted somersaulting by the government is the surest
way of planting the seeds of destruction in the midst of this very
young and delicate process towards the establishment of peace,
stability and ... reconciliation,'' said Vincent Malebo, an
opposition leader.
	   On Wednesday, government and opposition parties agreed to set up
a special body to prepare for new elections.
	   The group was to create the basis for free and fair elections
within 18 months and help normalize the security situation.
	   Party tensions have been running high since the May elections,
which opposition groups claim were rigged.
	   After the army revolt and crippling strikes, South Africa and
nearby Botswana on Sept. 22 sent about 1,000 troops into the
country to restore calm. South Africa expected to establish order
quickly and leave, but scores were killed and its soldiers remain
in Lesotho.
	   To restore damage from the upheavals, international economic
delegations have been consulting with the government. They include
the U.N. Development Program, the International Monetary Fund and
the Southern African Development Community.

U.N. envoy begins shuttle diplomacy on divided Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES Greek planes might use base graf 9; No Pickup

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The U.N.'s resident representative in
Cyprus started on Friday a series of meeting with leaders of the
estranged Greek and Turkish communities in the U.N.'s latest bid to
reunite this war-divided island.
	   Ann Hercus met President Glafcos Clerides in Nicosia and said
she would meet with Turkish-Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Wednesday in the Turkish-occupied part of the capital.
	   Hercus, from New Zealand, said she was due to meet Clerides
again next Thursday, but revealed nothing on the substance of her
talks with Clerides.
	   The shuttle diplomacy is aimed at finding sufficient common
ground to restart direct negotiations to end the unofficial
division of Cyprus caused by Turkey's 1974 invasion and the
subsequent occupation of the northern third of the Mediterranean
island.
	   The invasion was in response to a coup inspired by the Greek
military to unite Cyprus with Greece. The island's two communities
have lived apart since then on either sides of a ``green line,''
which is policed by a U.N. force.
	   Clerides and Denktash last met in Switzerland in August last
year for U.N.-sponsored negotiations that failed to narrow their
differences. Denktash has since said that he had no wish to resume
talks unless the Greek Cypriots, whose government is the only
internationally recognized administration on the island, withdraws
its bid to join the European Union. He has also demanded the
recognition of the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus.
	   Clerides, whose government began membership talks with the EU in
March, has rejected both conditions.
	   The start of the talks coincided with an announcement by a Greek
Cypriot general that Greek air, ground and naval forces would take
part in war games scheduled to begin in Cyprus next week.
	   Speaking at a news conference, Brigadier-General Panayiotis
Tatsiopoulos said that in the drills, Greek warplanes might use a
controversial new air base near the western town of Paphos.
	   Greek-Turkish tension rose considerably in March when Greek jets
landed at the Paphos base less than a month after its completion.
	   Turkey condemned the deployment as belligerent and sent
warplanes to the north of the island days later.
	   Although allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Greece and Turkey have a rivalry going back centuries and both are
committed to the defense of their fellow communities on Cyprus.

Report: US proposes to extend interim period of talks to 2001
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American compromise plan has been introduced
at the Mideast summit to extend the interim period of peace talks
between Israel and the Palestinians to January 1, 2001, Channel Two
reported Friday.
	   In exchange, the report said, Israel would agree in principal to
accept a future Palestinian state. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has said he would declare statehood unilaterally in May 1999, when
the interim period of talks are due to end.
	   At the summit at a secluded resort on Maryland's eastern shore,
the Americans are prodding Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu toward agreeing on a long-delayed Israeli pullback from
part of the West Bank, part of a series of interim agreements
signed by the two sides starting in 1993. Negotiations have been
stalemated for a year and a half.

Iraqi-appointed leader of Kuwait is said to have defected
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Kuwaiti officer who was appointed prime
minister after Iraq's invasion in 1990 has defected to a European
country, an Iraqi dissident group said Friday.
	   Col. Alaa Hussein Ali has arrived in a European country after
being granted refugee status by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Turkey, said an official of the London-based Iraqi
National Congress.
	   The official refused to reveal the country in a telephone
interview from his office in London.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. A UNHCR
spokesman in Ankara said the agency's confidentiality rule barred
him from discussing individual cases.
	   Alaa was an obscure lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army when Iraqi
forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 1990. He was summoned to Baghdad,
promoted to colonel, and named as prime minister of a 9-member
``Provisional Kuwait Free Government.''
	   Alaa had studied management at Baghdad university and was a
member of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, the dissident group's radio,
Iraqi Broadcasting Corp., said in a statement received in Cairo.
	   One week after the invasion, Alaa was seen on Iraqi television
asking President Saddam Hussein to unite Kuwait with its big
neighbor. Hours later Baghdad announced that Iraq had annexed
Kuwait and Alaa disappeared from public view.
	   The radio called Alaa ``the Quisling head of Saddam's puppet
government'' after the Norwegian officer who supported the German
invasion of Norway in 1940 and was appointed ruler.
	   The radio said Alaa left Iraq via Jordan and arrived in Turkey
on Aug. 13, accompanied by his wife and four children.
	   Alaa had been trying to defect since 1994, but was refused
permission to leave Iraq, the Iraqi National Congress official
said.
	   ``Lately he told them (Iraqi authorities) that he wanted to
visit his parents in Amman (Jordan) because they were sick,'' said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Alaa was then granted permission and entered Jordan on an Iraqi
passport, the official said.
	   The UNHCR arranged his resettlement in a European country, the
official added.
	   Alaa has nine sisters and brothers living in Kuwait, the radio
said.

Police arrest suspects in ritual killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula have
arrested several people suspected of being involved in ritual
killings, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Friday.
	   Investigators believe they are members of a satanic cult,
ITAR-Tass said, quoting the Crimean prosecutor's office.
	   It said the suspects were originally arrested in connection with
an assault on a watchman at a theater in the Crimean capital,
Simferopol. A search of one of the suspect's apartments turned up a
human skull coated with varnish.
	   The 19-year-old suspect confessed the skull belonged to one of
the cult's victims, ITAR-Tass said. It said he gave details of a
similar ritual killing in the summer in which the cult members
strangled a 14-year-old girl and cut off her head and boiled it.

African cruelty charges &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRITS, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Friday postponed a release
order for 30 young elephants from a wildlife export farm, where
animal welfare officials say they are being badly treated.
	   Judge Herman Glas set Tuesday for an on-site inspection that
will include two elephant experts from Kenya _ Daphne Sheldrick and
Joyce Poole _ to examine the elephants and their enclosure.
	   The owner of the animals, African Game Services, told the court
on Friday that the elephants would die if they were moved,
according to Rick Allan of the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.
	   ``That's why we're (bringing) our own experts, to get here and
make a decision,'' said Allan. ``The elephants have been
traumatized.''
	   Earlier this week, Glas ruled in favor of Allan, who said the
elephants' feet were tethered and chained when he inspected the
farm in August.
	   Since their capture along the Limpopo River in neighboring
Botswana in August, the 5- to 10-year-old elephants were being
tamed so they could be sold to zoos and safari parks.
	   International wildlife organizations have been lobbying for
their release.

Settlers block road after incident with Palestinian police

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Angry Jewish settlers blocked the
West Bank's north-south highway Friday and others burned tires
after complaining that Palestinian police had detained, beaten and
fired on two of their security officers.
	   Palestinian security officials confirmed the two settler guards
were briefly held, but denied they were roughed up.
	   In Friday's protest, about 100 settlers, including children,
laid an electricity pole across the highway to block traffic.
Settlers sat on the pole and on boulders on the side of the road,
reading from the Torah. Israeli troops directed motorists to an
alternate route to avoid a traffic jam.
	   After about an hour, the protesters dispersed.
	   Later Friday some 50 settlers staged a protest on the road
outside of the West Bank settlement of Ofra near Ramallah, burning
tires and briefly blocking traffic, police spokesman Ofer Sivan
said.
	   The confrontation began Thursday evening when the security chief
for nearby Jewish settlements and his deputy were patrolling the
West Bank's north-south highway after repeated incidents of
rock-throwing by Palestinians, according to a settler statement.
	   The security officers' car was hit by rocks from a Palestinian
car, the statement said. The two Israelis chased the car into the
Palestinian-run town of Ramallah, where, they said, the attackers
escaped into the residence of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.
	   The settlers said Abbas' guards stopped the Israeli car, pulled
out the two security guards, confiscated their weapons and
equipment, beat them and fired on them. Later they were taken to
the joint Israeli-Palestinian regional office and released.
	   The Palestinian security officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Israeli vehicle was stopped near Abbas' house
because it appeared suspicious. The officer said the joint command
was called, and its officers escorted the Israelis out.
	   In the West Bank's Gush Etzion settlement bloc south of
Jerusalem, shots were fired from a Palestinian village at a guard
post near an Israeli settlement on Thursday night, Israel radio
reported. No one was injured.
	   Settler leaders are in Washington to accompany the summit
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They briefed one of Netanyahu's
aides about the incident, and advised against handing more
territory over to Arafat under the circumstances.
	   Late Thursday night, Netanyahu aides at the summit telephoned
high ranking army officers in the West Bank and told them that
action should be taken against the Palestinian policemen involved
in the incident and that the security guards' equipment should be
returned to them, Army Radio reported.
	   About 160,000 settlers live in the West Bank, among more than
1.5 million Palestinians. The settlers charge that any agreement to
transfer territory to the Palestinians would endanger their
security. Palestinians charge that armed settlers harass and
threaten them.

Japan's Foreign Minister to work on World War II peace treaty with

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to UPDATE with Komura's arrival. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura will
spend the weekend working toward a World War II peace treaty with
Russia, which the two countries have never signed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has promised that a treaty will be
signed by 2000, although it hinges on solving a dispute over the
Kuril Islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war off
Russia's Pacific coast.
	   There have been no signs of progress on resolving the
disagreement, despite an overall improvement in relations.
	   In an interview published Friday, Komura said Russian-Japanese
relations have made progress because of summits between Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin and Japan's former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
	   ``In Russian-Japanese relations ... there has been a continuous
dialogue on a high level,'' Komura told the daily Nezavisimaya
Gazeta.
	   Komura, who arrived in Moscow on Friday night, is expected to
meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and other top officials, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The visit comes one day after Russia's parliament voted to
reinstate a holiday marking the defeat of Japan in World War II.
The holiday had been dropped after the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, agreed
to reestablish the Day of Victory Over Militarist Japan, which
marks the Soviet Union's defeat of Japan on Sept. 3, 1945, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The measure, which has already been approved by the lower house,
requires President Boris Yeltsin's signature to become law.
	   A liberal Russian lawmaker, meanwhile, said Thursday it would be
``impossible'' to pass an agreement on the Kurils through the
current parliament.
	   ``Therefore this subject should not be brought into Russia's
internal political debate before the next parliamentary election,''
said Vladimir Averchev, a member of the Yabloko party and the State
Duma's international affairs committee, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.

 &UR; Solution near for South America's war-threatening border dispute &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with President Frei predicting solution, RECASTS
throughout to add background &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Three Latin American presidents and a
special envoy from the United States will start hammering out a
peace agreement this weekend to try to end the region's last
remaining war-threatening border dispute.
	   ``A definite solution is now very near,'' Chilean President
Eduardo Frei said at a press briefing here Friday. His country is
one of four guarantor nations to a 1942 treaty that ended a war
between Peru and Ecuador, but failed to satisfy a dispute over a
short section of their jungle border.
	   Presidents of three of the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile and
Argentina _ expected in Oporto for Sunday's Ibero-American Summit _
agreed to meet Saturday, Frei said. They are expected to be joined
by special U.S. envoy Luigi Einaudi.
	   An Argentine diplomat involved in the process predicted success
within days.
	   The 57-year-old dispute has erupted in war between Ecuador and
Peru three times, most recently in 1995. Tensions flared again in
August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of entering its
territory.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
area.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador
met with President Clinton in Washington earlier this month and got
his promise to help find a solution to the dispute. They told him
they had made substantial progress toward completing a peace
agreement, but remained at odds over delineating the actual border
area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   Hopes for a quick solution came Friday when legislators in Peru
and Ecuador approved proposals from their respective presidents to
accept any peace plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   The legislation meant that the four countries can impose a final
solution on the two Andean nations.
	   ``I don't see how it could fail now,'' said Alfredo Chiaradia,
Argentine under secretary of Latin American Affairs, who is
directly involved in the negotiations.
	   ``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a
proposal that implies the signing of a peace accord,'' Chiaradia
said.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

Swiss struggle to cope with influx of Kosovo Albanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Already struggling with a massive influx of Kosovo
Albanians, Swiss authorities said Friday they expect the number of
asylum seekers to reach an all-time high this year.
	   Nearly 500 refugees had to fend for themselves overnight _ some
huddled under cardboard boxes for warmth _ as overflowing reception
centers closed their doors to new arrivals.
	   ``The situation is very serious and it may get worse,'' said
Vera Britsch, a spokeswoman for the Federal Office for Refugees.
	   Switzerland, home to a large population of ethnic Albanians, has
acted as a magnet to refugees fleeing the fighting in Serbia's
Kosovo province. But a new influx has overwhelmed local and
national authorities.
	   The government next week is to consider using soldiers to help
care for the Kosovo Albanians. And it plans to open army barracks
to house the overflow.
	   Ethnic Albanians accounted for a large chunk of the 26,000
requests for asylum _ 57 percent more than in 1997 _ in the first
nine months of the year. A big jump is expected for October as many
more are believed to be en route, either via Italy or from eastern
Europe through Germany.
	   Jean-Daniel Gerber, director of the refugee office, said he
expected the number of asylum seekers to top the record of 42,000,
set in 1991, by the end of the year. Tough asylum laws cut numbers
after that.
	   Swiss officials complain that their tiny country, with a
population of 7 million, is now shouldering too much of the refugee
problem and that neighboring France, Italy and Austria should be
doing more.
	   ``We have the impression that they are concentrating on
Switzerland,'' said Britsch. ``There's no burden sharing.''
	   Germany has also seen a big increase in the number of ethnic
Albanians applying to stay.
	   Kosovo refugees pose more headaches than Bosnians who fled their
earlier civil war. And whilst there was widespread public sympathy
for Bosnians, Kosovo Albanians have a bad reputation for drug
dealing and crime.
	   Swiss refugee director Gerber faced a hostile reception from
worried residents Thursday evening in the small northern village of
Bronschhofen, where an empty army barracks is to be used for the
refugees.
	   A small device exploded at the barracks earlier this week.
	   The refugee center at nearby Kreuzlingen, on the German border,
is so crowded that people are reportedly sleeping in the kitchen
and in corridors.
	   In Basel, on the border with Germany and France, about 170
ethnic Albanians were turned away from an accommodation center
Thursday night as there was no room for them.
	   In Geneva, on the French border, 300 people had to fend for
themselves, said Britsch. Most managed to stay with friends,
although some spent the night in the open, she said.
	   ``Disgraceful,'' lamented the mass selling daily Blick above a
front-page photo of haggard refugees thronged around a wire gate.
	   ``Switzerland can't even offer a bed for refugees. It turns
people back away and sends them back into the dark night.''

Sampras, as expected, moves into semifinals at ease
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rusedski ousting second-seed Rafter, quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seed Pete Sampras took a mere 57
minutes to overpower unseeded Tim Henman 6-0, 6-3 Friday and
advance at ease into the semifinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy
ATP tennis tournament.
	   The American, who attends the Vienna competition for the first
time, was the clear favorite to win the title.
	   ``You never know how you're gonna play,'' Sampras said after his
win, but ``my game just clicked today. I couldn't have played any
better.''
	   Sampras lauded Henman despite his clear defeat. ``Tim represents
the next generation of players,'' he said. ``He will be a
consistent top player as long as he wants to.''
	   Henman joked afterward saying, ``I played great _ the first
point.''
	   ``But I cannot complain really, because you are going to have a
bad match from time to time. I've had like 21 or 22 good matches in
a row.''
	   Sampras, an eleven-time Grand Slam winner, even compared his
performance with that in Hanover last year when he became ATP World
Champion. But he added, ``Tomorrow things may look quite
different'' when he meets fellow-American Todd Martin, who ousted
Cedric Pioline 6-4, 6-3 in another quarterfinal clash.
	   Later, hopes for a final pitting Sampras against second-seed
Patrick Rafter of Australia vanished when Britain's Greg Rusedski
downed Rafter in 76 minutes 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).
	   In semifinal play Saturday, Rusedski faces 24-year-old Slovak
Karol Kucera, who eliminated unseeded Jonas Bjoerkman of Sweden
6-3, 6-2.
	   Rusedski, who on Thursday subdued local darling Thomas Muster in
two straight sets, took revenge for the defeat he suffered at the
hands of Rafter in the U.S. Open final in 1997.
	   In head-to-head count, Rusedski still trails Rafter 2-5. It was
his second victory over a top-ten player after his first-round win
against Yevgeni Kafelnikov of Russia.
	   ``That's a great victory for me. To beat Patrick here was
definitely a step forward,'' comented a visibly elated Rusedski.
	   By his victory over Bjoerkman, Kucera made a major stride toward
first-time qualification for the ATP World Championship in Hanover.
Early this week, in an intermediate ranking, Kucera was in eighth
spot.
	   Kucera has steadily risen in ATP rankings since former top
player Miloslav Mecir took care of the young Slovak hopeful. ``I
like to work with him, he was always one of my idols, like (Ivan)
Lendl or (Stefan) Edberg.''

Mexico prosecutors ask maximum penalty for ex-president's brother
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GLORIA PEREZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) _ Prosecutors turned over more than 1,200
pages of summation to a judge Friday, asking him to convict the
brother of a former president of killing a political rival.
	   The report asked the judge to sentence Raul Salinas de Gortari
to the maximum allowed under Mexican law, 50 years in prison, an
official at the federal attorney general's office said on condition
of anonymity.
	   Salinas is charged with masterminding the assassination of
ruling party Secretary-General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu in 1994,
when Salinas' brother Carlos was president. The trial has lasted
for 2 1/2 years, and testimony concluded in late August.
	   Prosecution representative Miguel Angel Sanchez made no comment
as he turned over three volumes of the prosecution's summation to
the court in Toluca, 35 miles (55 kms) west of Mexico City.
	   The three volumes contain more than 1,200 pages of conclusions
and recommendations.
	   Mexico City newspapers reported that prosecutors in the
summation claimed that Raul Salinas' motives included the divorce
of Ruiz Massieu and the Salinas' sister, Adriana, as well as power
struggles over the food distribution agency that Raul Salinas
headed.
	   The defense now must present its own summation, and the judge
will issue his ruling.
	   Salinas was arrested in 1995, four months after his brother left
office. He has been held since at the maximum-security Almoloya de
Juarez prison 35 miles west of Mexico City, and has maintained his
innocence.
	   Raul Salinas also is on trial for illicit enrichment in another
court, and prosecutors are considering charging him with money
laundering and drug smuggling as well.
	   And Swiss authorities are investigating him for depositing
millions of dollars under false names while his younger brother was
president. Swiss court documents cite U.S. officials alleging the
accounts contain dlrs 132 million in drug-trafficking bribes.
Salinas says the money was legitimate.
	   Carlos Salinas, who served as president from 1988 to 1994, has
been living in Ireland and does not face any charges.

Man killed in car bombing in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ A motorist was killed Friday when a bomb
exploded in his car in southern Lebanon, security officials said.
	   Ali Alawiyeh, 52, was killed instantly when the bomb, weighing
about three kilograms, exploded at 8 p.m. (17:00 GMT) as he was
driving through the village of Qulalieh, 18 kilometers (11 miles)
south of the port of Tyre, the officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   It was not known whether the bomb was intended to kill Alawiyeh
or whether he was on a mission to kill somebody else.
	   Villagers said Alawiyeh, a scrap-metal dealer in Qulalieh, did
not belong to any militia or political party.
	   Car bombings are rare in south Lebanon, unlike roadside bombs,
which the Hezbollah guerrillas have often detonated under vehicles
of the Israeli army and their allied Lebanese militia in the
Israeli-occupied zone.
	   However, earlier this year a car bomb killed a senior official
of the Syrian-backed Amal guerrilla group which, like Hezbollah,
fights to oust Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. Amal blamed
Israel for the attack.

NGO report: United States and Mexico failing in drug war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Mexico and the United States are failing to
adequately combat drug trafficking over their borders because their
priorities are wrong, according to a report by the non-governmental
organization Geopolitical Drugs Watch.
	   The Paris-based group's annual report, published Thursday, said
both countries laid more emphasis on ``subversive groups'' in
Mexico, and cross-border economic ties than on the drug war,
allowing drug barons to flourish.
	   ``Despite the often spectacular seizures and arrests, the
bilateral structures to fight drugs put into effect by the U.S. and
Mexican governments ... have been incapable of reducing the
intensity of drug trafficking,'' the 200-page report said.
	   It added that, on a wider scale, the worldwide fight against
drugs is doomed if governments continue to believe the key is
increasing the number of police and troops fighting the barons, a
policy the report described as ``repressive, and therefore
reactive.''
	   The report claimed drug trafficking-related interests had gained
``considerable clout in Mexico's politics and economy since the
start of the 1980s.''
	   It said Mexican drug barons laundered money in the country's
tourist resorts, and that tourists contributed to their wealth and
legitimacy.
	   ``The millions of Americans that each year take vacations in
Mexico's tourist paradise spots unwittingly contribute to the
profits of the drug barons who have spent billions of dollars there
over the last 15 years,'' the report said.
	   The report implicated Carlos Hank Gonzalez, one of the most
powerful members of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, saying his ``shady businesses'' enjoyed widespread
protection.
	   Hank Gonzalez ``is untouchable and will probably remain so, in
the United States and Mexico,'' the report said, adding that he was
suspected of money laundering and drug trafficking.
	   Hank Gonzalez has served in many of Mexico's highest political
posts. Though he currently holds no political office, he is
considered a behind-the-scenes force in his party.
	   The Geopolitical Drugs Watch is a private French organization
whose sole income comes from research projects.

killing 8 antelopes &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Haunted by eight dead antelopes he is
accused of hunting and killing, one of India's most loved movie
stars suffered more embarrassment Friday with the discovery of
three rare antelopes and a peacock caged in his father's farmhouse.
	   Salman Khan, heartthrob of millions, was set for a tortuous
trial as a court rejected his plea for bail in the western desert
district of Jodhpur, where he being tried with two leading actors
and three popular actresses for allegedly killing eight antelopes
in two separate safaris _ between Sept. 26-28 and on Oct. 10. Some
of the antelopes were cooked and eaten.
	   The court found that Khan had pulled the trigger on both
occasions.
	   Hundreds of miles away near Bombay, investigators gave a
sensational twist to the case when they raided the sprawling
farmhouse of his father, script writer Salim Khan, and rescued a
black buck, two chinkara deer and a peacock kept in an iron cage.
	   One of the black bucks rescued in Bombay died while being
transported back to a wildlife park, Friday's Mid-Day newspaper
said.
	   India's tough wildlife laws consider the forcible trapping of
endangered animals as cruel as killing them. The charge of poaching
endangered wild animals carries up to seven years in prison.
	   ``We have evidence enough for these actors' conviction,'' the
state's top wildlife official Alka Kala said in a telephone
interview from Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan state where Jodhpur is
located.
	   Salman Khan has been the heartthrob of many Indian women for
almost a decade. He is seen as a Sylvester Stallone-type macho
romantic who fights for love in gutwrenching action sequences.
	   Another popular actor, Saif Ali Khan, and actresses Sonali
Bendre, Tabu and Neelam have been granted bail in the killing case.
Tabu and Neelam use only their first names.
	   Forest officials have also accused actor Satish Shah, famous for
his comic roles of colluding with Salman Khan.
	   Members of the local Bishnoi tribe, who worship the endangered
black bucks and chinkaras, alerted forest officials to the Oct. 10
killings in Jodhpur.
	   The Bishnois said they heard gunshots and rushed to the site,
where they found the actors with the dead animals. The movie stars
quickly drove away with one black buck, tribe members said. Tribe
members buried the other two animals.
	   Salman Khan faced nearly a thousand angry protesters of the
Bishnoi community when he entered the courthouse on Thursday, and
several furious men said he would not have escaped unhurt from the
preserve if he had been caught after the late night hunt.
	   ``If we had laid our hands on Salman Khan that night, we
wouldn't have left him well enough to work in films any more,'' one
of them, Mohan Ram Bishnoi, was quoted as saying by The Pioneer
newspaper.
	   More than 100 people _ including the person who drove off with a
bleeding black buck and the chef who cooked it to the actors'
specifications _ gave evidence against the film stars, officials
said.
	   The hunt apparently took place during a break from filming.

Iranian hardliners vow to kill Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KAVEH GOLESTAN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ More than 1,000 Iranians staged a noisy
demonstration Friday against British author Salman Rushdie, vowing
to kill him and the publishers of his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   The protesters cheered as the organizers unveiled a three-story
portrait of an alleged would-be assassin of Rushdie that was
painted on an apartment building in a northern suburb of Tehran.
	   The crowd carried banners reading ``There is no turning-back
from Imam Khomeini's fatwa'' in clear opposition to the
government's decision last month to distance itself from the death
sentence imposed on Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   The ayatollah, the leader of the Islamic Revolution of 1979,
condemned the Booker Prize-winning author to death on the grounds
that his book blasphemed Islam.
	   The Iranian government said last month that it did not support
the bounty offered for the death of Rushdie and, after a meeting
between their foreign ministers on Sept. 24, Britain and Iran
decided to upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level.
	   The move has been fiercely attacked by hard-liners in Iran who
oppose the policies of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami. A
semi-government organization raised the bounty to more than dlrs
2.8 million and Friday's demonstration was the second this week by
supporters of the fatwa.
	   ``Our government must know that if they don't want to
participate in carrying out the orders of Imam Khomeini, that's
fine. But if they want to interfere with his edict, then we are
facing serious problems,'' the protest leader, Allah Karam, told
the crowd through loudspeakers.
	   Demonstrators shouted ``Rushdie must die.''
	   A man in a wheel-chair took the podium to deliver a message in
English to Rushdie: ``Listen to me. Remember my face. I'm your
killer. I want to have a dialogue with you - with a machine gun. We
will kill you.''
	   The organizers introduced another man, his face covered by a
black and white checkered scarf that revealed only his eyes, as the
person who would try to carry out the death sentence.
	   The 25 by 10 meter (82 by 33 feet) mural showed Ayatollah
Khomeini and Mustapha Mazeh, who died in 1989 in a London hotel
while working on a homemade bomb.
	   British police, who guard Rushdie closely, have dismissed
reports that Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, planned to
kill Rushdie, but in Iran he is believed to have targeted the
author.
	   The demonstrators also vowed to kill the staff of
Viking-Penguin, which originally published ``The Satanic Verses.''
The company has had its premises bombed in several countries.
	   Most of the demonstrators had earlier Friday taken part in the
funeral procession for three Iranian diplomats slain in
Afghanistan.
	   More than 10,000 people atttended the funeral of the diplomats
who were slain by Taliban militiamen in the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August. Their bodies were returned on Oct. 11.
	   The bodies of the other five diplomats and a journalist killed
during the Aug. 8 attack on the Iranian consulate were buried in
Iran last month.
	   The Taliban's return of the bodies is seen as an attempt to
improve relations with Iran, which has massed more than 200,000
troops on its border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, which now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
do not have diplomatic relations with Iran and accuse the country
of supporting their opposition.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO on Friday extended the deadline
for Yugoslavia to come into compliance with terms of a peace deal
on Kosovo, giving President Slobodan Milosevic until Oct. 27 to
honor the agreement.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the force of about
400 warplanes ready for possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo
deal struck this week with Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that an unacceptable number of Serb troops
and police remained in the province.
	   The extension of Saturday's deadline was expected to be granted,
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Earlier Friday, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a second
pact in two days to make sure the Yugoslav president pulls his
forces out of the strife-torn province.
	   The accord allows 2,000 unarmed monitors for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo
and verify whether Milosevic keeps his word to end the crackdown.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
signing the agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanic.
	   Geremek said so far he had received promises from member
countries for about 800 volunteers, although he did not say how
long it would take to train, equip and station the monitors in
Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Kosovo shortly
under an agreement signed late Thursday by NATO's supreme allied
commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army Chief of
Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The U2 spy planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this
weekend. Jetfighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy
planes are threatened, NATO sources said in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity.
	   That will help NATO determine Milosevic's compliance even before
the monitors start their work on the ground.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule
in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000 refugees
to return to their homes.
	   Geremek said, 12th graf pvs

Uruguayan writer hopes Planeta prize will add weight to her image

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The winner of Spain's prestigious Planeta
literary prize, Uruguayan writer Carmen Posadas, said Friday she
believed herself to be ``the anti-cliche of a writer.''
	   Posadas, 44, told reporters she hoped that winning the 50
million peseta (dlrs 350,000) prize for her novel `Pequenas
Infamias' (Minor Disgraces) would draw public attention to her
work.
	   Posadas admitted that her sometimes frivolous image had damaged
her credibility as a writer, although it was ``very useful for
selling perfume or running a boutique,'' the national news agency
EFE quoted her as saying.
	   Born in Montevideo, Posadas gained notoriety in Spain through
her mocking of Madrid's jet set during the 1980s economic boom in
television programs and in her books. She is married to Mariano
Rubio _ former governor of Spain's central bank who fell from grace
in 1994 amid an insider dealing scandal.

Williams serves fastest ace, reaches semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, ADDS quotes, detail, background, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Venus Williams blasted her
way into the semifinals of the European Championships on Friday,
polishing off a straight-sets win over Mary Pierce with a world
record serve.
	   At match point, Williams hammered a 205 km/hour (127.4
miles/hour) serve past a stunned Pierce, to close out the one-sided
contest 6-4, 6-1.
	   In earlier quarterfinal play, new world No. 1 American Lindsay
Davenport lived up to her new status, annihilating sixth-seed
Amanda Coetzer for her place in the semifinals.
	   The 22-year-old defending champion breezed past the world No.13,
dispatching Coetzer 6-3, 6-1 in just 58 minutes for her seventh
straight victory over the South African.
	   But for a short while the world's top player was overshadowed by
the world's fastest server, with Williams turning some of the media
attention Davenport is so uncomfortable with onto herself.
	   ``That's something, that's crazy,'' said Williams, whose
previous record was a spectacular 201 km/hr (125 miles/hr) in
Wimbledon. ``I teed up for an ace that serve. I hit that ball
perfectly. It was great timing and technique.
	   `It'll be awhile before I can get it faster, maybe the
Australian Open.''
	   The 18-year-old American was hitting big off the start, serving
up three love games in the first set.
	   Pierce kept up with Williams until 4-4, when the American broke
her serve, then held to clinch the set.
	   From the start of the second, Pierce was completely overwhelmed
by an aggressive, powerful Williams, who jumped to a 3-0 lead.
	   While Pierce clung to her serve to go 3-1, the American won the
next three games, firing three consecutive aces, closing out the
match with the record-breaker.
	   The American served a total of 13 aces.
	   ``I don't feel I missed any chances,'' said Pierce, seeded
seventh. ``I maybe had a small chance in the first set but in the
second there was nothing I could do against her.
	   ``I didn't look at the display board after she served that last
ace. It didn't seem any faster than the others.''
	   In her semifinal Saturday, Williams will meet fourth-seed
Nathalie Tauziat of France.
	   Tauziat, the losing finalist last year, booked her place in the
round of four with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Austria's Barbara
Schett.
	   The other semifinal will see Davenport take on world No.15 Irina
Spirlea of Romania, who disposed of eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost
6-4, 6-0 the quarterfinals, and third-seed Conchita Martinez in the
second round.
	   Playing with the confidence of a world No.1, Davenport dominated
her match against the tiny South African, who was able to hold her
serve just once the entire match.
	   Davenport took the South African's first two serves to jump to a
3-0 lead, but lost concentration, permitting Coetzer to break back
twice and even the set.
	   But Davenport regrouped to win the next seven games to take the
set and a 4-1 lead in the second.
	   Coetzer broke to go 4-1, but the American immediately broke
back, winning the next two games to wrap up the match.
	   ``I lost my concentration and missed a few easy balls,'' said
Davenport, the U.S. Open champion. ``But once I won that next game
and went up another break that was the turning point.
	   ``I probably shouldn't have let it get to that point, but for
the rest I played pretty well.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Titanic'' star Kate Winslet plans to marry her
boyfriend, aspiring film director Jim Threapleton, next year, the
couple announced Friday.
	   ``When you know it's the right thing, you just know,'' Ms.
Winslet said, posing for photographers outside the couple's north
London home. ``We want to get married sometime next summer, but we
want to keep the details a secret.''
	   Ms. Winslet, 23, and Threapleton, 24, met last year on the set
of the upcoming British film ``Hideous Kinky,'' where he was
working as an assistant director.
	   ``When you know, you know _ that's what I have been told all my
life _ and now I know,'' Ms. Winslet said. ``I knew instantly. I
thought, `Yep, I'll have that.' ''

General Assembly votes to select three new judges for Hague
</HEADLINE>
tribunal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, LEADING to UPDATE with final judge selected. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly selected three judges
Friday to fill a new trial chamber of the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, whose caseload is expected to grow following the
atrocities committed during the Kosovo conflict.
	   David Anthony Hunt of Australia, Patrick Lipton Robinson of
Jamaica and Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco were chosen from nine
candidates after four rounds of secret balloting.
	   Bennouna beat out Peter H. Wilkitzki of Germany in the final
round.
	   The three will sit on the tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands,
which was created in 1993 to try to bring justice for those
responsible for atrocities during fighting in the former
Yugoslavia.
	   The chief prosecutor of the tribunal, Louise Arbour, earlier
this week reaffirmed the tribunal's authority to investigate crimes
committed during the Kosovo conflict.
	   On Thursday, Arbour sent a letter to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic informing him that she would be going to Kosovo to
investigate and would visit areas where alleged crimes were
committed.
	   Milosevic's forces have been trying to crush an independence
movement by the Serb province's ethnic Albanian majority. Tens of
thousands have been routed from their homes and hundreds have been
killed, including about two dozen slain in two reported massacres
last month.
	   Since its creation, the court has indicted 56 suspects and has
26 in custody. The vast majority of those still at large are ethnic
Serbs living in Bosnia.
	   The Security Council approved the creation of a new trial
chamber last May to help deal with an increased caseload that came
after NATO arrested several suspects and other accused turned
themselves in.
	   The tribunal's two most notorious suspects, however, former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief
Gen. Ratko Mladic, remain at large despite international warrants
for their arrests on genocide charges.
	   Just two people have been convicted.
	   The tribunal handed down a 20-year sentence to a Bosnian Serb
found guilty of killing and torturing Muslims. He has appealed the
conviction and the sentence. The tribunal also gave a five-year
sentence to a Bosnian Croat who pleaded guilty to taking part in a
Bosnian Serb army massacre of Muslims following the fall of
Srebrenica.
	   There are currently five trials rotating in and out of the
tribunal's three court rooms.
	   Terms for the three new judges expire Nov. 16, 2001.

Trial resumes of alleged assassin of Lebanese prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The trial of a former Christian warlord
accused of killing a Lebanese prime minister resumed Friday.
	   Samir Geagea, former leader of the outlawed Lebanese Forces
militia, has pleaded not guilty to killing Prime Minister Rashid
Karami whose helicopter exploded in flight in June 1987.
	   Geagea, 46, who is already serving three life sentences for the
murder of two rival Christian politicians and attempting to kill a
third, looked thin and feeble when he arrived under military guard
at the Palace of Justice in Beirut. He is known to have been sick
in prison with an undisclosed illness.
	   The Judicial Council, Lebanon's highest court, heard testimony
from three witnesses and then adjourned to Oct. 23. Friday's
hearing was the first since May.
	   Geagea is charged with 15 alleged accomplices, including Brig.
Gen. Khalil Matar, formerly of the Lebanese army. Eleven accused
are being tried in absentia. Matar and three defendants have
pleaded not guilty.
	   In Christian parts of Lebanon, there is sympathy on the streets
for Geagea because he is the only militia leader to be prosecuted
so far for events that took place during the civil war of 1975-90.
	   The Maronite Christian patriarch, Nasrallah Sfeir, has said it
is unfair for Geagea to be prosecuted while other former warlords
are free. Some ex-militia leaders have become Cabinet ministers and
members of parliament.

Sampras reaches semifinals, but Rafter loses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Top-seeded Pete Sampras took only 57
minutes to overpower unseeded Tim Henman 6-0, 6-3 Friday and
advance to the semifinals of the dlrs 800,000 CA Trophy tournament.
	   ``My game just clicked today,'' Sampras said. ``I couldn't have
played any better.''
	   Henman said jokingly, ``I played great _ the first point.''
	   ``But I cannot complain,'' he added, ``because you are going to
have a bad match from time to time. I've had 21 or 22 good matches
in a row.''
	   Sampras, winner of 11 Grand Slam tournaments, compared his
performance with that at Hanover, Germany, last year when he won
the ATP title.
	   In Saturday's semis, Sampras will face Todd Martin, who beat
Cedric Pioline 6-4, 6-3 Friday.
	   In another quarterfinal, second-seeded Patrick Rafter of
Australia, the two-time U.S. Open champion, was upset by Britain's
Greg Rusedski 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).
	   ``That's a great victory for me,'' Rusedski said. ``To beat
Patrick was a step forward.''
	   Rusedski's semifinal opponent will be Slovak Karol Kucera, a
6-3, 6-2 winner over unseeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden.

Wall Street extends Fed-induced rally

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with close of trading in New York, Europe, picks up
11th graf, In Tokyo ... &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks moved higher on Wall Street Friday, with
the Dow industrials adding another 117 points to Thursday's
330-point buying frenzy sparked by an unexpected interest rate cut
at the Federal Reserve.
	   Earlier, stocks rose sharply in Europe and Asia as investors
were heartened by the unexpected Fed move and resulting gains on
Wall Street. The key market indexes in Hong Kong and Singapore both
surged about 9 percent, while Tokyo shares rose 2.2 percent to end
a three-day slump.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117.40, or 1.41 percent,
to 8,416.76, bringing its two-day advance to 447.98 and giving the
blue chip index a 517.24-point gain for the week.
	   The index of 30 major U.S. companies soared 4.2 percent Thursday
to the highest level since before the late August selloff. Most of
the 330.58-point advance, the third biggest point-gain in history,
came in the final hour of trading after the Fed announced the
second cut in lending rates by the U.S. central bank in less than
three weeks.
	   Fed officials, worried that the spread of economic instability
overseas has led financial institutions to cut back on lending, cut
two key short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point
Thursday.
	   The cut in both the discount rate and the federal funds rate
followed a decision Sept. 29 to lower its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, by
one-quarter point. The discount rate is the interest on loans by
the Fed to banks.
	   Although world markets quickly joined the celebration on Wall
Street, analysts said the surge could be short-lived as concerns
remain about the overall health of the world economy.
	   ``There is some nervousness that the Fed only saw fit to cut
rates by a quarter point a few weeks ago that's tempering
enthusiasm ... There's a slight nervousness the world economy is
worse than it thought'' at that time, said Peter Caulkett of London
brokerage Teather and Greenwood.
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index of
leading stocks initially rose 2.6 percent, but trimmed its gains to
1.5 percent. Prices also rallied in Italy and Switzerland.
	   In Germany, the DAX index rose 2 percent in late trading.
	   In Tokyo, 11th graf

School textbooks at root of hatred among peoples, say delegates at
</HEADLINE>
Greek conference.

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Authors of textbooks for children living
in Balkan countries should infuse them with a message of love for
their neighbors that might help stop the hate in that troubled
region, academics said at a conference in Greece on Friday.
	   A group of textbook specialists meeting in this northern port
city appealed to Balkan governments for a educational agreement
that would try to teach love instead of hate, peace rather than
war.
	   They hope their conference, which ends Saturday, will lead to
the establishment of a Balkan agency to collect information on
textbooks and try to change their contents.
	   ``The aim of our research is to improve the presentation of the
international picture in history and geography textbooks,'' said
Falk Pingel, assistant director of Germany's Georg-Ekert Institute
for International Textbook Research.
	   For centuries, Balkan countries, nations and ethnic groups have
fought over issues such as language, land, religion. In the past
decade alone, emphasis on divisions between neighbors have helped
fuel conflict in Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and all the former
Yugoslavia.
	   Even stable countries such as Greece and Turkey are not exempt
from age-old distrust and hatred. Turkey has been fighting Kurdish
insurgents, while disputes with Greece nearly turned to war just
two years ago.
	   ``There is one basic implication. That fighting, defeating and
being victorious in a battle and a war is a very positive
attitude,'' Pingel said.
	   But Pingel said this message was wrong, saying that the aim must
be ``to show that wars must be presented in another way in
textbooks. That to fight and to be brave is no longer a positive
attitude.''
	   Pingel is one of more than a dozen researchers and textbook
experts from 15 countries attending a conference on the image of
neighbors in Balkan school textbooks.
	   A survey of textbooks from Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia
and Turkey presented at the conference found that 23 percent of all
references to neighboring countries were negative, 73 percent
neutral and only three percent positive.
	   In Greek textbooks, 56.6 percent of the references to Turkey
were negative, while in Turkish textbooks, 55.5 percent of the
citations about Greeks fell under the category of ``enemies.''
	   ``The current textbook situation is not very homogeneous in the
Balkans. There are great differentiations depending on the
political development of each country,'' said German textbook
specialist Wolfgang Hopken. ``In Serbia I have not seen any
improvement in textbooks.''

Britain provides Libya details of Lockerbie proposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain said Friday it has refused to
negotiate on Libyan demands that two suspects, if convicted in the
1988 Pan Am bombing, serve their prison terms in Libya or the
Netherlands.
	   A U.S.-British proposal to try the men under Scottish law in the
Netherlands calls for the accused to serve their sentences in
Britain if convicted.
	   ``We are not in discussion with the Libyans about this and we
are not negotiating on it,'' said Britain's U.N. ambassador, Jeremy
Greenstock.
	   But Greenstock also assured that the suspects' religious rights
would be respected and pledged that any witnesses brought to
testify for the trial would be immune from any charges related to
the bombing while they were in the Netherlands.
	   ``They have a guarantee of immunity in that sense,'' Greenstock
said.
	   He spoke to reporters after briefing the Security Council on
Britain's efforts to clarify certain legal and technical questions
that have been posed by Libya regarding the U.S.-British deal.
	   Greenstock said he had passed along to the U.N. chief a ``full
set of clarifications,'' earlier this week regarding various
aspects of the proposed trial and the procedures surrounding it.
	   Two Libyan intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, are accused of planting the suitcase bomb that
ripped apart the New York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988,
killing 270 people in the air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
	   For years, Britain and the United States demanded that the trial
take place in the United States or Britain. Libya refused to hand
the men over, fearing they would never get a fair trial in either
country.
	   The United States and Britain agreed in August to hold the trial
in the Netherlands, using Scottish judges and Scottish law, in an
attempt to achieve justice in the 10-year-old case.
	   The Security Council backed the proposal by agreeing to suspend
an international travel ban on Libya once the two suspects arrived
in the Netherlands for trial. While giving its qualified acceptance
of the proposal, Libya has sought several clarifications of it and
has demanded that the sentences be carried out in Dutch or Libyan
prisons.
	   A Libyan legal team was in New York recently to discuss details
of the proposal with the U.N. legal team.

1860 wins, but fails to top Bundesliga table
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ 1860 Munich picked up another victory Friday
against VfL Bochum, but missed a chance to top the Bundesliga for
the first time since claiming the title 32 years ago.
	   Led by veteran striker Bernhard Winkler's seventh goal, 1860
ground out a workman-like 2-1 triumph against a young Bochum team,
but failed to win by the four goals it needed to pass cross-town
rival Bayern Munich at the top.
	   Both idle Bayern Munich, with a match in hand, and 1860 have 19
points in the league's eighth round and are seven points clear of
the field.
	   Defending champion FC Kaiserslautern also couldn't win for the
seventh straight match, this time being held to a 1-1 home draw at
the Betzenberg by VfL Wolfsburg.
	   Wolfsburg, the only team without a win and in 17th place, had
suspended four players for the match, including U.S. national team
player Claudio Reyna.
	   Winkler struck in the fourth minute off a brilliant cross by
Miroslav Stevic in a match stopped for three minutes after a smoke
bomb was hurled from the stands, causing numerous players to rub
their eyes.
	   With players from Munich's 1996 championship team watching from
the stand, 1860 turned in one of its worst performances of a season
in which it has posted a 6-1-1 record.
	   1860 was rocked when Bochum evened just three minutes after
Winkler's goal, as Sebastian Schindzielorz pounced on an error from
libero Gerald Vanenburg.
	   Australia's Ned Zelic fed Bernd Hobsch for the game-winner in
the 21st minute, but 1860 displayed little offensive sparkle
afterwards.
	   ``If we had been more alive, we had to earn a few chances. The
possibilities were there,'' said angry 1860 coach Werner Lorant.
	   Kaiserslautern needed an equalizer by Marco Reich in the 73rd
minute, following Detler Dammeier's goal in the 50th, to hold onto
the draw.
	   Kaiserslautern's defense, depleted by injuries, was so unsteady
that playmaker Ciriacio Sforza had to drop back in the second half
and play libero to steady it.
	   ``We want to see you fight,'' chanted the Kaiserslautern fans
among the 40,000 in attendance at their team, which clearly has
lost confidence since last season's improbable title win.

Bordeaux and Marseille win; PSG held to draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two goals in as many minutes gave Bordeaux a
comfortable 2-0 victory over Nantes Friday night to maintain its
surprise lead at the top of the French league.
	   In other action, Marseille kept up the pressure on the leader,
winning 2-0 away at Strasbourg. Paris Saint-Germain failed to give
new coach Arthur Jorge a winning start, drawing 1-1 away against
Lyon.
	   At Bordeaux, 30,000 spectators saw their team chalk up its
seventh win in nine games, with first-half goals from a Johan
Micoud header in the 37th minute and a left-footed drive by Kaba
Diawara a minute later.
	   Bordeaux could even afford to take the field without striker
Sylvain Wiltord, the league's top scorer with seven goals, who was
surprisingly dropped before the match.
	   Bordeaux has a one-point lead over Marseille.
	   Marseille, yet to concede a goal away from home this season,
beat Strasbourg with both goals coming from Florian Maurice, the
first a header in the 42nd minute and the second nine minutes after
the re-start from a cross by Robert Pires.
	   The margin of victory could have been greater: goalkeeper
Alexander Vencel twice frustrated Italian striker Fabrizio
Ravanelli with fine saves from a free kick and a shot.
	   PSG, which has had a disastrous start to the season, earned a
point at Lyon, but should have taken all three after creating
several chances against a poor home defense despite playing the
whole of the second half with 10 men after the expulsion of Pierre
Ducrocq.
	   Italian Marco Simone put the Parisians ahead after 18 minutes
with a volley, but Christophe Cocard equalized after 48 minutes.
	   Despite attracting international stars like Nigeria's Jay-Jay
Okocha and Christian Woerns of Germany in pre-season, PSG has only
won three games out of nine, and has lost to newly-promoted minnows
Sochaux and Lorient.
	   It was also dumped out of the European Cup Winners' Cup by
Maccabi Haifa after two poor performances against the modest
Israeli outfit.
	   The string of bad results prompted the club to sack coach Alain
Giresse.

Arrests in rape, attack, on Swiss women in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ Police on Friday arrested two of
five men who allegedly gang-raped three Swiss women as they drove
out of a game park in South Africa.
	   The women said they were raped through the night on Wednesday
after being abducted on their way out of Umfolozi game park in
northern KwaZulu-Natal, police said.
	   The third women escaped harm by saying she was ill.
	   ``She told them she had some kind of sickness, and they let her
be,'' said Giancarlo Fenini, a spokesman for the Swiss consulate in
Johannesburg.
	   The three women _ two age 31, the other 37 _ arrived in South
Africa earlier this week for a holiday and to visit friends in
KwaZulu-Natal.
	   The attack would cause irreparable damage to South Africa's
budding tourism industry, said Peter Mokaba, Deputy Minister of
Tourism.
	   ``We deeply regret that this incident took place,'' he said.
	   Two foreign tourists _ a German in Durban, and an American in
Cape Town _ have been murdered this year.
	   The victims were on Thursday flown back to the crime scene in a
police helicopter, and were scheduled to fly back to Switzerland on
Sunday or Monday.
	   Fenini said earlier they would return on Friday, but all flights
were booked, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Many of the 45,000 Swiss citizens who visit South Africa every
year have reported being robbed here, Fenini said.
	   Police at first could not take statements from the victims until
a Swiss tourist guide could be found in Durban.
	   Police spokesman Charl Scheepers said the victims' car was found
badly burned about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the game park after
a search that involved road blocks, helicopters and dogs. Their
belongings were found intact, said police Capt. Zobaphi Ngubane.
	   The arrests were made in two separate towns about 60 kilometers
(36 miles) from the park and no further details were immediately
known about those detained.
	   ``The people that will be most affected economically from the
(attack) will be those living in the area, who sell arts and crafts
and fruit along the roadside,'' said Sakkie Hattingh, executive
director of KwaZulu-Natal's tourism promoters, Timeless Afrika.

Miss Croatia stripped of her title

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ One thing is certain: for the time being,
Lejla Sehovic is no longer Miss Croatia.
	   Whether it is because of voting irregularities _ as organizers
say _ or because of her Muslim heritage is the point no one can
agree on.
	   Contest organizers stripped Sehovic of her crown Friday, saying
an examination of ballots turned up inconsistencies.
	   Sehovic, a classic beauty with long dark hair and dark eyes,
counters that she won fairly, and alleges that she was ousted
because she is a Muslim.
	   ``In the future they should list the real criteria for the ...
(contest): nationality and religion,'' she told reporters after
appearing _ uninvited _ at a news conference held by contest
organizers.
	   The fracas surrounding the highly popular Miss Croatia pageant
raised sensitive religious and ethnic issues again in this
predominantly Roman Catholic country of 4.6 million that has
already been shaken by recent political scandals.
	   Croatia supported Bosnian Croats who fought Muslims for control
of the western part of Bosnia for one year. Although that war ended
in 1994, relations between the two nations have remained tense.
	   Nothing seemed wrong Sunday night, though, at the glamorous
pageant aired live on national television. When Sehovic was
proclaimed the winner, the audience applauded. Fireworks went off.
	   However newspapers reported that behind the scenes, some
organizers were panicking, worried that the public, and _more
importantly _ some nationalist government officials would be
troubled by having a Muslim win such a high-profile contest.
	   The mass circulation daily Vecernji List reported that
organizers tried to persuade one judge, former winner Anica
Martinovic, to stop lobbying for Sehovic, ``fearing that the public
would be disturbed if a Muslim is elected.''
	   Chief organizer Milan Seckovic denied any political motive,
accusing three former pageant winners of giving all their points to
Sehovic and none to Ivana Petkovic, who finished second. He also
said one judge gave Sehovic no points on the first round, then gave
her the maximum for the final tallly.
	   But Sehovic served notice that she wouldn't surrender her title,
which comes with an undisclosed amount of money, a Fiat Brava and a
diamond ring. She appealed to Petkovic not to accept the Miss
Croatia title. She said she would seek protection from president
Franjo Tudjman, parliament and non-governmental human rights
organizations.
	   ``I am a Croatian citizen and I have every right to represent my
country,'' Sehovic said. ``The fact that I'm Muslim should not
matter _ this should be a beauty contest.''

Williams serves fastest ace, reaches semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS quotes, detail, background &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ American Venus Williams blasted her
way into the semifinals of the European Championships on Friday,
polishing off a straight-sets win over Mary Pierce with a world
record serve.
	   At match point, Williams hammered a 205 kmph (127.4 mph) serve
past a stunned Pierce, to close out the one-sided contest 6-4, 6-1.
	   In earlier quarterfinal play, new world No. 1 American Lindsay
Davenport lived up to her new status, annihilating sixth-seed
Amanda Coetzer for her place in the semifinals.
	   The 22-year-old defending champion breezed past the world No.
13, dispatching Coetzer 6-3, 6-1 in just 58 minutes for her seventh
straight victory over the South African.
	   But for a short while the world's top player was overshadowed by
the world's fastest server, with Williams turning some of the media
attention Davenport is so uncomfortable with onto herself.
	   ``That's something, that's crazy,'' said Williams, whose
previous record was a spectacular 201 kmph (125 mph) in Wimbledon.
``I teed up for an ace that serve. I hit that ball perfectly. It
was great timing and technique.
	   `It'll be awhile before I can get it faster, maybe the
Australian Open.''
	   The 18-year-old American was hitting big off the start, serving
up three love games in the first set.
	   Pierce kept up with Williams until 4-4, when the American broke
her serve, then held to clinch the set.
	   From the start of the second, Pierce was completely overwhelmed
by an aggressive, powerful Williams, who jumped to a 3-0 lead.
	   While Pierce clung to her serve to go 3-1, the American won the
next three games, firing three consecutive aces, closing out the
match with the record-breaker.
	   The American served a total of 13 aces.
	   ``I don't feel I missed any chances,'' said Pierce, seeded
seventh. ``I maybe had a small chance in the first set but in the
second there was nothing I could do against her.
	   ``I didn't look at the display board after she served that last
ace. It didn't seem any faster than the others.''
	   In her semifinal Saturday, Williams will meet fourth-seed
Nathalie Tauziat of France.
	   Tauziat, the losing finalist last year, booked her place in the
round of four with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Austria's Barbara
Schett.
	   The other semifinal will see Davenport take on world No.15 Irina
Spirlea of Romania, who disposed of eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost
6-4, 6-0 the quarterfinals, and third-seed Conchita Martinez in the
second round.
	   Playing with the confidence of a world No.1, Davenport dominated
her match against the tiny South African, who was able to hold her
serve just once the entire match.
	   Davenport took the South African's first two serves to jump to a
3-0 lead, but lost concentration, permitting Coetzer to break back
twice and even the set.
	   But Davenport regrouped to win the next seven games to take the
set and a 4-1 lead in the second.
	   Coetzer broke to go 4-1, but the American immediately broke
back, winning the next two games to wrap up the match.
	   ``I lost my concentration and missed a few easy balls,'' said
Davenport, the U.S. Open champion. ``But once I won that next game
and went up another break that was the turning point.
	   ``I probably shouldn't have let it get to that point, but for
the rest I played pretty well.''

Incoming German government agrees on foreign policy

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks over, no agreement on energy taxes &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
agreed on the foreign policy guidelines of a new center-left
coalition Friday, clearing a major hurdle in their negotiations.
	   The dominant Social Democrats stressed that the accord pledges
continuity in essential areas, such as firm German support for
NATO, European integration and partnership with the United States.
	   Both parties also agreed that foreign missions for German
soldiers should be covered by international law, a reference to a
United Nations mandate.
	   The accord signaled a coming of age for the Greens, a party with
pacifist leanings rooted in the 1980s European peace movement.
Radical demands in their election platform, such as a call for
eventually disbanding NATO, were thwarted by the Social Democrats.
	   Both sides said the talks had gone unexpectedly smoothly.
	   ``We knew from the start that we would not be able to cancel the
reigning logic in foreign policy,'' said Ludger Volmer, the leading
Greens left-winger.
	   Hours earlier, he abstained in a vote by the outgoing parliament
on sending German warplanes into any NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslavia if it fails to comply with this week's peace accord on
Kosovo. Most Greens and Social Democrats supported the measure,
which passed by a vote of 500-62.
	   With the coalition deal, Volmer said he expected that such
conflict would not resurface during the new government's four-year
term because both parties are calling for more emphasis on
preventive diplomacy.
	   A Greens demand for abolishing compulsory military service was
referred to a commission that will debate army reforms.
	   Both sides also said they would honor a commitment made by
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government backing the
Eurofighter military jet.
	   ``We'd like to get out of the Eurofighter, but we have to honor
the agreements,'' Volmer said.
	   Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy hope to break U.S. domination
in the fighter jet market by cooperating in building their own.
Their first firm order, 14 billion marks (dlrs 8.75 billion) for
148 planes came in September.
	   After the announcement, both parties went back into talks on
energy taxes that lasted into the night, without agreement.
Edelgard Bulmahn, a negotiator for the Social Democrats, said party
leaders would tackle the subject again Saturday.

Tuesday dubbed Sosa day in Dominican Republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ It's not quite a
national holiday, but it's close enough for Dominican baseball hero
Sammy Sosa's millions of fans here.
	   President Leonel Fernandez declared next Tuesday, when Sosa is
scheduled to return to his homeland, a ``Day of National
Celebration'' in honor of ``Slammin' Sammy's'' 66 home runs this
season.
	   The Chicago Cubs slugger, who has been raising hurricane relief
funds for the Dominican Republic, plans to visit his hometown of
San Pedro de Macoris, which was hard-hit by Hurricane Georges on
Sept. 22.
	   At least 283 Dominicans died and more than 100,000 were made
homeless by the hurricane.
	   Dominicans feverishly followed Sosa's home run battle with the
St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire, who ended up with 70. Thousands
of motorists have taped the numbers ``66'' to their car
windshields.
	   ``The Dominican people feel highly honored by the performance of
one of their most worthy sons, who has become a symbol of pride and
someone to emulate for all of the country's youth,'' read
Fernandez's declaration, issued Friday.

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams praises Nobel peace award

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on Friday
lauded the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to two of his
counterparts in the Northern Ireland peace process, praising the
honor as ``one for all of Ireland.''
	   Adams, head of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, said
he was not disappointed that the Norwegian Nobel Committee declined
to include him in the award as well for his part in trying to end
decades of sectarian violence in the British province.
	   Earlier Friday, John Hume, leader of the Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, and David Trimble, head of the
Protestant Ulster Unionist Party won the Nobel Peace Prize for
their part in trying to end the conflict.
	   ``Today, I am delighted that the Nobel prize has gone to
Ireland,'' the 50-year-old Adams said at a World Affairs Council
luncheon in downtown Philadelphia. ``I hope today's announcement
will act as a catalyst to the next part of the peace process.''
	   Dressed in a dark suit with a green ribbon symbolizing Sinn
Fein's demands for the early parole of IRA prisoners, Adams seemed
buoyed by the announcement throughout the hour-long appearance. As
he approached the podium, Adams cracked frequent smiles and
sprinkled a few jokes into his talk to the audience of 600.
	   ``There are two kinds of people here today _ the Irish, and
those who want to be Irish,'' he said.
	   He received a standing ovation, then signed autographs and posed
for pictures with groups of visiting high school students.
	   Many Nobel watchers thought Adams, too, deserved a stake in the
peace prize for spearheading the movement of Irish republicanism
from political isolation toward the international mainstream. A
former IRA commander and one-time prisoner, he became president of
the allied Sinn Fein party in 1983.
	   He helped broker the historic Good Friday peace agreement in
April, and is now on the verge of leading his party into a
cross-community government for Northern Ireland, a
Protestant-majority state the IRA and Sinn Fein once pledged to
destroy.
	   Among Adams' supporters is President Bill Clinton, who said
Adams deserved equal credit for his ``indispensable role'' in
brokering peace.
	   Adams deflected attention away from himself and onto America's
role in the process, and declined to speculate if the IRA's history
of violence played a part in his Nobel snubbing.
	   ``My message to the USA is this: we're going to get a democratic
settlement. Give the people of my country the chance that your
parents gave you,'' Adams said.
	   Adams acknowledges there is much more work to be done. Among the
roadblocks: Adams and Trimble have been unable to agree over
whether the IRA should surrender its arms.
	   ``We should put the last 30 years behind us, but we should never
forget it,'' Adams said. ``I am convinced we're going to see Irish
unity and independence. We deserve to have that.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly named three judges to
the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Friday to hear cases stemming from
the Bosnian war and prosecutions expected to arise from fighting in
Kosovo.
	   David Anthony Hunt of Australia, Patrick Lipton Robinson of
Jamaica and Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco were chosen from nine
candidates after four rounds of secret balloting.
	   Bennouna beat out Peter H. Wilkitzki of Germany in the final
round.
	   The three judges will sit on the tribunal at The Hague,
Netherlands. The United Nations set up the body in 1993 to punish
those responsible for war crimes committed during fighting in the
former Yugoslavia.

American baseball great hospitalized with pneumonia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background; NEW to some points &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ American baseball great Joe DiMaggio won't get to
throw out the ceremonial first pitch of the World Series on
Saturday night because he has pneumonia.
	   Instead, he plans to watch on television from his hospital room
while dining on pasta and hoagies.
	   DiMaggio, who will be 84 next month, was taken Monday to
Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, by his lawyer,
Morris Engelberg, a longtime friend.
	   ``He's had pneumonia three months. He walked around with it for
a couple of months. He couldn't knock it out,'' Engelberg said.
``He should be out this coming Monday.''
	   DiMaggio was the choice of New York Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner to throw out the ceremonial first pitch for Game 1 of
the Series. Now, Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa will do the
honors.
	   Hospital officials declined to comment on DiMaggio's condition.
Engelberg said the Hall of Fame center fielder prefers it that way.
	   ``He's a very private person,'' he said. DiMaggio's pneumonia is
nothing serious, Engelberg said.
	   ``He's fine,'' he said. ``He's had this once before seven or
eight years ago. He stayed in the hospital a week to knock it
out.''
	   Engelberg said that DiMaggio has a pacemaker to correct a heart
condition, and that he had fluid drained from his lungs this week.
Engelberg has been a regular visitor to his friend's hospital room.
	   DiMaggio, who played in 10 World Series during his 13 years with
the Yankees, was scheduled to fly to New York for this one. He
established himself as one of baseball's greatest players. He
played in 11 All-Star Games and was the American League's Most
Valuable Player three times.
	   His 56-game hitting streak in 1941 is still a record. He was
selected to the Hall of Fame in 1955, four years after he retired.

<TEXT>
	   ROCKVILLE, Maryland (AP) _ Mike Tyson's trial on criminal
assault charges stemming from a traffic accident now is scheduled
for Dec. 1.
	   It originally was set for Monday, the day he will find out if he
regains his boxing license.
	   Tyson's legal team had requested the postponement, announced
Friday, so the former heavyweight champion could appear before the
Nevada State Athletic Commission.
	   Tyson faces two misdemeanor assault charges after two men
contend he assaulted them following a traffic accident. The men say
Tyson kicked and punched them after a car driven by his wife,
Monica, was rear-ended. Tyson's lawyers have tried unsuccessfully
to settle.
	   Tyson's license was suspended after he bit Evander Holyfield's
ears and was disqualified in the third round of their title fight
June 28, 1997.

Convoy of Serbian military vehicles heads out of Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A convoy of 144 Serbian army
vehicles, including tanks and artillery trucks, appeared to be
heading out of embattled Kosovo province on Friday night.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the convoy on a
major road heading east toward the provincial border with Serbia.
Seventeen of the vehicles split from the main convoy and traveled
north through Pristina, the capital.
	   The convoy would be the first major withdrawal since President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke reached an
agreement Tuesday intended to prevent NATO forces from attacking
Serbian military targets in Kosovo.
	   Under the agreement, the Serbian army must reduce its forces in
Kosovo to levels from before the start of a crackdown on Kosovo
separatists in February.
	   Earlier Friday, NATO extended the deadline for compliance with
this week's agreement for 10 days, until Oct. 27.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A convoy of 144 Serbian army
vehicles, including tanks and artillery trucks, appeared to be
heading out of embattled Kosovo province on Friday night, only
hours after NATO extended a deadline for Yugoslavia to comply with
a peace deal.
	   The convoy would be the first major withdrawal since President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke reached an
agreement Tuesday intended to prevent NATO forces from attacking
Serbian military targets in Kosovo.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the convoy on a
major road heading east toward the provincial border with Serbia.
Seventeen of the vehicles split from the main convoy and traveled
north through Pristina, the capital.
	   Under the agreement, the Serbian army must reduce its forces in
Kosovo to levels from before the start of a crackdown on Kosovo
separatists in February.
	   Earlier Friday, NATO extended the deadline for compliance with
this week's agreement for 10 days, until Oct. 27.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the force of about
400 warplanes ready for possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo
deal struck this week with Serb authorities.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that an unacceptable number of Serb troops
and police remained in the province.
	   The extension of Saturday's deadline was expected to be granted,
giving both the Yugoslavs and the peace process more time in light
of this week's steps toward compliance.
	   Earlier Friday, Western and Yugoslav officials signed a second
pact in two days to make sure the Yugoslav president pulls his
forces out of the strife-torn province.
	   The accord allows 2,000 unarmed monitors for the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to roam Kosovo
and verify whether Milosevic keeps his word to end the crackdown.
	   ``This is only the first step'' toward peace in Kosovo, OSCE
chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister, said after
signing the agreement with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanic.
	   Geremek said so far he had received promises from member
countries for about 800 volunteers, although he did not say how
long it would take to train, equip and station the monitors in
Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Kosovo shortly
under an agreement signed late Thursday by NATO's supreme allied
commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army Chief of
Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The U2 spy planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this
weekend. Jetfighters could patrol the skies nearby in case the spy
planes are threatened, NATO sources said in Brussels, Belgium, on
condition of anonymity.
	   That will help NATO determine Milosevic's compliance even before
the monitors start their work on the ground.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule
in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000 refugees
to return to their homes.

Michelle Kwan stays in the present as she prepares for San Jose

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ Michelle Kwan and coach Frank
Carroll have always approached the Olympic silver medalist's
competition schedule with the same calculated precision as her
individual performances on the ice.
	   This season, they're taking it a bit easier, focusing on what
brought them this far in the first place: the skating. Kwan, a
recent high school graduate, has been working out in Lake
Arrowhead, Calif., perfecting her triple-triple.
	   ``This year we didn't really draw a target,'' she said.
	   But that doesn't mean Kwan is dropping out of sight. She's
skating this Saturday in the U.S. Pro Figure Skating Classic at the
San Jose Arena.
	   Because is it an open competition sanctioned by the
International Skating Union, skaters who are eligible for Olympic
and world competition can compete alongside professionals. Seven
International Skating Union judges will preside over the event.
	   Illia Kulik, the men's Olympic gold medal-winner this year in
Nagano, also joins the field which includes pro Rudy Galindo, who
won the national title in San Jose two years ago, and 1996 world
champion Todd Eldredge.
	   Kwan had planned to skate in just three events in her immediate
future: Saturday's event, the World Professional Championships and
Skate America.
	   But on Thursday, the ISU denied Kwan entry into Skate America in
Detroit Oct. 29-Nov. 1. Kwan did not originally apply for the
event, but then changed her mind. The ISU, which sanctions events
for Olympic-eligible skaters, said there wasn't room in the field.
	   ``It was kind of a last-minute thing and we didn't know if she
would be ready,'' Carroll said.
	   Kwan is caught between the push for a new series of open events
like the U.S. Pro Classic, and the traditional series for eligible
skaters _ including Skate America, one of six Grand Prix
competitions leading to the world championships.
	   The ISU has pressured the U.S. Figure Skating Association to
adhere to rules for participation in the Grand Prix series, which
don't allow Kwan to cross over to open competitions.
	   ``The USFSA is disappointed that the rules of the ISU have
operated to prevent the reigning world champion and one of the most
popular skaters in the world from competing in the USFSA's premiere
international event,'' USFSA president James Disbrow said on
Thursday.
	   The U.S. Pro Classic carries ISU approval, as does Kwan's other
planned event, the World Professional Championships.
	   Earlier this week, Kwan said she was unconcerned with all the
behind-the-scenes maneuvering. She was polishing a new short
program, with music from the opera ``Carmen,'' which she will debut
in San Jose.
	   ``I'm just working on my own business and focusing on that,''
she said.
	   Kwan, who took a rare vacation this year and returned to the ice
with renewed enthusiasm, said she has not yet decided whether
she'll skate in the nationals in February.
	   ``I hope I will go, it's such a great competition,'' she said.
``I have to feel good about myself and my skating to jump right
into nationals.''
	   But she is still shooting for the Winter Games in Salt Lake City
four years from now. Kwan, 18, won silver in the Nagano games
earlier this year, close behind gold medal-winner Tara Lipinski.
	   She had always visualized going to the Olympics for the first
time, but for Salt Lake City she's waiting to see how she
progresses. This time, she doesn't want to plan too far ahead.
	   ``I still love the sport,'' she said. ``I just hope to God I'll
be healthy and ready to go in 2002, physically and mentally.''

Barbados-Guyana Red Stripe semi-final stopped by rain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Heavy rain stopped play as Barbados set
a reduced target of 208 in 38 overs on 72 for three after 14.3
overs against Guyana in the first Red Stripe Bowl semi-final match
in Jamaica Friday.
	   A superb century innings from Shivnarine Chanderpaul spurred
Guyana to 237 runs for eight wickets earlier in the day.
	   The rain stopped play an hour into the Barbados innings at
Kaiser Sports Club. The innings had already been delayed an hour
because of early afternoon rain.
	   Guyana, the most consistent one-day team in regional cricket,
recovered from a disastrous start. After winning the toss and
electing to bat, they lost the first three wickets with only six
runs on the board. West Indies opener Clayton Lambert, Andrew
Gonzalves and Keith Semple were all back in the pavilion with only
six overs bowled.
	   The usually sedate Chanderpaul then dominated a third wicket
stand of 60 with Nicholas DeGroot before the latter was out for a
painstaking six in the 14th over.
	   Chanderpaul and his captain, Carl Hooper, took control with a
fourth wicket stand of 122. The left-handed Chanderpaul reached 50
off only 38 deliveries with two sixes and nine boundaries.
	   His innings slowed as he approached his first Red Stripe Bowl
century which came in the 37th over off 186 deliveries. Dropped in
the 40th over on 108, Chanderpaul was sixth out in the 45th over,
bowled by seam bowler Henderson Bryan for 109.
	   Hooper's innings of 78, a mixture of solid defense and
aggression, came off 124 deliveries and he struck seven boundaries
before he was fifth out.
	   Once Hooper and Chanderpaul were out within two overs of each
other, the Guyana innings went into decline with the last six
wickets realizing 59 runs.
	   Barbados lost in-form batsman and captain Philo Wallace without
scoring, bowled by fastbowler Reon King with the first ball of the
Bajans' innings.
	   A second wicket stand of 52 between Sherwin Campbell and Floyd
Reifer put Barbados back on track before Campbell was run out for
17 in the 11th over with the score on 52.
	   Nine runs later, Adrian Griffith was caught in the deep for
five, as Barbados struggled to 6-1 for three.
	   Floyd Reifer (32) and Roland Holder (6) are the not out batsmen.
	   Scores: Guyana 237-8 off 50 overs (Shivnarine Chanderpaul 112,
Carl Hooper 76; Hendy Bryan 3-56, Winston Reid 2-36, Pedro Collins
2-50). Barbados 72-3 after 14.3 overs.

Council, others, begins preliminary discussions on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
resolution &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Security Council members held preliminary
talks Friday on a resolution to endorse this week's Kosovo accord
and lend U.N. backing for organizations that will verify its
compliance, diplomats said.
	   The full text of the resolution hasn't been worked out. But
diplomatic sources said the council's intent was to ``enshrine the
commitment'' Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic made to the
international community after marathon talks with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke.
	   Specifically, council members were seeking to give the council's
blessing to a 2,000-member team that would roam Kosovo and verify
Milosevic is keeping his word, the sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Faced with threatened NATO attacks, Milosevic agreed Monday to
decrease his forces in Kosovo to levels from before the start of a
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in February and begin negotiations
toward self-rule in the southern Serbian province.
	   He pledged to let up to 300,000 refugees to return to their
homes and allow 2,000 unarmed monitors from the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe into Kosovo to
verify that the offensive has stopped.
	   A resolution would codify elements of the agreement into
international law.
	   Milosevic's forces began the offensive on ethnic Albanians in
February. Since then, hundreds have been killed and over 270,000
have fled their homes after Serb attacks.
	   The council demanded several of the elements in Holbrooke's
accord in a Sept. 23 resolution. NATO intensified its military
planning after the council stated Oct. 6 that the combatants hadn't
complied with the resolution.
	   Friday's consultations on a new resolution involved council
members as well as Germany and Italy, who have taken part in
regular discussions on Kosovo as members of the Contact Group of
states, the diplomats said.
	   Negotiations were expected to continue well into next week, they
said.
	   NATO on Friday extended the deadline for Yugoslavia to come into
compliance with terms of the deal until Oct. 27.

Steinbrenner, Giuliani score on ballot issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMUEL MAULL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In a big victory for New York Yankees owner
George Steinbrnner and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, voters will have no
say on the fate of a new Yankee Stadium.
	   A referendum on whether a dlrs 1 billion stadium should be built
on Manhattan's West Side was knocked off the ballot for next
month's election.
	   The ruling represents a setback for City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone, who is running for governor against Republican incumbent
George Pataki.
	   ``Either way, I think the issue is pretty clear,'' Vallone said.
``No matter what the court decides, I think it's highly unlikely a
stadium will be built outside the Bronx.''
	   The pro-ballot side promised to appeal immediately.
	   Steinbrenner, whose lease at Yankee Stadium expires in 2002,
wants a new home for his team. Giuliani, the city's self-described
No. 1 Yankees fan, proposed the new stadium at a site where
warehouses and rail yards now stand less than a mile south of Times
Square.
	   The push for a Manhattan stadium gained momentum in April after
a 500-pound (225-kilogram) steel joint fell at 75-year-old Yankee
Stadium, forcing it to close temporarily.
	   The appeals court ruled 5-0 the charter revision commission
appointed by Giuliani is legal. The vote reversed last Wednesday's
ruling by Bronx State Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon.
	   The appeals court also noted that whether there was a referendum
or not, the mayor could not ``unilaterally decree that public funds
should be spent on a new stadium.''
	   Giuliani called Friday's decision a ``victory for government
over politics.'' The mayor wanted to keep the referendum off the
ballot because it would almost certainly be defeated. Polls show
the public opposes a new stadium for the Yankees outside the Bronx.
	   Vallone intends to take the matter to the Court of Appeals. But
because the vote was unanimous, the City Council and Vallone must
ask permission to take the appeal further.
	   Late Friday, U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson signed an
order requiring the Board of Elections to print absentee ballots
with the Yankee Stadium issue on a separate page so the issue could
be included at the last minute if an appeals court reverses
Friday's ruling.
	   Lawyers for those wanting the Yankee Stadium issue on the ballot
say the mayor's commission is a sham, designed to keep the
referendum from voters.
	   But a city lawyer, Assistant Corporation Counsel Timothy
O'Shaughnessy, argued that as long as a charter commission is
appointed legally, and does its job legally, the mayor's motives
are immaterial.
	   ``We cannot take a public opinion poll and dress it up so that
it meets public referendum requirements, and put it on the
ballot,'' he said.

It's a Series of connections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hugs, handshakes and high-fives will be
plentiful during this year's World Series.
	   The New York Yankees and San Diego Padres are well connected,
like cross-country cousins. And despite playing only once _ in
their final spring training game this March _ and a 3,000-mile
(4,800-kilometer) gap between the cities, the teams were
intertwined by trades, non-trades and even a little turmoil long
before arriving at Yankee Stadium for Saturday's Game 1.
	   ``It's a fun time of year and it is kind of ironic that we are
playing against each other,'' San Diego's Jim Leyritz said.
	   The Series' many San Diego-New York combinations begin with the
pinstriped Padres. Leyritz, Brian Boehriner, Sterling Hitchcock and
Ruben Rivera played in New York. Even San Diego slugger Greg Vaughn
was with the Yankees _ for about 15 minutes.
	   On the Yankees' side, there's David Wells. The San Diego native
grew up rooting for the Padres and will now pitch against them in
the opener. Yankee utilityman Homer Bush was a San Diego farmhand
before being traded to New York and bench coach Don Zimmer managed
the Padres in the 1970s.
	   Then there's Hideki Irabu. He refused to play for the Padres
after they purchased his rights from Chiba Lotte of the Japanese
League, and only landed in the Bronx after San Diego and New York
worked out a deal following four months of heated negotiations in
1997.
	   Leyritz and Boehringer were on the Yankees' 1996 World Series
championship team and would like nothing better than to duplicate
that feat with San Diego. Leyritz will forever be remembered by
Yankees fans for his game-tying, three-run homer in Game 4 that
turned around the 1996 Series against Atlanta.
	   Leyritz played seven seasons for the Yankees and enjoyed every
minute of it. He enjoyed playing in the energized atmosphere, and
living in a city where you can get dinner at any hour.
	   ``To me, it's the warmest place I ever played,'' said Leyritz,
who rode the subway to the Padres workout. ``I really miss the
electricity here. You'd wake up in the morning and there's
electricity somewhere going on.''
	   Hitchcock, the MVP for San Diego in the National League
championship series after beating Atlanta twice, won 16 games from
1992-95 for the Yankees before being traded to Seattle in the deal
that made Jeff Nelson and Tino Martinez to the Yankees.
	   ``There was talk of trading me I don't know how many times,''
Hitchcock, San Diego's Game 3 starter, said.
	   ``It's been a very long time since I pitched here. It's much
different in some ways and in some ways kind of the same.''
	   And what kind of greeting does he expect?
	   ``Probably the typical New York reception,'' he said laughing.
``But I'm just looking forward to going out there. It's going to be
fun.''

Strawberry's big day: from hospital to home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DICK BRINSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The fans chanted ``Darryl ... Darryl'' as if he
were trotting out of the dugout to be introduced at the World
Series.
	   Instead, the New York Yankees outfielder was released Friday
from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, where two weeks ago he
underwent colon cancer surgery.
	   ``Wow! I never thought this day would come _ but it has,'' said
a thinner but relieved Strawberry, who will watch on television
Saturday night when his teammates open the Series at Yankee Stadium
against the San Diego Padres.
	   A few hundred chanting fans came to the hospital to wish the
36-year-old slugger well before he left for his home in suburban
New Jersey.
	   ``I want to say thank you to all the fans for all the support
they gave me, for all the cards, the letters and the flowers,'' he
said. ``I've had a very difficult time, but now that time is
over.''
	   Shortstop Derek Jeter couldn't agree more. He and his teammates
have worn Strawberry's No. 39 on their caps during the postseason.
	   ``It's about time,'' Jeter said before a workout at Yankee
Stadium. ``When we were there on the off-day, all he did was
complain to the nurses about how hungry he was.''
	   Strawberry, dressed in a gray hooded sweatshirt, was
considerably lighter than his 215-pound (97-km) playing weight.
	   ``As you can see, I've lost a lot of weight,'' he said. ``But
from my nurses to my doctors, they told me everything will come
back.''
	   He was visibly moved by the scene, but retained his composure
during an impromptu news conference, his wife, Charisse, at his
side.
	   The crowd, held back by barricades in the lobby, cheered several
times.
	   ``Go get 'em, Darryl,'' shouted a man in a Yankees hat.
	   ``We love you, Darryl,'' a woman said as he was wheeled to the
curb.
	   There, the 6-foot-6 (1.95-meter) player rose from his wheelchair
to greet medical personnel.
	   ``I'd like to thank everyone here at the hospital,'' Strawberry
had said moments earlier. ``It's sure amazing what I've been
through, and all the support I've gotten has really helped me.''
	   After hugging some nurses, Strawberry gingerly entered a car to
head home. He has no plans for a dramatic appearance at the
ballpark
	   ``I'm excited about my team being in the World Series,'' he
said.
	   If the Yankees get there again next year, perhaps he will, too.
Doctors says his chances for recovery are good, and Strawberry
could be in uniform by 1999.
	   Until the, he will undergo about six months of chemotherapy.
	   ``It's going to be a one-day-at-a-time process,'' he said. ``I'm
able to face it and deal with it.''
	   Strawberry was originally to be released last Sunday, but the
hospital said he was not yet able to eat normally and kept him a
few extra days.
	   ``The hospital has been wonderful,'' he said. ``The doctors and
the nurses, just getting me up to walk and all the things I had to
do to get to this point today.
	   ``I'm so pleased for my life that the cancer has been removed
from me. I'm truly looking forward to getting back to being
healthy.''
	   Former Yankee Jim Leyritz, now with the Padres and wearing a 39
_ Strawberry's uniform number _ on his cap, was happy to hear about
the release.
	   ``Some things are bigger than baseball,'' he said. ``I want him
to know I'm thinking about him. My prayers are with him.''

Stats don't lie: Big winners often fall short in World Series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Their season has been one big highlight reel,
from David Wells' perfect game to El Duque's debut to Derek Jeter's
clinching triple in the AL championship series.
	   And, oh, the numbers they've piled up: 24 series in a row
without losing any, 48 straight games of holding a lead, 114
victories in the regular season.
	   Yet here's one sobering stat for the New York Yankees and their
fans: Not since the 1989 Oakland A's has the top-winning team gone
on to win the World Series.
	   So it was no surprise that after taking the No. 4 subway from
Grand Central Terminal, Tony Gwynn arrived at Yankee Stadium for
the first time in his life Friday and pronounced his underdog San
Diego Padres ready to play.
	   ``It's our chance to put our city on the map,'' Gwynn said.
	   To do that and take their first title, the Padres will have to
topple baseball's most successful team. Coming off a season in
which they set an AL mark for victories, the Yankees will try to
win their record 24th crown.
	   ``I think there is always going to be a place in history for
us,'' said David Wells, who will pitch Game 1 Saturday night
against Kevin Brown.
	   The Padres hope to make their own October mark after surprising
both Houston and Atlanta in the NL playoffs.
	   ``We have been underdogs every time and we are still underdogs
in this series and we look forward to that,'' Padres postseason
hero Jim Leyritz said. ``We like the challenge.
	   ``I think there is pressure on both sides,'' he said. ``They
have had a great season so far. We have had a pretty good season, I
think.''
	   Leyritz, who helped the Yankees win the 1996 World Series and
will serve as the Padres' designated hitter at New York, is just
one of many players here with ties to both teams.
	   NLCS MVP Sterling Hitchcock and Brian Boehringer formerly
pitched for the Yankees. San Diego reserve Ruben Rivera also played
for them, and he's a cousin of New York closer Mariano Rivera.
	   Gwynn, on the other hand, had never been inside Yankee Stadium
until now. He arrived at the ballpark about two hours before
Friday's workout and toured Monument Park.
	   ``The first plaque you see is Babe Ruth,'' Gwynn said. ``It hits
you like a ton of baseballs. This is what it's all about.''
	   ``We're going to play on the same field where Babe Ruth hit 700
home runs, (Joe) DiMaggio had his streak, (Lou) Gehrig had has
games played streak, Don Larsen,'' he said. ``The list is
endless.''
	   Wells, a native San Diegan, pitched his perfect game at the park
in May. The ALCS MVP was 3-0 in the playoffs and is 7-1 lifetime in
the postseason.
	   Brown, too, has had his moments at Yankee Stadium. Overall, he's
12-3 with a 2.50 ERA against the Yankees, his top win total versus
an opponent.
	   ``It has been a while since I have faced most of these guys over
here,'' Brown said. ``So I don't know if there is any real
advantage one way or the other. Some of them have seen me in the
past. I am probably a little bit different than what they
remember.''
	   There was a bit of lineup news _ rookie Ricky Ledee will start
the opener in left field for the Yankees, ahead of Chad Curtis, Tim
Raines and Shane Spencer. All four started during the ALCS against
Cleveland, and manager Joe Torre picked Ledee because he bats
left-handed and does well in the field.
	   Torre also said Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez will pitch Game 2
on Sunday night, followed by David Cone and Andy Pettitte. Andy
Ashby will start Game 2 for the Padres, followed by Hitchcock.
Brown remains a possibility for Game 4.

Progress? NBA open to union proposal

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In one of the first signs of possible progress
in the National Basketball Association lockout, the owners agreed
Friday to accept the union's concept of a luxury tax on some
contracts to see if such a system will slow salary growth.
	   ``We are willing to try it the union's way, but they have to
agree that if it doesn't work, we then have to try it our way,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
	   The league asked for a two-year trial, with higher tax rates and
a lower threshold than the union had proposed. A hard salary cap
would kick in for the 2000-01 season if the percentage of league
revenue devoted to salaries failed to drop from 57 percent to 52
percent.
	   The union did not immediately respond.
	   According to the league's projections, the tax would have no
impact on 85 percent of the league's future contracts.
	   The league also included an exemption for any player who accepts
a so-called Larry Bird contract with a 5 percent raise. Such a rule
would allow the Chicago Bulls to re-sign Michael Jordan for about
dlrs 36 million next season without having to pay any tax.
	   Although the sides may have found a mechanism that will get them
to the middle ground on the main economic issue, a host of other
topics still have to be resolved before a collective bargaining
agreement could be put up for a ratification vote.
	   Granik said it will take about a week to settle the rest of the
issues after the sides agree to a new economic system.
	   The NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the season,
or a total of 99 games. More games will be lost if the sides can't
reach agreement soon.
	   There was no decision Friday from arbitrator John Feerick on the
issue of whether players with guaranteed contracts must be paid
during the lockout. Feerick's decision is due Sunday.
	   The league's proposal calls for a tax to be levied on any
contract signed under the Bird exception for more than dlrs 2.6
million, which was the average salary in the 1997-98 season.
	   The tax would be paid by owners, with the revenue redistributed
to low-revenue teams. In theory, it would deter teams from signing
overly lucrative contracts.
	   The tax rate would be 50 percent of the amount over dlrs 2.6
million for all contracts worth up to dlrs 10 million annually. For
contracts worth between dlrs 10 million and dlrs 15 million, the
tax would be 100 percent, between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20 million it
would be 150 percent, and for contracts worth more than dlrs 20
million the rate would be 200 percent, Granik said.
	   Under the union's tax proposal, which was presented to the
owners Tuesday, a 50 percent tax would be levied on any Bird
contract worth more than dlrs 18 million annually. (The Bird rule
allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain their own free
agents.)

Guyana advances after Red Stripe semi-final stopped by rain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Guyana advancing to finals; repeating to some
points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Guyana advanced to Monday's final of
the Red Stripe Bowl cricket competition Friday after its semi-final
match against Barbados at Jamaica's Kaiser Sports Club was
abandoned due to rain.
	   Barbados, which was chasing a reduced traget of 208 in 38 overs
after rain delayed the start of its innings by an hour, was 72 for
three off 14.3 overs when heavy rain swept across the ground.
	   Guyana had made 237 for eight off its allotted 50 overs earlier
in the day. The game was officially called off at 2036 GMT.
	   Under the rules conditions of the competition, Guyana will
advance to Monday's final because of its higher net run rate
throughout the zone competition.
	   Guyana, the most consistent one-day team in regional cricket,
recovered from a disastrous start to score a challenging 237 for
eight. After winning the toss and electing to bat, they lost the
first three wickets with only six runs on the board. West Indies
opener Clayton Lambert, Andrew Gonzalves and Keith Semple were all
back in the pavilion with only six overs bowled.
	   The usually sedate Chanderpaul then dominated a third wicket
stand of 60 with Nicholas DeGroot before the latter was out for a
painstaking six in the 14th over.
	   Chanderpaul and his captain, Carl Hooper, took control with a
fourth wicket stand of 122. The left-handed Chanderpaul reached 50
off only 38 deliveries with two sixes and nine boundaries.
	   His innings slowed as he approached his first Red Stripe Bowl
century which came in the 37th over off 186 deliveries. Dropped in
the 40th over on 108, Chanderpaul was sixth out in the 45th over,
bowled by seam bowler Henderson Bryan for 109.
	   Hooper's innings of 76, a mixture of solid defense and
aggression, came off 124 deliveries and he struck seven boundaries
before he was fifth out.
	   Once Hooper and Chanderpaul were out within two overs of each
other, the Guyana innings went into decline with the last six
wickets realizing 59 runs.
	   The Bajans got off to a bad start in their innings when captain
Philo Wallace was bowled first ball by fastbowler Reon King.
Wallace had amassed 225 runs in the tournament's preliminary round.
	   A second wicket stand of 52 between Sherwin Campbell and Floyd
Reifer put Barbados back on track before Campbell was run out for
17 in the 11th over with the score on 52.
	   Nine runs later, Adrian Griffith was caught in the deep for
five, as Barbados struggled to 6-1 for three.
	   Champions the Leeward Islands play Trinidad and Tobago in the
second semi-final Saturday at the same venue.

Women should have regular checks for breast cancer, ex-Beatle says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, whose
American-born wife Linda died of breast cancer in April aged 56,
says that women should get regular checks for the illness, even if
it means being ''fussy,'' tabloid newspapers reported Saturday.
	   ''The thing about breast cancer is the earlier you catch it the
better. Unfortunately, in Linda's case, we really got to it too
late. Although she had two and a half years of treatment, it turned
out that there was nothing much we could do about it,'' The Sun
quoted McCartney as saying.
	   ''So the trick for all women is to get checks, and to think
about things like mammograms, even though you think you may be
being a bit too fussy,'' the newspaper quoted McCartney as saying.
	   In a two page interview, The Sun quoted McCartney talking about
his relationship with wife Linda, a photographer and animal rights
campaigner, who was brought up in Scarsdale, New York state.
	   ''As a wife, Linda was the best that anyone could ever want,''
the newspaper quoted McCartney as saying. ''Linda was there for me
all the time and as a lover she was one of the best, She was
comfortable, she was never difficult. We had a lot of fun making
our babies. She was one of the kindest people. She just made you
feel good to be yourself.''
	   Linda Eastwood and Paul McCartney were married in a London
registry office on March 12, 1969, almost two years after the
couple met at the launch of the Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band'' album.
	   In a second, three-page interview, The Daily Mail quoted
McCartney as saying that one week before Linda's death, he knew his
wife only had a few days left to live, but didn't tell her.
	   ''I was the only one who knew. One of the doctors said she ought
to be told but I didn't want to tell her because I didn't think
she'd want to know,'' the newspaper quoted McCartney as saying.
	   Linda McCartney died at the family's ranch in Arizona on April
19.
	   McCartney said the loss of his wife of 30 years hit him so badly
that he sought professional help to deal with his grief, the
newspaper reported.
	   ''I got a counselor because I knew that I would need some help.
He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt.
Whenever anyone you care about dies, you wish you'd been perfect
all the time you were with them. I wasn't. That made me fell very
guilty after Linda died,'' The Daily Mail quoted McCartney as
saying.
	   McCartney also praised his late wife's role as a mother, The Sun
said. The couple had three children. Lady McCartney also had a
child from a previous marriage.
	   ''Linda was also a beautiful mother. She meant everything to
us,'' the newspaper quoted McCartney as saying.
	   ''She felt it was important to be there for the kids so we were
nearly always there to put them to bed each night. We were never
away from them for long periods,'' the newspaper quoted McCartney
as saying.
	   The McCartneys announced in December 1995 that Lady McCartney
had breast cancer. In March the cancer was found to have spread to
her liver. Her ashes were scattered on the family farm south of
London.

Woods wins playoff; Vijay Singh, O'Meara, Westwood also advance

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods knows better than to
bank on playing his Florida neighbor and friend Mark O'Meara in the
Sunday finals of the World Match Play Championship.
	   ``I have my work cut out... and Mark has his work cut out for
him,'' said the flu-ridden Woods.
	   For Woods, there's the small matter of 25-year-old Englishman
Lee Westwood in Saturday's semifinals. He's 21 under in 64 holes of
match play and Friday ousted three-time champion Ernie Els 2 and 1.
	   ``That's not too bad,'' said Woods. ``That going to get the job
done anywhere.''
	   O'Meara _ Masters and British Open champion _ must get by
defending champion and PGA winner Vijay Singh. The Fijian shot
10-under 62 in Friday's first 18 to equal a tournament record en
route to eliminating Patrik Sjoland 7 and 6.
	   O'Meara rallied to beat Colin Montgomerie 5 and 4, but it was
Woods who provided the drama for a record crowd of 17,950 by
knocking out Ian Woosnam 1-up on the 37th and first playoff hole.
	   Woosnam missed four-foot (one-meter) putts on the 34th and 36th
holes _ either would have won it _ and then bogeyed the first
playoff hole as Woods advanced.
	   ``Lucky escape, no doubt about it,'' Woods admitted. ``I got a
lucky break when he ran it by and then lipped it out.''
	   ``I tried to just grind it out on each and every hole,'' said
Woods, who's fighting the bug since arriving in damp Britain for
last week's Dunhill Cup.
	   ``Whether you're sick or not you have to do that. I think
because I was under the weather I was even more aware of that than
normal and tried to concentrate more.
	   Woods coughed his way around the course Friday, not given much
help from an on-and-off mist that threatened all day to break into
full-blown rain.
	   ``The coughing was the main thing,'' Woods said. ``Just trying
not to cough when Ian was playing. When I tired to hold my cough I
started to tear up.''
	   ``Then for a few holes I had to fight a bloody nose.''
	   O'Meara trailed by three holes after 15, but then won nine of
the next 13 to take a six-hole lead on Montgomerie after 28. He
closed him out on the 32nd when they halved the hole.
	   O'Meara had six birdies and an eagle in his comeback stretch.
The eagle came on the par-5 18th when he dropped a 50-foot
(15-meter) putt.
	   ``When I was three down (after 15) I got mad at myself and said
I was going to birdie the next three. I didn't, but I got a birdie
and that eagle for a boost.''
	   The 25-year-old Westwood, who has a chance early next month to
dethrone Montgomerie as the European money champion, led by three
after 18.
	   Els _ in the finals the last four years, winning three _ won the
first four holes on the second 18 to take a two-hole lead, but
Westwood rallied as Els bogeyed the 29th. He squared on the 30th
when he hit a 236-yard (215-meter) 3-wood to two feet (half meter)
for an eagle. He birdied the 31st to go one up and went two up with
another birdie on 34.
	   ``The eagle at 12 (30th overall) was obviously very important
and one of the best shots I've hit in a long time.''
	   ``You just have to beat whoever is in front of you,'' Westwood
added. ``It does not change things because it's Tiger.''
	   Singh, who was 11 up after 21 holes against Sjoland, admitted he
eased up.
	   ``Seve (Ballesteros) once told me, if you're 10 up _ go for
11,'' Singh said. ``But when you're that far ahead it's tough to
keep going.''
	   ``It's fun to play when you're playing that good,'' he added.
``I haven't played that good in a long time. If I keep doing that,
I have a good chance of going all the way through.''

Deadline for Milosevic compliance extended, TV crew sees tanks
</HEADLINE>
heading for border

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ NATO has given President Slobodan
Milosevic another ten days to comply with international demands and
pull his troops out of embattled Kosovo province.
	   The decision on Friday by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to postpone the compliance deadline until Oct. 27 came as the
Yugoslav president met another demand by allowing 2,000 foreign
monitors into the province.
	   Meanwhile a convoy of 144 Serbian army vehicles was seen on a
major road heading east toward the provincial border with Serbia.
Seventeen of the vehicles split from the main convoy and traveled
north through Pristina, the capital.
	   It wasn't immediately clear whether the vehicles, spotted by an
Associated Press Television News crew, made the entire lengthy
journey to the border.
	   The convoy would be the first major withdrawal since Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke reached an agreement Tuesday
intended to prevent NATO forces from attacking Serbian military
targets in Kosovo.
	   NATO officials said the allies wanted to keep the force of about
400 warplanes ready for possible airstrikes, despite the Kosovo
deal struck this week between Milosevic and Holbrooke.
	   ``We are still at some distance from full compliance,'' NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels, Belgium, adding the alliance
had ``clear evidence'' that Serb troops and police normally
stationed elsewhere remained in Kosovo.
	   In Washington, the Clinton administration said Friday that
Yugoslav compliance with the U.S.-brokered agreement on Kosovo was
substantial but not sufficient to head off airstrikes.
	   ``We believe NATO's guns should remain cocked and NATO's
military commander should remain in a position to act,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
	   Meanwhile, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia signed a deal with the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to
allow 2,000 OSCE ``verifiers'' to monitor Milosevic's pledge to
withdraw his troops and allow the return of tens of thousands of
refugees.
	   Under the agreement, the unarmed monitors will be allowed to
roam Kosovo to make sure Milosevic has withdrawn troops and to
reassure ethnic Albanian refugees that it is safe to return home.
	   Meanwhile, NATO spy planes will begin flying over Kosovo shortly
under an agreement signed late Thursday by NATO's supreme allied
commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Yugoslav Army Chief of
Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic.
	   The U2 spy planes may begin flying over Kosovo as early as this
weekend.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw remaining Serb forces from
Kosovo, begin negotiations with ethnic Albanians toward self-rule
in the southern Serbian province, and allow up to 300,000 refugees
to go home.
	   OSCE chairman Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish foreign minister,
said the Yugoslavs had guaranteed the safety of the unarmed force
and that he would ask NATO to do the same. He said he had received
promises from member countries for about 800 volunteers, although
he did not say how long it would take to train, equip and station
them in Kosovo.
	   After meeting with the main ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova, Geremek said in Kosovo's capital Pristina: ``I have
received assurances from Mr. Rugova about his participation in the
peace process.''
	   Rugova said, ``I believe that we can assure that everybody will
take part in this agreement and cooperate with the OSCE mission.
The people of Kosovo are interested in an international presence
that will protect them.''
	   But the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army issued a
statement later in the day, saying it rejects the U.S.-brokered
deal for the strife-torn province.
	   Hashim Thaci, a member of the KLA's political wing, told The
Associated Press that NATO and the U.N. have to force Serb troops
to withdraw ``from all positions'' from where they threaten the
return of refugees and the freedom of movement.
	   ``If this is not done, the KLA will continue the armed struggle
for freedom, independence and democracy,'' Thaci said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed since Milosevic began his
crackdown on Kosovo in February to crush the KLA. Its soldiers have
killed more than 200 Serb policemen, Serb civilians and ethnic
Albanians loyal to Milosevic's government.
	   According to Serb sources, a policeman was killed Thursday
evening near Orahovac, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova, said that Serb
police had killed one Albanian and wounded another on Thursday.
	   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
inhabitants, and most of them favor independence or substantial
self-rule. The United States has been spearheading international
efforts to revive negotiations between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
on the future of the province.
	   The Americans and Europeans, however, oppose the militants'
demand for independence, fearing this could lead to further
instability among ethnic Albanian communities throughout the
southern Balkans.
	   International efforts to get aid to refugees are accelerating in
the wake of the Monday accord and with winter fast approaching.
	   Aid workers said there is enough food and other supplies to
sustain the scattered population during the winter if they can
return to their homes, but meeting medical needs will be a
difficult challenge.

Israel says security key issue; Palestinians say it's a ruse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the week leading up to the Mideast summit,
an Israeli woman soldier was stabbed to death at the gate of her
West Bank settlement and a Jewish seminary student was gunned down
while immersed in an outdoor ritual pool near Jerusalem.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the vicious
killings, blamed on Palestinians, furnish new proof the Palestinian
Authority is not living up to its side of the peace bargain and is
doing very little to combat terrorism.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has shrugged off the blame,
saying he is making an all-out effort to prevent attacks on
Israelis and that no one can demand 100 percent success.
	   The debate has raged since Netanyahu won power in May 1996 on a
promise of bringing his people ``peace with security.''
	   At the Mideast summit, which began Thursday, the United States
will try to get both sides to agree on the criteria for an
anti-terror campaign. The issue may make or break the negotiations
because Netanyahu has said he will not hand over West Bank land
without security guarantees.
	   Security cooperation was a cornerstone of the 1993 autonomy
accords, which envisioned a gradual Israeli withdrawal in exchange
for an end to Palestinian attacks.
	   But the process was marred by violence, with the Islamic
militant group Hamas setting off more than a dozen suicide-bombs.
Scores of Israelis and Palestinians have been killed since 1993,
although the pace of killings has slowed. Since 1997, 12 Israelis
have been slain by Palestinians and 49 Palestinians have been
killed by Israelis, most in clashes with Israeli troops.
	   Both sides accuse the other of posturing in the security debate.
	   The Palestinians say Netanyahu raises more and more security
demands because he wants to wriggle out of the peace agreements he
reluctantly inherited from his dovish predecessors.
	   Palestinian negotiators say the security issue was settled a
year ago when new understandings were negotiated by Israeli,
Palestinian and U.S. officials. Netanyahu scotched the agreement
reached by one of his top generals, saying he was not satisfied.
	   The Israeli leader says Arafat is only paying lip-service to
fighting terrorism.
	   Netanyahu says Palestinian terrorists routinely seek refuge in
Palestinian-controlled areas and in some cases are even recruited
into the Palestinian security forces.
	   At this stage, Arafat appears to be making a serious effort to
prevent large-scale bombings that would wreck the negotiations and
end his hopes of getting more land.
	   Before the summit, which is taking place at a secluded retreat
in Maryland, Arafat's agents summoned Hamas leaders and warned them
they would pay dearly should they try to carry out a bombing. When
Israel sealed the Palestinian areas for much of the past month
because of renewed Hamas threats, Palestinian leaders did not
complain too loudly, despite millions of dollars in lost trade and
wages each day of closure.
	   Arafat is reluctant, however, to meet Israel's demand to wage a
full-scale war on Hamas by raiding mosques and shutting welfare
groups suspected of funneling money to the armed underground.
	   Arafat does not want to be cast in the role of Israel's
enforcer, especially when he doesn't feel he is getting much in
return.
	   He seems to be gauging the public mood correctly. Arafat's
popularity has sunk to 30 percent, while 51 percent of Palestinians
say they support acts of violence against Israel, up 7 percent from
August, according to a survey this week of 1,331 Palestinians.
	   Half the Israelis, in turn, don't expect Arafat to keep any
promises he makes at the summit, said a Gallup poll of 1,000
Israelis published Friday. Both polls had margins of error of 3
percentage points.
	   In such a climate of distrust, it doesn't take a bombing to
trigger new anxiety. About 200 Jewish settlers briefly blocked a
major West Bank highway Friday, complaining that two of their
security chiefs had been detained and roughed up by Palestinian
police the day before.
	   Settler leaders briefed Netanyahu aides at the summit about the
incident and advised against handing more territory over to Arafat
under the circumstances.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's newly elected Social Democrats
and Greens are bogged down on the issue of energy taxes as they try
to come together in a coalition.
	   Party leaders were to debate which taxes to raise _ and by how
much _ again on Saturday after failing to reach a deal by late
Friday night.
	   Both parties in the center-left grouping want to use the
proceeds from higher taxes on gasoline and other fossil fuels to
finance cuts in other levies aimed at bringing down non-wage labor
costs. That, they hope, will spur job creation _ top of their wish
list.
	   The Greens wanted a big jump in gas prices to discourage Germans
drivers from taking their cars out and polluting the air.
	   But Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, wary of hurting the auto
industry, has said he would not accept more than a 6 pfennig (4
cent) a liter increase, far less than the Greens were seeking.
	   Since that wouldn't raise nearly enough to make a significant
dent in the other taxes they want to cut, Greens leader Kerstin
Mueller said it was up to the Social Democrats ``to come and make
new proposals.''
	   Higher taxes on heating oil, electricity and other energy
sources were still being considered.
	   Also on the table for Saturday were social welfare policies and
how to pay for them.
	   Schroeder promised before winning the Sept. 27 election, that he
would rescind planned cuts in social security that were passed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens also want to boost aid for the
elderly and long-time unemployed. But financing on that must also
be hammered out.
	   On Friday the parties agreed on foreign policy.
	   The dominant Social Democrats stressed that the accord pledges
continuity in essential areas, such as firm German support for
NATO, European integration and partnership with the United States.
	   The accord signaled a coming of age for the Greens, a party with
pacifist leanings rooted in the 1980s European peace movement.
Radical demands in their election platform, such as a call for
eventually disbanding NATO, were rejected by the Social Democrats.
	   Most Greens also joined the Social Democrats and Kohl's outgoing
coalition to vote Friday to send German warplanes to join in NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslavia if it fails to comply with this
week's pace accord on Kosovo. The vote passed 500-62.
	   Both sides also said they would honor a commitment made by
Kohl's government backing the Eurofighter military jet.
	   Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy hope to break U.S. domination
in the fighter jet market by cooperating to build their own. Their
first firm order, 14 billion marks (dlrs 8.75 billion) for 148
planes came in September.
	   The two sides also wanted to complete a plan to shut down
Germany's nuclear reactors.
	   Board members of German utilities meeting Friday reiterated
their willingness to enter talks with the new government, while
adding that any agreement would have to be economically as well as
ecologically viable.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Malnutrition in parts of Mexico is comparable
to levels of hunger in the poorest regions in Africa, a government
expert said Friday.
	   Adolfo Chavez, a researcher at the National Nutrition Institute,
said up to 30 percent of the population in certain parts of Mexico
is underweight.
	   In many areas, especially those with significant Indian
populations, poverty has caused people to live on an inadequate
diet based almost exclusively on beans and tortillas, Chavez said.
	   He urged the government to invest 10 cents a day for every poor
family, saying that could dramatically reduce malnutrition among
children.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Only 5 percent of all crimes reported in
Mexico are prosecuted, and only half of all crimes are reported to
authorities, according to Mexico's interior minister.
	   In comments published Friday by Mexico City newspapers,
Francisco Labastida, who is in charge of national security, said 3
million crimes took place last year, but just more than half were
reported because of ``a lack of credibility of the justice
system.''
	   Only 800,000 of the 1.5 million crimes reported were
investigated, and of those, only 80,000 led to arrest warrants,
Labastida said.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's attorney general said
Friday that he would try to prosecute government officials for
leading a state-run bank into bankruptcy.
	   But to carry out the prosecution, Attorney General Julio Centeno
said he would need evidence that was in the hands of the
comptroller general's office.
	   The government released a list Wednesday of individuals and
companies it said were responsible for the bankruptcy of the
National Development Bank, known as Banades. The bank failed in the
1980s, but the government propped it up until last year.
	   The government said the mismanagement also involved officials in
the government of former President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who
served from 1990-97. Presidential spokesman Gilberto Wong said the
names would be released after an audit is conducted by the
comptroller general's office.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's national legislature has
approved constitutional amendments called for in last year's peace
agreement between the government and leftist guerrillas.
	   Lawmakers approved amendments late Thursday pertaining to
military and government reform, the creation of a national police
and the rights of Guatemala's large indigenous population.
	   The amendments will be submitted for ratification in a
referendum scheduled for next year. Legislative approval came after
18 months of negotiations between the ruling National Advance Party
and the opposition.
	   Lawmakers from five opposition parties voted with the ruling
party to approve the amendments, while those from the Guatemalan
Republican front abstained.
	   About 200,000 people were killed or disappeared during the
38-year war between the guerrillas and a succession of
military-backed rightist governments. The war ended Dec. 26, 1996,
with a U.N.-supervised peace agreement.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's cabinet on Friday approved
an economic stabilization fund designed to protect the country and
the nation's budget from dramatic swings in oil prices.
	   Economists have long recommended such a fund, and Friday's
decision is considered landmark legislation.
	   Eighty percent of Venezuela's export revenue comes from oil and
falling prices in recent months have wreaked havoc on the economy.
	   The Macroeconomic Stabilization Fund, which will be held in an
account managed by the Central Bank, will have little impact in the
next few years. It isn't expected to collect any revenues in 1999
due to slumping oil prices and oil production cuts mandated by
agreements with other major oil-exporting countries.
	   Lower world oil prices have forced Venezuela to slash the
national budget by around dlrs 2 billion this year.

Latin American leaders consider their economic woes at summit

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Measures to ward off financial turmoil
that has hit several other countries were at the top of the agenda
for leaders from Latin America, Spain and Portugal as they gathered
Saturday for the annual Ibero-American summit.
	   Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in
recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's
developing economies.
	   An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the
turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue
facing the world at the moment.
	   ``I don't know if we are coming to the end of the world economic
order. It will be interesting to know,'' the Cuban leader said
Friday at a hotel press conference shortly after his arrival in
Portugal.
	   Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said U.S. President
Bill Clinton was aware that ``if South America falls into crisis,
it will be extended inevitably also to the United States,'' which
is heavily involved in investments and loans in the region.
	   Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America
with devastating effects on stock markets and currency reserves.
	   The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and
Portugal will try to figure out how they can shield their economies
from the financial turmoil that already has devastated Asia and
Russia. Stock markets also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy
investors in Latin America.
	   The Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular
reforms of their public finances, including austerity packages
which risk social unrest and political upheaval.
	   A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port
city on the Douro River in northern Portugal.
	   Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory
system for global financial transactions that would place controls
on speculators, like measures to slow down the international flow
of money.
	   They also want reforms that allow international financial
institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with
rescue packages.
	   ``International institutions must be active in tackling crises
like the recent one ... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said.
	   ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in
reference to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their
economies.

National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends drug treatment for
</HEADLINE>
all &QL; 
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The National Multiple Sclerosis Society said
Friday that anyone diagnosed with MS should start drug treatment
immediately rather than the typical approach of waiting for
symptoms to worsen.
	   Although medication exists to treat MS, fewer than 50,000 of the
300,000 Americans who have the often-crippling nerve disease are
taking the three drugs that slow but do not cure MS, society
spokesman Dr. Stanley van den Noort said at the society's
leadership conference.
	   Many doctors are still unfamiliar with the drugs since they've
only been available since 1993. And there remain questions about
the drugs' benefits when weighed against their high cost, effort
and discomfort.
	   But in its first ever treatment recommendation, the society said
all MS patients should be on medication, since it appears that
those who do will likely suffer less disabling symptoms than those
who do not take the medication.
	   The society has provided information about treatments in the
past, but offered no recommendations until now. It has no opinion
on which of the three drugs available _ Avonex, Betaseron and
Copaxone _ is best, said van den Noort, a neurology professor at
the University of California, Irvine, and the society's chief
medical officer.
	   ``Within five or 10 years, I suspect that we'll have something
better,'' van den Noort said. ``But we don't know what it is. And
this is the best thing we've got. And it's safe. And it works. It's
not perfect, but it does reduce the attack rate, and ... there's
pretty good evidence that it does stop the accumulation of
disability.''
	   MS patients typically lose some problem-solving capacity and
short-term memory. The majority end up in wheelchairs or need
assistance with walking, van den Noort said.
	   Multiple sclerosis is caused by the body's own immune system
attacking the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the
protective sheath around nerve fibers. The three MS drugs approved
in recent years work in various ways to trick the immune system
into stopping or slowing the attack, van den Noort said.
	   Each of the three drugs cost about dlrs 1,000 a month and must
be self-injected weekly to daily.
	   Anne Marie Riether, a psychiatrist, wife and mother of three who
was diagnosed with MS five years ago, believes early drug treatment
helped her continue an active life.
	   ``These new drugs ... give us hope,'' said Riether, 43, of
Peachtree City, Georgia, who uses a wheelchair when she is fatigued
and during episodes when symptoms return. ``Before 1993 (when
Betaseron received approval), there were no treatments.
	   ``Having a specific treatment for a specific disease is
insurance,'' she said. ``You do not take out insurance after the
accident, after you get worse. You do it now.''

Scott rejects funding for APEC-related legal expenses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ Solicitor General Andy Scott decided Friday he
won't pay the legal fees of protesters involved in public hearings
into police conduct at last year's APEC summit.
	   However, the inquiry is continuing as scheduled despite earlier
musings by some observers about whether it should be called off.
	   Scott said there was no reason to pay for lawyers for the
protesters because the commission holding the hearings has a
tradition of treating unrepresented complainants with ``respect and
fairness.''
	   ``The government is of the view that the panel can address the
complainants before it in an open and thorough manner without the
need for the government to provide funding,'' he said in a letter
to the RCMP Public Complaints Commission panel.
 &UR; Romanow to legislate end to SaskPower dispute
	   REGINA (AP) _ Saskatchewan's NDP government will legislate an
end to the 3-week-old labor dispute at the province's Crown
electrical utility.
	   Premier Roy Romanow announced Friday that he will ask the
Speaker to recall the legislature Monday so the government can
introduce back-to-work legislation.
	   On Thursday, Romanow issued an ultimatum to SaskPower workers,
demanding that they stop job action and withdraw their strike
mandate.
	   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers agreed to
end their job action campaign of no overtime, but they refused to
give up their right to strike.
	   On Oct. 5, SaskPower management locked out 550 employees at 14
generating plants _ half its unionized workforce.
 &UR; President of medical group stays despite misconduct finding
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The president of the Canadian Medical Association
says he will stay in his post despite having been found guilty of
professional misconduct.
	   Allon Reddoch says the finding is under appeal and he is
confident he will be exonerated.
	   ``My intention is to stay on as president,'' Reddoch said Friday
between sessions of the World Medical Association general assembly.
	   In August a committee of the Yukon Medical Association found
Reddoch guilty of misconduct for failing to adequately care for a
16-year-old Whitehorse girl who died of botulism.
	   After the misconduct finding, Reddoch withdrew his name as
president-elect of the Canadian Medical Association and informed
association officials of the committee finding, although it was not
made public at the time.
	   Association members persuaded him to let his name stand despite
the misconduct ruling and he won the presidency by acclamation at
the general meeting in Whitehorse last month.
 &UR; Salvagers recover Swissair engine
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ Salvagers have recovered one of the three engines
from Swissair Flight 111, a discovery that may help investigators
determine what caused the jetliner to crash.
	   The No. 2 Pratt and Whitney engine was pulled to the surface
this week by an offshore exploration barge that is scooping plane
debris from the ocean floor off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia
	   Investigators probing the cause of the Sept. 2 crash will
``start looking at it probably early next week,'' Jim Harris of the
Transportation Safety Board of Canada said Friday.
	   ``We won't know how important it is until we start looking at it
to find out if it was working at the time of the crash. What was it
doing in the crash sequence? It is another piece of the information
puzzle.''
	   The engine, from the tail of the MD-11, was taken to a military
base outside Halifax. The No. 1 and No. 3 engines, which were
located under the wings, have not been recovered.
 &UR; In short:
	   ST-JEAN, Quebec (AP) _ Liberal Leader Jean Charest endorsed a
plan on Friday to reduce Quebec personal income taxes by $1.3
billion over five years. He also backed an advisory group's
proposal to trim $1.2 billion in business taxes over the same
period. ``This is very much an effort to modernize the state of
Quebec,'' said Charest, who is gearing up for the Quebec general
election planned this fall.
	   WINNIPEG (AP) _ Manitoba performed better than expected in the
first quarter of the fiscal year, but Finance Minister Eric
Stefanson isn't changing his forecast of a $23 million surplus in
1998-99. ``I think the $23 million is still a very realistic
estimate of what our year-end surplus will be,'' Stefanson said
Friday as he released the first-quarter results.
	   NEWMARKET, Ontario (AP) _ Canada's most celebrated dominatrix
wants to get back to what she does best: meting out punishment to
men who ask for it. But first, Terri-Jean Bedford, known as Madame
de Sade, had to accept a punishment of her own. She was fined
$3,000 on Friday for operating a common bawdy house. The fine
concluded a trial that brought the sado-masochistic world out of
the closet and into the spotlight.
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Striking support workers at Pearson International
Airport planned to take down some of their picket lines Friday in
an effort to restart talks at the bargaining table. Earlier, picket
lines at all three parking garages at Canada's busiest airport
delayed passengers for up to 45 minutes.
 &UR; What's Ahead:
	   ST-JEAN, Quebec _ The Quebec Liberals hold a two-day general
council meeting on Saturday and Sunday to discuss this fall's
election. Leader Jean Charest speaks on Sunday.
	   OTTAWA _ Ontario Progressive Conservatives hold a general party
meeting on Saturday and Sunday.

Northern Ireland leaders win joint Peace Prize for Belfast accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble,
joint winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, have traveled
dramatically different roads as brokers of the historic Northern
Ireland accord.
	   For Hume, 61, the single-minded peacemaker who leads the
province's major Catholic party, Friday's honor from the Norwegian
Nobel Committee capped a remarkable career that culminated in an
agreement he envisioned decades ago.
	   For Trimble, 54, embattled chief of the Protestant party pivotal
to the peacemaking efforts, the Nobel was more controversial _
particularly considering the omission of his nemesis, Gerry Adams,
leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   The Oslo Nobel judges previously have used their award to
encourage progress in peacemaking _ most notably in the Middle
East, where Israel's Menachim Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat shared
honors in 1978, and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat joined Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres in 1994.
	   It also has gone to Northern Ireland before _ in 1976, early in
the British province's three decades of strife, it was won by two
women who founded a peace group.
	   Although Hume and Trimble are not friends and their relations
are cool, their work culminated in an agreement ratified by voters
this spring that sets up a new Protestant-Catholic power-sharing
governing structure.
	   Friday's citation _ accompanied by dlrs 963,000, which will be
divided equally between the two men _ credited them for work toward
ending ``the national, religious and social conflict in Northern
Ireland that has cost over 3,500 people their lives.''
	   Of Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, the citation said
he showed ``great political courage when, at a critical stage in
the process, he advocated solutions which led to the peace
agreement.''
	   That included remaining in negotiations when Sinn Fein gained
admission following the Irish Republican Army's 1997 cease-fire,
and agreeing to a deal that would free more than 200 IRA prisoners
without a cast-iron guarantee that the IRA would start disarming.
	   Of Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the
citation said he had ``throughout been the clearest and most
consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his work for
a peaceful solution.''
	   Hume rose to prominence as a 1960s leader of non-violent
Catholic protests for equal rights in what was then a
Protestant-ruled state. From 1970 onwards, he did more than anyone
else to minimize Catholic support for IRA violence, which he argued
only compounded social divisions.
	   Most critically, he weathered huge personal criticism in 1993 by
seeking common ground with Adams, a groundbreaking initiative that
encouraged the IRA's cease-fires and made Hume _ not Adams _
Northern Ireland's most likely Nobel laureate.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton saluted Trimble's
``rare courage,'' but emphasized that other figures ``deserve
credit for their indispensable roles, beginning with Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein leader without whom there would have been no peace.''
	   Clinton also praised former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who
chaired the peace talks.
	   While the Nobel committee noted that April's peace agreement
also was the work of the governments of the United Kingdom, Ireland
and the United States, it did not include any reference to
Mitchell.
	   The Nobel recognized Trimble's risky struggle _ successful so
far _ to keep a slim majority of the north's British Protestants
supporting a peace process that he himself frequently criticized as
offering too many concessions to Sinn Fein and the IRA.
	   ``I hope very much that this award doesn't turn out to be
premature,'' Trimble cautioned in the Colorado capital of Denver,
his latest stop in a week-long push to attract more North American
investment to Northern Ireland.
	   As a young Ulster Unionist, Trimble helped topple the party's
leaders when they tried to govern in coalition with Hume's party in
1973. Today, he must overcome that same reluctance among
Protestants to share power _ not only with Hume but also Sinn Fein,
which until recently denied Northern Ireland's very right to exist.
	   Speaking in Belfast, Hume said Friday's honor represented ``very
powerful international approval of the peace process in Northern
Ireland.''
	   ``I think that today's announcement from the Nobel committee
strengthens our peace process enormously because it tells all the
people what the world wants to see on our streets,'' he said.
	   In New York, Adams _ embroiled in a dangerous showdown with
Trimble over how the peace agreement should proceed _ said he was
not disappointed about his lack of recognition, and voiced pleasure
at Hume's recognition.
	   ``I suppose, you know, the big prize is the peace settlement,
and that's the prize for us all to keep our eye on,'' Adams said.
``The Nobel Peace Prize is only important insofar as it aids the
road and the quest for that bigger prize.''
	   Asked if the committee has shunned Adams because of the IRA's
terrorist history, Francis Sejersted, the Nobel chairman, refused
to discuss the deliberations.
	   ``I can only repeat that many people have contributed to this
process, not in the least Gerry Adams,'' he said.
	   Sejersted said the committee knew that setbacks and renewed
violence still are possible in Northern Ireland, but said the peace
agreement ``indicates that the process is going in on the right
track. We wanted to give it a push.''
	   The peace prize was the last of the six Nobel awards to be named
this year.
	   The economics prize was won Wednesday by Amartya Sen, an Indian
scholar cited for his work in studying the causes of famine and
other catastrophes.
	   On Tuesday, Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L.
Stormer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton
University won the Nobel physics prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior and act more like fluid than
particles.
	   The chemistry prize went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and John A. Pople of Northwestern
University for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last week to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite who established the prizes in his will.

Latin American leaders consider their economic woes at summit

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Measures to ward off financial turmoil
that has hit several other countries were at the top of the agenda
for leaders from Latin America, Spain and Portugal as they gathered
Saturday for the annual Ibero-American summit.
	   Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in
recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's
developing economies.
	   An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the
turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue
facing the world at the moment.
	   ``I don't know if we are coming to the end of the world economic
order. It will be interesting to know,'' the Cuban leader said
Friday at a hotel press conference shortly after his arrival in
Portugal.
	   Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said U.S. President
Bill Clinton was aware that ``if South America falls into crisis,
it will be extended inevitably also to the United States,'' which
is heavily involved in investments and loans in the region.
	   Jittery investors have abruptly pulled cash out of Latin America
with devastating effects on stock markets and currency reserves.
	   The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and
Portugal will try to figure out how they can shield their economies
from the financial turmoil that already has devastated Asia and
Russia. Stock markets also fell in Portugal and Spain, heavy
investors in Latin America.
	   The Latin American leaders must gauge the need for unpopular
reforms of their public finances, including austerity packages
which risk social unrest and political upheaval.
	   A joint declaration will be signed Sunday in this ancient port
city on the Douro River in northern Portugal.
	   Latin America's leaders favor creating some kind of regulatory
system for global financial transactions that would place controls
on speculators, like measures to slow down the international flow
of money.
	   They also want reforms that allow international financial
institutions to head off crises rather than react to them with
rescue packages.
	   ``International institutions must be active in tackling crises
like the recent one ... and contribute to stability,'' Portuguese
Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said.
	   ``Countries that have progressive policies should not be
penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in
reference to Latin American nations' efforts to modernize their
economies.

Mild-mannered Canada plans to flex diplomatic muscle on Security
</HEADLINE>
Council &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Its military is small, its foreign aid budget has
shrunk, yet Canada believes it can be a diplomatic heavyweight
during an upcoming two-year term on the U.N. Security Council.
	   The goals may prove to be overambitious, but for now there is a
keen sense of anticipation. Canadian officials contend their
country is uniquely qualified to serve as bridge-builder between
developed and developing countries, and perhaps to tilt the
Security Council's agenda in some new directions.
	   ``If ever there was an opportunity in the last 30 or 40 years
for Canada to flex its muscles on foreign affairs, this is it,''
said Stephen Lewis, a former Canadian ambassador to the United
Nations.
	   Usually low-key, Canadian diplomats were jubilant after winning
a General Assembly election last week for one of the 10 Security
Council seats allocated to non-permanent members. The term, which
begins Jan. 1, is the first for Canada since 1989-90.
	   While acknowledging that the five permanent members _ the United
States, Russia, China, France and Britain _ have ultimate sway
because of their veto power, the Canadians see a vital role for
themselves as a voice for countries not on the Security Council.
	   Canada's activist foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, already has
won praise worldwide for his pivotal role in advancing a treaty to
ban land mines. He says Canada will use its Security Council seat
to further this initiative, combat the exploitation of women and
children and raise an array of other issues dealing with what he
calls ``human security.''
	   ``These are things that really matter to people,'' he said.
	   Axworthy pledged that Canada would consult closely with
countries not on the Security Council, and strive to make its
operations more democratic.
	   ``The Security Council is going to have to be less of a closed
shop,'' he said.
	   One of Canada's challenges will be to build alliances with the
other non-permanent council members, according to Danilo Turk, the
U.N. ambassador for Slovenia, which is almost midway through its
own two-year term.
	   ``Individual countries cannot do very much, but a group can make
a difference,'' Turk said. ``Very often the permanent members
modify their views if they see a substantial number of
non-permanent members are putting forward some particular view...
in that sense Canada would be an interesting player.''
	   Canada's relationship with the United States on Security Council
matters will likely be a mix of close cooperation and occasional
disputes. Though loyal allies when it comes to almost any security
crisis, the two nations have agreed to disagree on a range of
issues, including the Canada-backed land-mine ban and the U.S.
embargo of Cuba.
	   ``We're delighted that Canada has been elected to the Security
Council,'' said Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   ``Canada has been a leader in peacekeeping operations and very
creative thinking about conflict prevention and post-conflict
development which are key issues for the U.N. to think about in the
future.''
	   Bob Mills, a Canadian Parliament member who handles foreign
affairs for the right-wing Reform Party, hopes Canada doesn't
squander its opportunities.
	   He advises Canada to avoid getting sidetracked on U.N. reform
proposals and focus instead on a few issues where it could play a
vital role. One that intrigues him is serving as an all-purpose
mediator in the ongoing disputes between India and Pakistan.
	   More powerful nations would have a much harder time maintaining
the trust of both rivals, Mills said.
	   ``We could play a really important role,'' he said. ``We don't
have the baggage, we don't have a colonial past, we've never been
aggressive, we have a good reputation.''
	   Canada's Security Council performance will be scrutinized by the
Canadian Council for International Cooperation, an independent
watchdog that has chided Ottawa for reducing foreign aid in recent
years.
	   ``There is a lot of pressure coming from southern countries for
the U.N. to become more open and democratic. Canada has been able
to play a bridge-builder role between north and south, and I hope
they can play a leadership role on the Security Council,'' said
Betty Plewes, the group's president.
	   Plewes said Canada could send an important signal to developing
nations by reversing a decline in foreign aid. Canada dropped last
year from fifth to 11th among major donor nations in the percentage
of gross national product devoted to foreign aid.
	   ``It would be a very statesmanlike gesture to increase aid,''
Plewes said.

Salvagers recover Swissair engine off coast of Nova Scotia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Salvagers have recovered one of
three engines from Swissair Flight 111 and plan to begin examining
it next week for clues to why the jetliner crashed.
	   A barge scooping debris from the ocean floor off Nova Scotia's
coast pulled the No. 2 Pratt and Whitney engine to the surface this
week, more than six weeks after the Sept. 2 crash that killed all
229 people aboard.
	   ``We won't know how important it is until we start looking at it
to find out if it was working at the time of the crash,'' Jim
Harris of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said Friday.
	   The engine, from the tail of the MD-11, was taken to a military
base outside Halifax. The No. 1 and No. 3 engines, which were
located under the wings, have not been recovered.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, meanwhile, said rumors that a
large quantity of gold and cash had been retrieved were false.
	   Cash and jewelry has been pulled from recovered debris from time
to time, but there has been no big find, RCMP spokesman Sgt. Bill
Price said.
	   ``That's the least of our priorities,'' Price said. ``We're
still trying to recover human remains and plane debris to help
establish the cause.''
	   Swissair confirmed last month that the jet, which crashed en
route from New York to Geneva, was carrying diamonds and bundles of
cash destined for a Swiss bank as a well as a Picasso painting.
Investigators have said they have found pieces of the painting.

Council welcomes envoy's progress in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council welcomed the progress
made by the U.N. envoy for Afghanistan in getting a pledge from the
country's Taliban militia to release detained Iranians.
	   But the council on Friday also expressed concern at the
``continuing use of Taliban-controlled territory for the
cultivation of drugs and for the sheltering and training of
terrorists.''
	   The United Nations estimates that heroin of Afghan origin
accounts for 80 percent of the European market and 20 percent of
the American.
	   The mention of terrorists appeared to be a reference to Osama
bin Laden, who the United States suspects of being behind the twin
embassy bombings in Africa this summer and has been living in
Afghanistan as a guest of the Taliban. Bin Laden's training camp
was the target of a U.S. cruise missile attack in August.
	   U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi held more than three hours of
meetings Wednesday with Mullah Mohammed Omar at the Taliban
headquarters in southern Afghanistan to try to defuse border
tensions between Iran and the Taliban army.
	   Omar pledged to release Iranians held captive, Brahimi said.
	   Iran has deployed more than 270,000 Iranian soldiers along its
border with Afghanistan along with hundreds of tanks and scores of
fighter jets.
	   The deployment followed the killing in August of eight Iranian
diplomats and an Iranian journalist by renegade Taliban troops in
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

Tway breezes on windy day for Vegas lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Bob Tway wants to play in only one more golf
tournament this year. He's trying to make sure it won't be next
week at Disney World.
	   Tway shot a 3-under-par 69 in gusty conditions Friday to move
into sole possession of the lead in the Las Vegas Invitational _
and one round closer to his goal of making it into the
season-ending Tour Championship.
	   Tway overcame three three-putts to get to 14-under 202 and take
a two-shot lead over Davis Love III, Jim Furyk and David Ogrin on a
day when winds gusting to 40 mph (64 kmph) sent most third-round
scores soaring at the TPC Summerlin course. Mark Calcavecchia led a
group of four golfers another stroke back.
	   Tway is on the bubble for the Tour Championship _ which takes
the top 30 on the money winning list. He committed to play in the
Disney tournament only to make sure he's able to retain or improve
on his No. 30 ranking.
	   He won't be heading for Florida, though, if he wins in Las
Vegas.
	   ``I'd like to not play and instead go home and rest and practice
for a week,'' Tway said. ``The only reason I committed next week
was I wasn't sure I'd make the top 30.''
	   Tway, who shared the lead with Ogrin, and Robert Damron after
two rounds, made four birdies in his third straight round in the
60s. It could have been even better, but for the 3-putts.
	   Two of them came on par-5s where Tway had reached the green in
two.
	   ``I really felt like I putted well,'' he said. ``But the greens
are so fast that putting is more difficult in the wind.''
	   Tway, whose best finish this year was third in the U.S. Open,
has won dlrs 850,823 in what he called his most consistent year on
tour. But he hasn't been in contention often enough to win.
	   ``The only disappointing thing is I haven't had many chances to
win a golf tournament,'' he said. ``Having a chance at this
tournament with a couple of days to go is great.''
	   Friday's winds helped push up scores in a tournament where
winners commonly shoot five rounds in the 60s. The low round of the
day was a 68, by Love and two others.
	   ``I hit the ball low being from Oklahoma so that helps me in the
wind,'' Tway said. ``I don't have to change my trajectory much.''
	   The tournament, a pro-am spread over the first three rounds at
three courses, now moves to the TPC Summerlin course for the final
two rounds.
	   Love, who played at the more sheltered Las Vegas Country Club,
missed a 6-foot (1.8-meter) eagle putt on the last hole that would
have put him within a shot of the lead. Love's 68 put him in prime
position once again in a tournament he won in 1993 and lost in a
playoff to Tiger Woods in 1996.
	   ``This tournament has been very good to me,'' Love said. ``You
have to shoot low scores here and I know I can shoot low scores.''
	   Love has only one win this year, at the MCI Classic, but has
still won more than dlrs 1.2 million in 18 tournaments.
	   ``It's a disappointing year because I didn't win but one
tournament, but I had some back problems so I was kind of iffy most
of the year,'' he said. ``It's obviously not a lost year. But it's
not what I wanted. I wanted major championships and player of the
year kind of stuff.''
	   Furyk shot a 69 to get to 204, while Ogrin had a 71.

Three-way tie for Gold Rush lead

	   EL DORADO HILLS, California (AP) _ Despite gusty winds
throughout the day, John Schroeder, Kurt Cox and Jim Albus managed
3-under-par 69s Friday in the opening round of Raley's Gold Rush
Classic.
	   Fred Gibson, Terry Dill and Tommy Aaron were all at 70 as only
16 of the 78 golfers in the Senior PGA Tour field broke par.
	   The 6,776-yard (6,166-meter) course at Serrano Country Club is
considered difficult in normal conditions, but winds gusting to 30
mph (48 kmph) made for a treacherous day of golf.
	   Lee Trevino rallied on the back nine with three birdies to
finish with an even-par 72 to join Jay Sigel, the tour's
fourth-leading money leader, and Jim Colbert, last week's winner at
The Transamerica.
	   Defending champion Bob Eastwood had birdies on two of the final
three holes in a 73 and was tied with Gary Player and Raymond
Floyd.
	   Schroeder started a morning round with two birdies and also
birdied No. 9 to go three under on the front side.
	   ``This is British Open-type golf, especially that back nine,''
Schroeder said. ``You can't figure out what the wind is doing a lot
of times.''
	   Albus also started fast with birdies on the three of the first
five holes.
	   ``The hardest thing on a day like this is putting,'' Albus said.
``It adds another dimension you have to factor with the wind. I've
been putting poorly the last couple of months. Basically I putted
darn good today.''
	   So did Cox, who made consecutive birdie putts on Nos. 4 and 5.
He added two more birdies on the back nine and nearly found himself
with sole possession of the lead, but came up short on a birdie
attempt on 18.
	   While many players grew irritated with the conditions, Cox felt
at ease.
	   ``I grew up playing in the wind in Texas, I think it's to my
advantage having played a lot in the wind,'' he said.
	   Missing from the field for the first time in the tournament's
12-year history was Chi Chi Rodriguez. The charismatic senior tour
veteran is resting in a Sacramento hospital, recovering from an
angioplasty procedure earlier in the week.

	   HERMANUS, South Africa (AP) _ Jaci Negra gets some unusual
guests at her seaside restaurant. They are longer than a bus, weigh
more than a tank and eat three tons of food a day.
	   They are southern right whales, whose growing numbers in South
African waters are making the resort of Hermanus one of the most
popular spots in the world for whale watching.
	   Negra's restaurant, the Bientang Cave, is right on the shore
beneath the bayside cliffs. Guests sit down to dinner just a
stone's throw from the frolicking, blue-black behemoths.
	   ``Last year we had a lot of calving and mating in front of the
restaurant,'' she says, laughing. ``They make a lot of noise. You
never get used to it.''
	   Once a fishing village that played host to whaling ships in its
tiny harbor, Hermanus is again becoming dominated by whales.
	   Each September since 1991, the town of 20,000 residents has held
a Whale Festival. This year the festival, which ran from Sept. 24
to Oct. 4, attracted more than 100,000 visitors.
	   Tourists throng the cliffs around the town during the festival,
all staring out to sea as if engaged in some sort of religious
ritual.
	   As a whale suddenly breaks the surface, leaps gracefully into
the air and comes crashing back into the water, people gasp and
point at the huge splash.
	   ``Look at that! Wow! They're showing off,'' exclaimed Jane
Emory, 34, an American tourist from Washington D.C.
	   At the harbor museum, a microphone attached to a sonar buoy out
in the ocean relays the eerie sounds of the whales calling to each
other.
	   All of the whale watching is done from the cliffs. Tour boats
are not allowed out to disturb the mammals, although that policy is
under review.
	   In the town itself, businesses pick up the whale theme. From the
Virtual Whale Internet Cafe to the Prince of Whales Coffee Shop,
everyone is cashing in on Hermanus' biggest attraction.
	   But accommodations are inexpensive in Hermanus. The Windsor
Hotel charges 286 rand (dlrs 48) a night for a double room with
seaside views of the whale-watching areas and there are a number of
bed-and-breakfast establishments with rates that range from 50 to
100 rand (dlrs 9 to 17) per person.
	   There is also a wide range of restaurants and, not surprisingly,
seafood is a specialty. The Cape area of South Africa is famous for
its oysters, but if you prefer fish there are the local favorites,
such as klingklip and butterfish.
	   A typical local South African dish is bobotie, a layer of spiced
mince covered with a lasagne-like topping.
	   The staffs at all hotels and restaurants speak English.
	   The southern right whale was almost hunted to extinction in the
early part of the 19th century as French, British and American
whaling fleets plied the southern Atlantic Ocean from South African
ports.
	   Dubbed the ``right whale'' to catch due to their high oil
content and because they floated when dead, the slow-moving
creatures were an easy target for harpoons.
	   Reduced to a population of about 300, the species was first
protected in 1935. But with some illegal whaling still being
carried out until the early 1970s, their numbers are only now
beginning to reach a healthy level again.
	   Out of a global population of more than 5,000, about 2,000 right
whales visit South Africa's southern coast between June and
November each year. Fleeing the freezing winters around Antarctica,
they come to breed and give birth in warmer water before heading
back to their summer feeding grounds.
	   Peter Best, a whale specialist with the University of Pretoria's
Mammal Research Institute, says the southern right whale population
has been growing at 7 percent a year since the mid-1970s.
	   ``We have more whales in our waters now than perhaps at any time
since 1850,'' he says. ``It is a very encouraging thought.''
	   Best heads a team of researchers monitoring the whales. With the
population growing, their focus has changed from studying whale
fertility watching to studying the effects of pollution. Also, they
are concerned about the increased number of collisions with boats
and ships that comes with greater numbers of whales.
	   ``They are doing well as a population and so they will face an
increasing interaction with humans as their numbers grow,'' he
says.
	   But British zoologist Mark Cawardine, author of a book on whale
watching who has come to Hermanus for the last eight years, says
the whale numbers are still low.
	   In Walker Bay, where Hermanus lies, one could see 400 to 500
whales at a time two centuries ago, he says. ``Now it is amazing if
you see 40 to 50. That is still a big difference.''
	   Cawardine, who has traveled the world to study whales from
Alaska to Mexico, believes whale watching is becoming one of the
fastest-growing tourism industries in the world.
	   Last year 6 million people worldwide went whale watching. In
Iceland, which still hunted fin whales as late as 1989, there are
now 13 different tour operators catering to 40,000 annual whale
watchers.
	   ``It is becoming big business,'' Cawardine says. ``Whale
watching is in some areas more economically important now than
whale hunting was in the past.''

Bowman on hand as Red Wings raise second straight Stanley Cup

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings hoisted a ninth Stanley Cup
banner to the rafters of Joe Louis Arena Friday night in a loud and
emotional ceremony before their National Hockey League home opener
against the St. Louis Blues.
	   ``We showed American how to celebrate when the Red Wings won the
Stanley Cup,'' Detroit mayor Dennis Archer told a crowd of nearly
20,000.
	   Cheers continued as the players were introduced. A huge roar
went up when injured defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov was wheeled
onto the ice, right behind No. 96, Tomas Holmstrom.
	   The biggest cheer of the night went up when coach Scotty Bowman
stepped through the tunnel, behind assistants Dave Lewis and Barry
Smith.
	   It was the first time since mid-June that the players had seen
Bowman, who is recovering from heart and knee surgery. Bowman,
looking much thinner, smiled and made a small wave.
	   Bowman had spent the day at Beaumont Hospital undergoing a
stress checkup. The results of those tests will determine whether
he returns to coach again. Bowman watched the game from the private
box of team owner Mike Ilitch.
	   ``We have to wait for the results to come back,'' general
manager Ken Holland said during the first intermission. ``I only
got to speak to him briefly, but all in all, he seems pretty
happy.''
	   Holland said it might be a week or two before the test results
are known.
	   ``After that, I'm sure Scotty will do what he feels is right,''
Holland said.
	   Bowman, who turned 65 on Sept. 18, has said in recent interviews
that he is leaning toward returning for a shot at an unprecedented
ninth Cup championship. That would break a record he shares with
his mentor, Toe Blake.
	   Bowman also would earn dlrs 970,000 to coach, not including a
dlrs 200,000 bonus should he win another title. The alternative
would be dlrs 250,000 for an unspecified front-office position.
	   It was a special moment for Konstantinov, who was on the ice
with his teammates, enjoying what he missed a year ago because of
brain stem injuries received in a limousine crash six days after
the Red Wings had clinched their first Cup in 42 years.
	   Team masseur Sergei Mnatsakonov, left partially paralyzed in the
same crash, also was on hand for the ceremonies. The Red Wings had
both their names engraved on the Cup as part of the 1998 team.
	   The two injured men were always on the minds of the players who
dedicated the 1997-98 season to them.
	   After the Stanley Cup was unveiled at center ice, team captain
Steve Yzerman hoisted it over his head and led the players _ plus
the two men in wheelchairs _ toward the north end of the stadium.
	   There, they watched as Ilitch, who missed last year's ceremony
because of pneumonia, pulled a protective sheet off the banner.
Ilitch, the Little Caesar's pizza magnate who also owns baseball's
Detroit Tigers, applauded like everyone else as the banner went
skyward amid deafening cheers.

Asia-Pacific countries vow to protect seas, study global warming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ Declaring that the health of their economies
depends on the health of their oceans, 17 Asia-Pacific countries
agreed to curb coastal pollution, sustain fish stocks and share
research into global climate change.
	   Members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum _
including the United States, Japan, China and Mexico _ also agreed
Friday to coordinate aquaculture efforts, halt the use of cyanide
and dynamite to catch fish and compile an inventory of fishing
vessels plying their waters.
	   This is the first time APEC, which accounts for half of the
world's trade, has drafted a specific plan for ocean issues. The
sea is responsible for 9 percent of the region's economy.
	   ``We know the economies of the APEC region are dependent on the
ocean for food, raw materials and recreation revenues,'' said D.
James Baker, head of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) and chair of the APEC Oceans Conference.
	   ``This agreement brings us one step closer to ensuring a
sustainable fishery, more viable natural resource and a healthier
coastal zone.''
	   Friday's agreement will be presented to the APEC heads of state
for their approval at next month's summit in the Malaysian capital
of Kuala Lumpur. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to attend.
	   The APEC declaration also previews the April meeting of the
United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development, which will
focus on oceans issues.
	   ``The essential underlying message that we have is that when
you're in difficult times, as we are now in difficult times, you
forget the concepts of sustainable development at your peril,''
said New Zealand's Bill Mansfield, special representative of the UN
commission chairman.
	   The oceans declaration comes a month after APEC leaders failed
to negotiate a trade pact for the region, partly because of oceans
issues. One sticking point was Japan's refusal to open its
fisheries to foreign competition.
	   Japanese officials here refused to comment on those discussions.
	   On Friday, APEC officials reaffirmed their commitment to
implement the 1995 global agreement on curbing land-based pollution
from farming, sewage treatment, urbanization and industries such as
logging and mining.
	   Such pollution runs off into coastal waters, killing marine life
and even the waters themselves.
	   ``This problem of changing ocean chemistry is one of the most
serious environmental problems we face,'' Baker said. ``The input
of nutrients or persistent toxic chemicals has altered some coastal
and marine waters so much they have become more susceptible to
harmful algal blooms, fish kills and oxygen depletion.''
	   One such algal bloom is red tide, a microscopic organism that
colors the sea and can be toxic to humans and marine life. It is
suspected of killing pearl oysters in Japan, manatees and dolphins
in the United States, sea turtles off Mexico and farm fish in Hong
Kong.
	   Forum participants agreed to identify their pollution problems,
exchange information on managing them and identify sources of
funding for possible solutions.
	   ``In any area of activity related to the ocean it will become
more and more important for us that such activity should be based
on the newest available information or knowledge,'' said Masakazu
Murakami, director of the Ocean and Earth Division of Japan's
Science and Technology Agency.
	   Countries also agreed to cooperate on ensuring the viability of
world fisheries. The world ocean catch is valued at about dlrs 80
billion a year, and aquaculture adds another dlrs 42 billion.
	   Fisheries employ about 200 million people worldwide.
	   APEC nations said they would aggressively implement the Code of
Conduct for Responsible Fisheries adopted by the United Nations'
Food and Agriculture Organization. The code aims to minimize
fisheries' impacts on stocks, ecosystems and cultures.
	   The nations also declared they would work with FAO on reducing
the incidental killing of seabirds, protecting sharks and easing
pressure on fish stocks.
	   APEC's members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru join next month.

An end appears near for South America's war-threatening border

dispute &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Latin American leaders were optimistic
as the presidents of Brazil, Chile and Argentina and a U.S. envoy
prepared to begin hammering out a peace agreement Saturday to end
the region's last remaining war-threatening border dispute.
	   ``A definite solution is now very near,'' Chilean President
Eduardo Frei said at a press briefing here Friday. His country is
one of four guarantor nations to a 1942 treaty that ended a war
between Peru and Ecuador, but failed to satisfy a dispute over a
short section of their jungle border.
	   Presidents of three of the guarantor nations _ Brazil, Chile and
Argentina _ expected in Oporto for Sunday's Ibero-American Summit _
agreed to meet Saturday, Frei said. They were expected to be joined
by special U.S. envoy Luigi Einaudi.
	   Hopes for a quick solution came Friday when legislators in Peru
and Ecuador approved proposals from their respective presidents to
accept any plan drawn up by the guarantor nations.
	   The legislation meant that the four countries can impose a final
solution on the two Andean nations.
	   ``I don't see how it could fail now,'' said Alfredo Chiaradia,
Argentine under secretary of Latin American Affairs, who is
directly involved in the negotiations.
	   ``In four, five or six days we will be able to present a
proposal that implies the signing of a peace accord,'' Chiaradia
said.
	   The 57-year-old dispute has erupted in war between Ecuador and
Peru three times, most recently in 1995. Tensions flared again in
August when Peru accused 300 Ecuadorian troops of entering its
territory.
	   Analysts estimate there are 100,000 land mines still in the
area.
	   Presidents Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Jamil Mahaud of Ecuador
met with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington earlier this
month and got his promise to help find a solution to the dispute.
They told him they had made substantial progress toward completing
a peace agreement, but remained at odds over delineating the actual
border area.
	   The border region, in the Cordillera del Condor mountains in the
highlands of the Amazon jungle, is potentially rich in petroleum
and minerals.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific at a time when their jungle border was undefined.
After Peru won in 1942, the two sides established a 1,088-mile
(1,751-kilometer) border.
	   But with only 49 miles (79 kilometers) of border left to mark,
Ecuador stopped the process, declaring the agreement only partially
applied. Peru and Ecuador fought a short war in 1981 and again in
1995 over the area.

 &UR; Hervey Bay is a prime spot for hobnobbing with humpbacks &QL;

 &UR; By ROBYN HOLLAND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HERVEY BAY, Australia (AP) _ As the humpback whale surfaces at
the stern of the boat, Mimi Macpherson leans out over the bright
blue water, tosses her hair and smiles broadly.
	   It's a perfect day aboard her 82-foot (25-meter) catamaran,
Discovery One, with scores of tourists on board.
	   The weather is warm, the sea is calm and two awesome young
humpbacks have spent an hour and a half playing next to the boat,
to the delight of the excited passengers, cameras and videocams in
hand, experiencing their first close encounters with whales.
	   Macpherson has been operating her whale-watch cruises in
Queensland's Hervey Bay, 180 miles (300 kilometers) north of
Brisbane, since 1989 when a marine park was established here.
	   As the younger sister of one of the world's most-famous models,
Elle Macpherson, Mimi got an extraordinary amount of publicity when
she started her business. She used it to her advantage, and, along
with her business prowess, created a successful operation which
recently won tourism industry awards.
	   Discovery One, one of 15 whale-watch boats on Hervey Bay, takes
out up to 270 people each day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during the
whale watch season. The cost of 75 Australian dollars (dlrs 44) for
adults and 40 Australian dollars (dlrs 23) for children includes a
buffet lunch.
	   There is a full bar and a ``child's corner,'' with toys, books
and educational items.
	   ``It was really a fluke _ excuse the pun _ the way I got into
whale watching,'' Macpherson says. ``I was working for a charter
boat company in Sydney Harbor and its owners decided to take it up
to Hervey Bay when the marine park was set up, so I just went with
them.
	   ``I started by scrubbing potatoes and cleaning the galley, then
eventually the boys let me put the sails up and I made a really
good decky (deckhand). Then I did administration and marketing for
them and it just flowed from there. After two years I had developed
a well-rounded knowledge of the whole industry.''
	   An estimated 1,500 to 1,800 humpback whales migrate annually
3,100 miles (4,990 kilometers) from Antarctic waters to the warmer
tropical waters of the Great Barrier Reef in June, where they mate
and give birth. Between August and November, many of these whales
are seen in Hervey Bay, where they rest before heading south again.
	   Experts believe the whales may choose Hervey Bay for its calm,
shallow and warm waters, which helps give the calves time to
develop a layer of protective blubber in readiness for colder
waters,
	   Another theory is that the bay provides a haven for the whales
who are stressed after birthing and mating.
	   Luree LeFrancis, a naturalist and educator for the Pacific Whale
Foundation based in Maui, Hawaii, spends the whale watch season on
Mimi's boat. She says the humpbacks are believed to be returning at
an increasing rate of 4 percent to 5 percent a year.
	   ``I think tourism, if it's done anything at all, has raised
awareness of whales,'' LeFrancis says. ``Whale watching is a big
part of helping save the humpbacks.''
	   The estimated population of humpbacks in Australian waters
before large-scale commercial whaling began in the 19th century was
10,000. When whaling ceased in 1963, the species was under threat
of extinction, with only a few hundred believed to remain. Now, the
estimated population is thought to be 1,800.
	   LeFrancis says Hervey Bay is a unique whale-watching location.
	   ``This is one of the best places I've ever come to watch whales
doing different types of behaviors,'' she says. ``People can get a
really neat close encounter with them here. It's the only place
I've seen the humpback whales get really curious about the boats,''
she explains.
	   ``In Hawaii, they tend to be more aggressive and they're not as
relaxed as they are here. They're on the surface more here because
the water is only 66 feet deep, which is often the size of a
whale.''
	   Macpherson adds: ``From a commercial point of view we know this
is the best location in the world for seeing whales.''
	   Living in her sister's limelight has created opportunities for
her, Macpherson says, but it's also worked against her at times.
	   ``A lot of people think I've been given the boat just because
Elle is rich _ that I haven't worked for it, which is not true,''
she says.
	   (She didn't say what she paid for the boat, but one broker at
Hervey Bay estimated its value at dlrs 870,000.)
	   ``But it does help in one way to be Elle's sister because people
feel like they know you,'' says Macpherson, who recently landed a
guest role in the TV series ``Baywatch.''
	   ``There's a sense of knowing the quality is going to be there
because the name has quality attached to it.''
	   She says she never loses enthusiasm for her work.
	   ``The people I meet are just as interesting as the whales,'' she
says. ``It's the people who make it special. I love being part of
the experience with them.
	   ``Some people come up to me at the end of the trip and say:
'Mimi, I could die happy now, because I've done what I've wanted to
do. Thanks for making it happen.'''

Henry has a deal to buy Marlins; announcement must wait

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Millionaire investment manager John Henry has
completed an agreement to buy the Florida Marlins, but Major League
Baseball wants to delay the long-awaited announcement a few days
longer.
	   Following 2 1/2 months of sometimes acrimonious negotiations,
Henry wrapped up the deal to purchase the troubled franchise from
Wayne Huizenga for dlrs 150 million, a source close to the talks
said Friday.
	   Henry scheduled a conference call with the media for Saturday,
then postponed it a short time later. The reason: Major League
Baseball doesn't permit major announcements during the World
Series, which begins Saturday night in New York.
	   Henry plans to attend the series. The 49-year-old Boca Raton
investor owns 1 percent of the American League champion New York
Yankees but will sell his share in the team if he becomes the
Marlins' owner.
	   Two aides to Huizenga were in New York this week to meet with
Henry and close the deal.
	   Approval of the sale by major league owners is expected to be a
formality. Henry earlier said he hoped to win approval by Oct. 31,
but it's more likely he'll become the owner early next year. Recent
franchise sales have taken at least four months to win approval
after an agreement was reached.
	   Nonetheless, the agreement between Henry and Huizenga will allow
the Marlins to proceed with offseason decisions about player
personnel and marketing for the 1999 season.
	   Sale negotiations briefly reached an impasse last month, and
Huizenga accused Henry of ``chickening out'' of the deal. Huizenga
was angry that Henry complained publicly about the snag in their
talks.
	   Within days, Henry agreed to Huizenga's demands on the two
issues blocking an agreement.
	   Huizenga, who founded the expansion franchise in 1993, put it on
the market in June 1997. He claimed that the Marlins lost dlrs 34
million last year despite winning the World Series, and he ordered
the roster dismantled.
	   This year Florida finished 54-108, the worst record in the
National League since 1969.

Molokai Ranch offers visitors some unusual experiences

<TEXT>
	   MOLOKAI RANCH, Hawaii (AP) _ This parched pasture of thorny
shrubs and dry grass looks like the last place in the world to find
a relaxing Hawaii vacation, much less Molokai's gentle kind of
aloha.
	   Yet fourth-generation Molokai cowboy Jimmy Duvachelle Sr. is out
here smiling and shaking hands with the tourists who started
invading this unspoiled place a year and a half ago. He tells us to
call him ``Uncle Jimmy'' the way the real ranch hands do.
	   The weather-worn paniolo (cowboy) explains to us city slickers
in our telltale clean sneakers that our job today is to drive his
cattle. Herding tames the cows, he says, so they don't quit eating
or go berserk during shipping to the Mainland.
	   This is one of the more unusual events among the array of land
and ocean activities offered to guests on the 54,000-acre
(21,900-hectare) Molokai Ranch, the island's newest tourist
attraction.
	   We're pumped. We saddle up thinking cattle stampedes, Clint
Eastwood, ``Bonanza.''
	   Then we 10 dudes meet our 19 little heifers, sad-faced yearlings
mooing plaintively in a pen. That's not even two baby cows for
every wannabe cowboy.
	   So much for the stampede.
	   Yet the drive is unexpectedly exhilarating. We ride over 3 miles
(5 kilometers) of pasture lands with spellbinding bird's-eye views
of the ocean and neighboring islands. Ranch hand Tessa Reich
teaches us little tricks for herding cows and riding horses. The
heifers kick Molokai's rust-red dirt in our faces. We laugh at the
hyperactive antics of Abby, Reich's catahoula hound puppy.
	   And when the drive is over and we are full up with more sun and
fresh air and wide open spaces than we normally get in a year, only
then do we understand how Uncle Jimmy meant it when he said,
``We're so happy when people come to visit. We get to show what the
real Molokai is about. We get to share with you all the wonderful
things that we used to take for granted on the ranch.''
	   Far away from the mai tais and the luau-show spotlights, Molokai
Ranch is quietly carving its own niche in Hawaii's budding
eco-tourism trade. If few people are aware that the 100-year-old
ranch has entered the visitor business, it may be because the
venture is so unusual for Hawaii.
	   For starters, Molokai Ranch is part dude ranch, with horseback
activities running side-by-side with the ranch's active beef
operation of 6,000 cattle.
	   But the ranch is geared to the outdoors, with a menu of
activities from kayaking to hiking, deep-sea fishing to mountain
biking.
	   It's also a unique venture in a kind of upscale eco-camping,
where guests sleep in tents that are both designed to respect the
environment and outfitted somewhat like hotel rooms.
	   One of Molokai Ranch's most remarkable aspects, however, may be
its peacefulness.
	   It begins to descend on you from the very start of the drive to
your camp. There are no high-rises, only ocean and rugged pasture
land stretching into the horizon, and miles (kilometers) of empty
red-dirt and coral roads, where shy quail and francolins skitter
into the brush, and pueo, or Hawaiian owls, stare you down like
sentries, and cows are the only ones you ever hear grumbling.
	   There is no traffic; a few shuttle vans take guests to every
activity. There are no crowds, only a few guests who want rest and
privacy as badly as you do, and friendly staff who learned
hospitality not from a manual, but from kupuna, or elders, who
taught them the graceful traditions of the place nicknamed the
Friendly Isle.
	   There is no racket. At night, silence feels thick in your ears.
The clean air slips easily into your lungs. You become sharply
aware of the ocean and sky moving with you. Sleep comes deeply.
	   There are still the occasional glitches. Our first van driver,
for instance, drove off forgetting to unload our bags. ``I guess
this isn't New York,'' one frustrated guest remarked.
	   But the bags also were delivered to our very doorsteps a few
hours later completely intact, which probably wouldn't have
happened in New York, either.
	   Half the novelty of staying at Molokai Ranch is bedding down in
its funky ``tentalows'' (bungalow-like tents built on platforms)
and yurts (round, domed tents). Guests choose from three campsites
separated by miles (kilometers) of rugged plains and huge
differences in personality.
	   Kapuoa Beach Camp, which opened recently on the island's west
shore, can seem like a beach-vacation fantasy even to kamaaina
(Hawaii residents). Forty pairs of tentalows are near two perfectly
clean crescent beaches. One crescent frames a sapphire bay good for
swimming, snorkeling, and sunning; the other is dotted with lava
rocks that protect crystal tide pools teeming with fish.
	   Kolo Cliffs Camp, which opened 11 months ago on a rugged bluff
overlooking Molokai's south shore, seems made for adults craving an
escape. Twenty yurts are spaced widely around the cliffs almost
over the ocean. From your deck on a clear day, you can easily see
Lanai, Maui and the Big Island, and, in season, breaching whales
and spinning dolphins. An easy five-minute walk brings you down to
the beach.
	   Paniolo Camp, the first camp to open _ in February 1997 _ is a
popular lodging for families. Forty-one tentalow units are nestled
among whispering ironwood trees half a mile (about one kilometer)
from Maunaloa town, close to the trail head for mountain biking.
The camp is designed with a paniolo theme and built close to the
rodeo arena. Its position 1,100 feet (335 meters) above sea level
provides spectacular vistas of the far-off ocean.

<TEXT>
	   HUALAPAI INDIAN RESERVATION, Arizona (AP) _ Edgar Walema is
understandably nervous as he leads visitors right to the edge of
the Grand Canyon.
	   After all, it's nearly a mile (1.6 kilometers) straight down
from here to where the Colorado River winds its way to Lake Mead.
There's no guardrail, no warning signs, barely any evidence of
humanity at all. Just the smell of desert dust, the sound of a
gentle breeze and one of the most spectacular views in North
America.
	   ``We haven't lost anybody yet,'' says Walema, the vice-chairman
of the Hualapai tribe.
	   The 2,000-member tribe's million-acre (400,000-hectare)
reservation includes more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) of the
277-mile (446-mile) Grand Canyon.
	   Most tourists flock to the South Rim entrance at Grand Canyon
National Park, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) or so east of here.
There they'll see the canyon as well as a visitor center, museum, a
string of parking lots and, just outside the park, everything from
a Taco Bell to an IMAX theater.
	   Not so at Grand Canyon West, the Hualapai Indian tribe's small
tourist outpost on the western end of the canyon. The tribe offers
tourists a trip as close to the rim as they dare, accompanied by a
tribal member who talks about the history of the tribe and the
canyon and points out landmarks such as Eagle Point, a formation
which looks like a headless eagle, its wings spread.
	   ``The canyon is the beginning of our people,'' Walema explains.
``Like the Christians believe they came from Israel, our people,
the Hualapai people, our idea is that we were created here in the
canyon.
	   ``This is our stronghold. When the white man came and sent the
cavalry after us, the cavalry couldn't get back to us because we
were in the canyon.
	   ``Back in the 1800s, when we were rounded up and forced to
relocate to the deserts of California, a lot of our people perished
on our Trail of Tears. But a lot of people escaped and went right
back into the canyons.''
	   For tribal members such as Blake Watahomigie, the canyon is the
tribe's lifeblood again. After working construction jobs for
non-Indian companies on other reservations, Watahomigie returned to
the Hualapai reservation this year and now is a tour guide at Grand
Canyon West.
	   ``Now I'm employed on the reservation and I'm happy,'' says
Watahomigie, 28. ``It's so great to be out here. It's so beautiful.
People are just amazed.''
	   Lunch, believe it or not, is a highlight of the Grand Canyon
West trip for many visitors. The tribe serves a barbecue buffet on
a promontory jutting into the canyon, and visitors eat on picnic
tables surrounded on three sides by the canyon.
	   The canyon is so vast _ more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) across
at this point _ that it seems to swallow most noises. The subtle
shadings of red, pink and tan of the rugged canyon walls seem to
form pictures; here a thunderbird, there a human face.
	   After lunch, tourists can stroll to the end of
unfortunately-named Guano Point, where a steel tower is about all
that remains from a a bat guano mining operation that has been
closed for decades.
	   Getting to Grand Canyon West also can be an adventure. The road
from the nearest highway is called ``unimproved,'' which is a
polite way of saying kiss your shocks good-bye.
	   While dodging fist-sized rocks and jolting over washboard
gravel, those who brave the road will see a forest of eerie-looking
Joshua trees and the towering formations of the Grand Wash Cliffs.
	   The tribe charges tourists who reach Grand Canyon West by car _
dlrs 22 each for the guided tour of the rim or dlrs 27.50 for the
tour plus lunch.
	   A more convenient way to Grand Canyon West is by air. Air tours
from Las Vegas, both by airplane and helicopter, regularly land at
the tribe's paved airstrip. Tour packages from Las Vegas start at
about dlrs 110 and range all the way up to a dlrs 360 extravaganza
including a champagne picnic at the bottom of the canyon.
	   Helicopter tours which take riders to the bottom of the canyon
cost dlrs 89 from the Grand Canyon West terminal. The reservation
is the only part of the canyon where choppers are allowed to fly
below the rim, and the helicopter tours take visitors to areas
inaccessible except by river raft.

	   GREAT FALLS PARK, Virginia (AP) _ Kayakers don't need to go to
the Rocky Mountains to find the noisy, frothy water and jagged
rocks of whitewater rapids. One of the best is Great Falls on the
Potomac River, just 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Washington D.C.
	   ``It's probably the most popular place on the East Coast for
kayaking,'' says Luke Hopkins, a 20-year-old Arlington man who has
been running the Great Falls for four years. ``You can progress
from beginner to best in the world here.''
	   Great Falls, a solid barrier to river commerce west of
Washington, has some of the most difficult rapids in the world.
Mather Gorge, just below it, has a gentler series of rapids.
	   Both are popular with kayakers who can be in the water 30
minutes after leaving a desk job in Washington.
	   ``About 2,000 local boaters get out there on a regular basis,''
says Jason Robertson, access director for American Whitewater, a
nonprofit association in Silver Spring, Md.
	   Only about 100 run the falls regularly because of the skill
needed, adds Robertson, who has done the trick himself more than
200 times.
	   ``It's a blast,'' he says.
	   American Whitewater rates Great Falls just below the most
extreme level of difficulty. Its rapids are long, violent and
complex. Swimming is dangerous and rescue is difficult even for
experts.
	   Higher water levels can make the falls even more difficult. The
ideal depth is between 2 1-2 feet and 4 feet (80 centimeters and
1.2 meters), but it has been run up to 9 feet (3 meters) deep,
Robertson says.
	   ``My personal cutoff is 3.8 feet (about 1.2 meters),'' he says.
	   Hopkins, a champion freestyle kayaker, says he has run the falls
as many as five times in a day.
	   Depending on how often he pauses in the tiny eddies that pool
around the rocks, he can shoot through in less than a minute or
linger as long as he wants. The problem with dawdling, he says, is
that the gaggle of tourists always on the banks may think he is in
trouble.
	   To Hopkins, rapid-running is the safe part. It's the tourists
who walk on slippery rocks right up to the edge of the falls who
are taking their lives in their hands.
	   ``Those people aren't taking precautions. They don't know what
can happen,'' Hopkins says. ``I've gotten more hurt walking around
on rocks than anything else.''
	   Kayakers wear helmets and life preservers and are covered to
their waist by a tough-skinned boat. They also understand how to go
with the flow of the water if they get in trouble.
	   As a result, no kayaker has died at Great Falls in the 20-odd
years they have been running it, although one recently broke his
arm. The most recent tourist to drown slipped off the rocks in
1995, says Gary Pollock, site manager for the National Park
Service.

Jordan's Queen promoting Holy Land tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan is gearing up in a big way for
tourists, identifying some 50 biblical sites it plans to promote
over the next two years.
	   To kick off the campaign, Queen Noor delivered the keynote
address at the American Society of Travel Agents convention in Los
Angeles on Oct. 16.
	   The place where Jesus Christ is thought to have been baptized by
John the Baptist is expected to be open to the public by the middle
of next year, according to Jordan's minister of tourism and
antiquities, Akel Biltaji.
	   The site at Bethany, on the east bank of the Jordan River, is
being excavated around the clock to be ready for the opening,
Biltaji says.
	   Other Biblical points of interest include Moses' burial site at
Mount Nebo, the area where Jesus is believed to have retreated for
40 days after his baptism, and Madaba, home to a Byzantine mosaic
map of the Holy Land.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Florida exhibit focuses on the mysteries of ancient Peru
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ The largest exhibition of
Peruvian artifacts ever displayed in the United States will open
Oct. 23 at the Florida International Museum in St. Petersburg.
	   ``Empires of Mystery: The Incas, the Andes and Lost
Civilizations'' spans several thousand years of history, including
the rituals, artistry, warfare and daily lifestyle of some of the
most complex and sophisticated civilizations ever known in the
Western Hemisphere.
	   Among the 300 artifacts to be displayed are three mummies,
including the 1,500-year-old mummy of a sorceress, wrapped in her
hair, which is eight feet long. The exhibit also includes gold
ceremonial objects, ornate nose rings, and 1,500-year-old human
skulls with evidence of successful brain surgery.
	   The Incas, a nation of only 40,000, conquered 10 million
subjects to form an empire larger than the Ottoman Empire at its
peak. In Peru, mummification was practiced 1,000 years before the
Egyptians. Successful brain surgery was performed by the Paracas
culture more than 1,500 years ago.

 &UR; Air Canada plans New Orleans-Toronto nonstop route
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Air Canada will make one nonstop flight a day
between New Orleans and Toronto beginning Oct. 26.
	   The airline took up the offer of reduced landing fees the city
held out as a carrot to attract new carriers and destinations.
	   New Orleans tourism officials had complained that a shortage of
nonstop service was hurting convention business.

 &UR; An exhibit of Hemingway memorabilia is touring Spain
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A movable feast of Ernest Hemingway manuscripts,
photos and videos is touring Spain to celebrate the American
author's 100th birthday anniversary next year.
	   Hemingway, whose novels set in Spain include ``For Whom the
Bells Toll'' and ``Death in the Afternoon,'' made the yearly
running of the bulls in Pamplona famous around the world.
	   The traveling exhibition began in Madrid and is in Torrevieja
through Oct. 31, according to the Tourist Office of Spain in New
York. Other stops: Valladolid, Nov. 4-Dec. 5; Girona, Jan. 15-Feb.
15; Cordoba, Feb. 18-March 15; Malaga, May 26-June 28; and
Pamplona, July 1-31.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose sharply Friday, with the Dow
industrials adding more than 100 points to a 330-point rally
sparked by Thursday's surprise interest rate cut at the Federal
Reserve. The Dow Jones industrial average, which only last week was
flirting with its summertime low of 7,400, rose 117.40 points _ or
by 1.41 percent _ at 8,416.76. While still about 900 points below
the July 17 record of 9,337.97, the Dow is suddenly posting a
respectable gain of 500 points, or 6.4 percent, for the year.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Inflation disappeared in September thanks to
falling prices for gasoline, clothing and vegetables. The
seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index was unchanged, following
five small increases from April through August, the Labor
Department said Friday. That brought the inflation rate for the
first nine months of the year to just 1.4 percent _ even better
than the 11-year low of 1.7 percent recorded for all of 1997.
(US-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The world's club of industrialized nations will go
ahead with a new round of investment liberalization talks next week
despite France's pullout, the OECD said Friday. The Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development said the meeting at its
headquarters Tuesday will be to discuss ``possible approaches for
future action'' toward hammering out the Multilateral Agreement on
Investment, or MAI. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced
Wednesday that France would skip the meeting. Paris has objected to
dropping its barriers to foreign investment in cultural and
audiovisual sectors it says are already heavily influenced by
America. (OECD-TRADE TALKS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moving to repair Japan's teetering financial
system, Parliament on Friday approved laws to pump up to 60
trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public funds into the country's
cash-strapped banks. ``I have done my utmost to bring about
stability in the nation's financial system and regain trust both at
home and abroad,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told reporters after
the upper house passed the bills. The more powerful lower house
passed them Tuesday. Japan has been under intense pressure from
Washington and other nations to take quick action to tackle its
massive bad-loans problem, estimated at up to dlrs 1 trillion, left
over from the excessive lending of the 1980s. The credit crunch
brought on by the banks' tight hold on capital has been a major
factor behind Japan's recession _ the worst since the end of World
War II. (JAPAN-BANK BILLS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Reversing a pre-election position that
Germany's economic growth this year would hit the government's
target of 3 percent, outgoing German finance minister Theo Waigel
Friday acknowledged growth will be lower. Waigel said the
International Monetary Fund's assessment for 1998 of 2.6 percent
growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, was ``close to the
government's line.'' Shortly before Germany's Sept. 27 elections,
which his governing conservative coalition lost to the Social
Democratic Party, Waigel had surprised economists by declaring
growth for the year was on track despite increasing economic
difficulties around the world. (GERMANY-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may suffer shortages of meat, vegetable oil
and butter _ key staples in most Russians' diets _ starting in
January, a private agriculture group says. Since the economic
crisis hit in mid-August, plenty of food has remained on the
shelves, and the government does not expect any shortages. But a
sharp drop in food imports and an unusually low grain harvest have
prompted serious concerns. Russia's Institute for Agrarian Market
Trends, a private group headed by former Agriculture Minister
Viktor Khlystun, predicts shortages by the beginning of next year,
the Interfax news agency reported Friday. The institute said
imports were down dramatically, and it was not clear whether
Russian producers could fill the gap. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Intel Corp., the largest maker of computer
microprocessor chips, is paying dlrs 500 million for a 6 percent
stake in Micron Technology Inc., a big maker of memory chips. The
cash investment _ Intel's largest equity stake in an outside
company _ gives a needed infusion to Micron, which is struggling
against mounting losses stemming from sharply depressed prices of
chips that store a computer's programs and data. The stake
disclosed Friday is part of Intel's strategy of encouraging
development of new technology that will fuel from demand for its
silicon microprocessors, which supply the brainpower for more than
85 percent of the world's personal computers. (US-CANADA-BUSINESS

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A convoy of 144 Serbian army
vehicles, including tanks and artillery trucks, appeared to be
heading out of embattled Kosovo province on Friday night, only
hours after NATO extended a deadline for Yugoslavia to comply with
a peace deal. The convoy would be the first major withdrawal since
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
reached an agreement Tuesday intended to prevent NATO forces from
attacking Serbian military targets in Kosovo. An Associated Press
Television News crew saw the convoy on a major road heading east
toward the provincial border with Serbia. Seventeen of the vehicles
split from the main convoy and traveled north through Pristina, the
capital. Under the agreement, the Serbian army must reduce its
forces in Kosovo to levels from before the start of a crackdown on
Kosovo separatists in February. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ John Hume and David Trimble,
joint winners of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, have traveled
dramatically different roads as brokers of the historic Northern
Ireland accord. For Hume, 61, the single-minded peacemaker who
leads the province's major Catholic party, Friday's honor from the
Norwegian Nobel Committee capped a remarkable career that
culminated in an agreement he envisioned decades ago. For Trimble,
54, embattled chief of the Protestant party pivotal to the
peacemaking efforts, the Nobel was more controversial _
particularly considering the omission of his nemesis, Gerry Adams,
leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party. (NOBEL-PEACE)
	   QUEENSTOWN, Maryland (AP) _ The pace of negotiations on a West
Bank accord picked up steam Friday even though President Bill
Clinton, the host, dropped out of the talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Four mixed committees, including one that deals with the critical
issue of security, convened. Arafat joined Netanyahu at lunch, with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright due to join them. Clinton,
meanwhile, kept a commitment to campaign in Chicago for Democratic
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. En route to Chicago, Clinton talked by
phone with Albright for five minutes for what White House aides
called an update on the negotiations and an exchange of ideas.
(US-MIDEAST)
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's president asked ex-communist Massimo D'Alema
on Friday to try to form a new governing majority, giving him the
chance to become the country's first-ever premier to emerge from
the old Communist Party. If D'Alema succeeds, Italy would get its
farthest left-leaning government yet. Although he himself stands
with Italy's moderates on such matters as privatization and NATO,
to secure a majority he might have to offer Cabinet seats to the
Communists _ who oppose both. The leader of one Communist faction
said he was open to a D'Alema government, as did the leader of a
key centrist party. What the centrist party leader was signaling,
D'Alema declared, was that ``The Cold War is over in this
country.'' (ITALY-POLITICS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Taiwan's top negotiator with China declared on
Friday he was happy with a new beginning in relations, but warned
there was still a long way to go to build trust. After talks with
his mainland counterpart in Shanghai, China's chief commercial
city, Koo Chen-fu arrived in Beijing on Friday for two days of
sightseeing, banquets and a meeting with President Jiang Zemin.
That meeting on Sunday is not expected to yield more agreements,
but should highlight the warmer atmosphere between the two sides.
Koo welcomed the deal he and Wang Daohan, China's chief negotiator
on Taiwan, struck Thursday to work toward repairing negotiations
broken off by China three years ago. (CHINA-TAIWAN)

Baseball slugger among those honored by Cardinal O'Connor

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sammy Sosa was honored during a special mass at
St. Patrick's Cathedral on Friday, the start of a visit to New York
in which he is also to be the star of his own parade.
	   At the Spanish-language mass to celebrate the 20th anniversary
of the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, Cardinal John O'Connor
awarded the Medal of John Paul II to Sosa and four others who have
been active in the Roman Catholic Church.
	   Sosa hit 66 home runs for the Chicago Cubs this season and
captured the nation's imagination with St. Louis Cardinals first
baseman Mark McGwire in their race for the home run title. Both
shattered the U.S. major league home run mark of 61 that had stood
since 1961 with McGwire hitting 70.
	   Sosa, from San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic, was
especially popular in Dominican neighborhoods in New York City
where he is regarded as a hero.
	   A parade taking Sosa through the Canyon of Heroes in lower
Manhattan was scheduled for Saturday afternoon and he was to throw
out the ceremonial first pitch for Game 1 of the World Series at
Yankee Stadium on Saturday night.
	   Inside St. Patrick's on Friday, Sosa was given a standing
ovation by many of the 1,000 or so worshipers as he received the
medal for his sportsmanship and charity efforts. Several people
waved Dominican flags.
	   Sosa, dressed in a dark suit, gave his trademark gesture in
which he taps his heart, kisses his fingers and looks skyward in a
silent salute to honor his mother.
	   After awarding him the medal, the cardinal placed a red
skullcap, called a zuchetta, on Sosa's head. It was similar to one
worn by the cardinal.
	   ``Once you were a little Cub,'' the cardinal told the slugger,
``now you are a big Cardinal.''
	   In a brief speech, Sosa said that the idea that he _ who as a
7-year-old shined shoes and washed cars in the Dominican Republic
to help his family survive _ could be honored with a medal from the
cardinal was difficult to fathom.
	   ``I never thought there would be a day like this,'' he said in
Spanish. ``But it shows that if you keep going, you can accomplish
anything.''
	   Sosa, who still lives in the Dominican Republic, has bought
ambulances and founded a baseball academy near his hometown. After
Hurricane Georges ravished the island nation last month, he led
efforts to provide food and medical supplies to victims.

	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ John LeClair got his eighth career hat
trick, and Eric Lindros had a goal and two assists Friday night as
Philadelphia remained undefeated with a 5-2 victory over Tampa Bay.
	   Ron Hextall stopped 24 shots for his 231st victory for the
Flyers (3-0-0), moving him within one win of tying Bernie Parent
for first place on Philadelphia's career list.
	   Tampa Bay (0-3-1) is winless in its past 14 games dating back to
a 3-1 victory over the New York Rangers on March 30.
	   Wendel Clark had a first-period goal and Stephane Richer scored
with 55 seconds left for Tampa Bay.
 &UR; Capitals 2, Canadiens 2 &QC; 
	   In Washington, Scott Thorton scored with 2:32 remaining in the
third period as the Montreal Canadiens overcame a two-goal deficit
to tie the Washington Capitals.
	   Adam Oates and Dimitri Mironov scored their first goals of the
season for the Capitals (1-1-1), while Vincent Damphousse scored
the other goal for Montreal (2-0-1).
	   Thorton took a centering pass from left wing Patrick Poulin and
flicked a wrist shot over goalie Olag Kolzig's left shoulder to tie
it 2-2.
	   Washington needed only 17 shots to score two goals against
Canadiens goalie Jocelyn Thibault, who had given up just one goal
in 51 shots before Friday night's game.
 &UR; Devils 2, Rangers 1 &QC; 
	   In New York, Patrick Elias scored midway through the third
period and Martin Brodeur made 24 saves as New Jersey extended its
unbeaten streak against the New York Rangers to 10 games.
	   Elias' tiebreaking goal settled the battle of winless teams as
the Rangers lost their fourth straight at the start of a season for
the first time since 1959.
	   The Devils, who opened the season with two losses, avoided
losing three straight at the start of a season for the first time
in their history.
	   New Jersey, 6-0-4 against the Rangers in their last 10 meetings,
killed seven power plays and gave Robbie Ftorek his first victory
as Devils' coach.
 &UR; Panthers 2, Sabres 2 &QC; 
	   In Buffalo, New York, Rookie Oleg Kvasha scored his first NHL
goal as the Florida Panthers rallied to tie the Buffalo Sabres.
	   Ray Whitney also scored for the Panthers (2-0-1). Geoff

	   Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek made 32 saves, while Sean Burke
stopped 23 shots for Florida.

Japan braces for impact of Typhoon Zeb as the Philippines, Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
recover
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan braced for strong winds and heavy rain
Saturday as the deadly typhoon dubbed Zeb neared the country's
southernmost main island, causing the cancellation of dozens of
flights and regular ferry service.
	   The storm, which killed at least 74 people in the Philippines
and 18 in Taiwan, was about 170 kilometers (105 miles) southwest of
Yakushima Island, 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the main island
of Kyushu, as of 11:45 a.m. (0245 GMT), Japan's Meteorological
Agency said.
	   With maximum sustained winds of 108 kph (67 mph), Zeb was
expected to hit the coast of Kyushu early Saturday evening.
	   More than 70 domestic flights to and from southern Japan were
canceled and inter-island ferry service was suspended, national
broadcaster NHK said. Local train service on Kyushu was also
interrupted, it said.
	   Residents of Kagoshima city in Kyushu, 985 kilometers (616
miles) from Tokyo, were shown on Japanese television lowering
protective shutters over store fronts and lashing down plants
outside their homes.
	   Parts of southern Japan will be soaked by up to 400 millimeters
(16 inches) of rain through Sunday morning, with some areas getting
as much as 80 millimeters (3.2 inches) of rainfall in a one-hour
period, the meteorological agency said.
	   In the Philippines and Taiwan, disaster officials were searching
for those still missing and cleaning up from the damage wrought by
Zeb on Thursday and Friday.
	   The typhoon left at least 74 people dead in the Philippines,
mostly due to drownings and landslides. Ten people were missing.
The casualty figure is expected to rise because several mountain
villages in the northern Philippines remain isolated.
	   At least 103,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the
Philippines because of flooding. Most have since returned home, but
more than 10,000 people remained in 28 government shelters.
	   At least five provinces have been declared in a state of
calamity, to allow emergency funds to be released to these areas.
	   In Taiwan, 18 people were dead and up to 19 missing after Zeb
roared across the island Friday.
	   Torrential rains prompted mudslides that covered two houses in

Canadian network removes reporter from coverage of protest inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. has pulled one of
its reporters off a major story after revelations that he referred
to the government as ``the Forces of Darkness'' while giving e-mail
advice to a student protester.
	   The TV reporter, Terry Milewski, was the target of a complaint
lodged with the CBC on Friday by the office of Prime Minister Jean
Chretien.
	   Chretien's spokesman, Peter Donolo, alleged in a letter to the
CBC that Milewski was biased against the government in his coverage
of an inquiry into a police crackdown on protesters during an
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vancouver last
November.
	   ``It appears Milewski has set out from the beginning to side
with the complainants, that he has secretly conspired with a
complainant on legal strategies and that he has sought to portray
the government, in his own words, as `the Forces of Darkness,'''
Donolo wrote.
	   Milewski had been reporting for several weeks on the APEC
inquiry, which is examining how police handled the protesters and
whether Chretien's office was involved in security decisions to
pepper spray students and seize protest signs.
	   The students were protesting the presence of several
authoritarian Asian leaders, notably then-President Suharto of
Indonesia, who has since been deposed.
	   The CBC pulled Milewski off the story this week, saying the
disclosure of his e-mail messages to student protester Craig Jones
indicated the reporter had become ``part of the story.''
	   The messages, released at the inquiry hearings in Vancouver,
contained a list of questions Milewski had put to Chretien's office
and a suggestion that Jones might want to follow them up.
	   The CBC said it was investigating the matter.
