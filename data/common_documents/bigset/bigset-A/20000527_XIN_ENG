<HEADLINE> Karachi Stocks Collapse by 5.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KARACHI, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi stock market Friday
witnessed waves of panic selling and the key 100-share index shed
5.3 percent, or 93.09 points, to close at 1,510.45.
</P>
<P>
Out of 237 active scrips, 171 suffered losses while only 34
posted gains. A total of 226 million shares were traded as
compared with 184 million on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said Friday's severe blow to the market was in
reaction to Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf's speech on Thursday.
That speech, which focused on expanding the tax network and
documenting economic activities, has stirred those investors who
hide their wealth.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the fear that the market will further go down as
investors are pulling their money out of the capital market. At
one point, the market lost 110 points but later recovered to 1,510.

DAMASCUS -- Dozens of students from the Golan Heights studying
in the University of Damascus staged here on Friday a sit-in to
show solidarity with Syrian detainees held in the Israeli prisons.

The strike, which coincided with another by the families of the
detainees, was staged in front of premises of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
The strikers handed a written complaint to the ICRC office
director Claud Foila to be delivered to the Geneva-based ICRC's
Chairman. They appealed to the ICRC chief, Jakob Kellenberger, to
seek immediate release of the detainees and improve their living
conditions. (Syria-Students)

<P>

saying Friday that he decided to withdraw from the slate of
legislators elected to the sixth parliament on February 18 when
reformers allied to President Mohammad Khatami won an overwhelming
victory over the conservatives.

Rafsanjani had hinted that he would rather keep the post of
chairman of the powerful State Expediency Council (SEC).

Larsen said the problem of Shebaa Farms was aroused by absence
of an international border record in the United Nations, as Syria

Iraqi people and emphasized their support for all efforts aiming to
end their sufferings," the statement said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has agreed to go to
the negotiation table with Eritrea, but will only halt the
on-going war with its neighbor on certain conditions, said
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after talks between Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi and visiting Algerian President Abdulaziz
Bouteflika here on resolution of the current Ethio-Eritrean border
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said that Ethiopia had decided to attend the Algeria
proximity talks scheduled for May 29.

Ethiopia wants to make sure that the Eritrean army was no more
a threat to its sovereignty, he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Evacuate People from Cancer-Prone Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Health Minister Osman Durmus
said on Saturday the government is determined to evacuate people
from the houses built with cancer-causing minerals in Nevsehir
Province, central Turkey, reported Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that 380 people in Tuzkoy Town and 270 people in
Karain Village had been diagnosed "mesothelioma" which was caused
by a kind of zeolite group mineral in the rocks.
</P>
<P>
Mesothelioma is a tumor derived from mesothelial tissue. The
malignant tumors are often the result of excessive exposure to
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
People living in 190 houses in Tuzkoy and Karain should be
evacuated as soon as possible, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that after people are moved to other places, the
authorities will bury the ores with soil and then cover the soil
with a permanent flora.
</P>
<P>
Durmus promised that the government will do its best to transfer
the people living in these hamlets to some other places in six
months.
</P>
<P>
A total of 128 people in Tuzkoy and 133 in Karain have died of
lung cancer in the last 20 years, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization and Turkish Ministry of Health
have established that 98 percent of the deaths in Tuzkoy were due
to lung cancer. The region was declared by the government as an "
disaster area" in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Keep Fighting for Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- One hundred thousand people
reclaimed Saturday the return to Cuba of boy Elian Gonzalez, who
has been retained since last November in the United States after
surviving the wreckage of an operation of illegal traffic of
emigrants.
</P>
<P>
Cuban First Vice President Raul Castro, also ruling Cuban
Communist Party second secretary, attended the protest
demonstration, held in the fishing village of Caibarien, some 350
kilometers east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren, teachers and fishermen were among the speakers,
who concurred also in demanding the lifting of the blockade
imposed by the United States against the island more than 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzalez, six years old, was picked up from the ocean
near Florida and handed over to some far removed relatives who
live in the U.S. city of Miami, who refuse to return the boy to
his father Juan Miguel.
</P>
<P>
On April 22 U.S. federal agents rescued the boy in Miami and
delivered him in Washington to his father, who had traveled to the
United States accompanied by this new wife and his younger son.
</P>
<P>
The Miami relatives filed a political asylum request on behalf
of the boy which is being analyzed by the Atlanta Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Elian is still retained in Washington awaiting the court to
decide in the next days whether a six-year-old boy has the
capability to request political asylum, even against the will of
his father.

<HEADLINE> Colombian International Reserves Diminish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Analysts quoted Saturday by the "El Siglo" local newspaper
explained that this drop in the international reserves is related
to the fact that the market has been altered in the last two weeks
by the effect of the political crisis caused by the confrontation
of the government of Andres Pastrana and the liberal opposition.
</P>
<P>
That crisis paralyzed the study of the economic and budget
projects presented by the executive to the Congress, which are
part of the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) in the accord of December of 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Continues Between Ethiopia, Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting between the
troops of Ethiopia and Eritrea has been continuing in the central
and eastern border areas although both countries have professed to
resume proximity talks in Algiers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from Saturday afternoon, there has been fighting
between the troops of the two countries in the vicinity of Senafe,
some 135 kilometers south of Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, the
Ethiopian Government Spokesperson's Office said.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, a heavy exchange of artillery also
broke out between the two sides at the Bure front in northeastern
Ethiopia on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian troops captured the town of Senafe Friday night, two
days after they conquered the strategic neighboring town of
Zalambessa.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement issued by the Organization of African
Unity on Friday said that Eritrea had made commitment to withdraw
its troops from Bure.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Withdraw From Shebaa Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army pulled out
Saturday from one of its positions in the disputed Shebaa Farms
area on the foothill of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the forces gathered their equipment and munitions
in the position on a hill and pulled back to three or four
kilometers lower down.
</P>
<P>
The 250-square-kilometer farms are located on the Lebanese side
of Mount Hermon now under Israeli control. Israel says the farms
are part of the Golan Heights, which it seized from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war. But both Lebanon and Syria said the fertile
farms belong to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to a British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms was not included in
the Lebanon side. But Lebanon claimed the area was bequeathed to
Beirut in an agreement between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United Nations ruled that Israel does not have
to leave the farms, but reports by Israeli media said that Prime
Minister Ehud Barak had told French President Jacques Chirac that
he was considering withdrawing Israeli troops from the entire farms
to deprive Syria of any excuse to encourage the Hezbollah guerrilla
group to conduct military attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, currently on a visit to
Portugal, said Friday in Lisbon that Shebaa Farms is Lebanese
territory which can never be an issue of dispute or differences
between Lebanon and Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Syria and Lebanon are linked by a treaty of
fraternity, cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of Hezbollah guerrillas Hassan Nasrallah vowed
Friday to continue fighting against Israel if the Jewish state
failed to withdraw from Shebaa Farms and release Lebanese prisoners
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) completed its withdrawal from
south Lebanon Wednesday morning, ending its 22-year occupation of
the area.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of Israeli troops, the Iranian- and Syrian-backed
Hezbollah and other guerrilla groups have moved in, taking control
of the region as well as weapons and equipment abandoned by the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA), whose sudden collapse
earlier this week led to the hasty Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Middle East special envoy Terje Larsen said on Friday that
he hoped the Lebanese army will deploy in the area vacated by
Israel once the United Nations formally declared that Israel had
implemented the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls
for an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon in 1978 and set up a
security zone there in 1985 with a self-claimed aim of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since
then, the Hezbollah guerrillas have been spearheading a war to oust
the Israeli occupation forces and the SLA from the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian-Syrian Free Trade Zone Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amman, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million-dollar free trade zone
between Jordan and Syria was inaugurated Saturday at the northern
Mafraq district of Jordan to promote trade and economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration ceremony was co-chaired by Jordanian Minister
of Industry and Trade Mohammed Halayka and visiting Syrian Minister
of Economy and Trade Mohammed Emadi.
</P>
<P>
Halayka said the opening of the zone manifested the brotherly
economic cooperation and close historical ties between the two
countries, and the zone will also serve as a show case of Arab
economic cooperation to cope with challenges of economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The zone, located near the Jordanian-Syrian border, covers a
total area of 6,000 dunums (5.64 square kilometers), of which 2,000
dunums (1.88 square kilometers) have been developed and opened to
traders, investors and manufacturers from Jordan, Syria and other
countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Initial investments for the free trade zone stood at 60 million
Jordanian dinars (84 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new project was seen as a further step to improve ties
between Jordan and Syria, which had soured since Jordan and Israel
signed a peace treaty in 1994. Syria was opposed to any unilateral
peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Syria thawed after King Abdullah
Bin Hussein acceded to the Jordanian throne in February 1999 after
his father King Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan is one of the only two Arab countries,
alongside Egypt, which had signed a peace treaty with Israel.

SANAA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A Sudanese morgue assistant went on
trial Saturday on charges of abducting, raping and murdering of 16
women in Yemen, Yemeni News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Adam Omar, who was arrested on May 14, was brought into
the Bani al-Harith First Instance Court in Sanaa. And some 100
people attended the two-hour first hearing session on the case.
</P>
<P>
Omar, who worked at a morgue of Sanaa University's Medicine
Faculty, is alleged to have committed the crimes during the past
five years and eight of the victims were students from the same
university.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Omar confirmed his earlier confession that
he had killed 51 women aged between 20 and 30 in Kuwait, Jordan,
Lebanon, and Yemen since 1975.
</P>
<P>
In his confession read by the prosecution, Omar also said that
he strangled those women to death during raping them and chopped
them into pieces to easily get rid of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni investigators managed to identify only two bodies, one
Yemeni and an Iraqi whom he murdered in April and December 1999,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor demanded that Omar be put to death in public
before the trial adjourned until Monday.

PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A French navy warship arrived at the
port of Algiers on Saturday for a four-day visit to Algeria, which
is the first of its kind since 1989, reported Agence France-Presse
(AFP).
</P>
<P>
The vice-admiral of the French fleet and the commander of the
Mediterranean naval zone of the French navy, Paul Hubert, who
traveled on board the warhip, was received by the chief of general
staff of the Algerian armed forces, General Mohamed Lamari, said
AFP.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Hubert, Lamari expressed Algeria's hope
to carry out military cooperations with France in the process of
professionalizing the Algerian National People's Army.
</P>
<P>
The French navy ship, whose type was not identified in the AFP
report, will also call at an Algerian navy base in Mers El Kebir
near Oran.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Paris by Algerian Foreign Minister Youcef
Yousfi in January, Algerian and French officials discussed the
resumption of full military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
France suspended export of arms to Algeria in 1993, one year
after the Algerian government and Islamic militants began a civil
war which has killed 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
But France has kept some cooperative programs with the Algerian
army, especially in training officers in health and medical fields.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- England played to a 1-1 draw against
Brazil in a soccer friendly match at the Wembley Stadum here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil largely dominated the field but never outplayed the home
side who went ahead after 39 minutes when Liverpool's Michael Owen
scored with an angled right-foot shot into the far corner of the
net which gave Brazilian goalkeeper Dida no chance.
</P>
<P>
It was Owen's sixth international goal in his 19th England
appearance.
</P>
<P>
Brazil pulled level 10 seconds before the end of the first half
after winning a corner on the right. Rivaldo found Franca at the
far post and the Sao Paolo striker, the target for a number of top
European teams, found the narrowest of gaps between Gary Neville
and the post to make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Brazil were content to play possession football for most of the
second half in which goal chances were scarce for both teams.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Roberto Carlos went closest with a fiercely struck
long-range free-kick that was just wide of David Seaman's goal.

<HEADLINE> English FA Urges to Pass Emergency Law on Hooligan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The English Football Association
urged the government to pass emergency legislation to stop known
hooligans traveling to Euro 2000, according to the BBC reports on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The FA hoped new laws to be implemented which would allow
passports to be seized.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the UEFA Cup Final between Arsenal and
Galatasaray in Copenhagen was marred when fans fought running
battles in the streets.
</P>
<P>
That followed the murder of two Leeds fans in Istanbul before
the semi-final first leg.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there are increased fears that hooliganism
involving followers of England, Turkey and other nations will
erupt at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In a statement the FA said: "We are urging politicians of all
the major parties - even at this late stage - to consider
emergency legislation to withdraw passports from known hooligans.
</P>
<P>
"Such legislation was tabled but never enacted in Parliament
last year, despite Home Office support. At the time, we publicly
regretted the actions of those of whatever political persuasion
who opposed it."
</P>
<P>
The statement added:"Such legislation the FA has supported over
many years. We have had every reason to reaffirm that commitment
in recent weeks. England wants its contribution to be remembered
for what happens on the pitch, and for the performances of Kevin
Keegan's team. We share that wish with all but very few known
hooligans in our country."

<HEADLINE> Russia's Unity Movement Forms Strong Pro-Kremlin Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's second largest party Unity
Movement absorbed other five parties into a strong pro-Kremlin
party at its 2nd congress in Moscow on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the foundation forum
of the new right- centrist party, which was held at the State
Kremlin Palace.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Shoigu, leader of the Unity Movement and Emergency
Situation Minister, was elected chairman of the Unity Party by a
unanimous decision of the sides at the party's constituent
congress.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the congress elected Boris Gryzlov, leader
of the Unity Movement parliamentary faction, as chairman of the
Unity Party political council, Yevgeny Trofimov who is chairman of
the Our Home Is Russia executive committee, Sergey Popov, Nikolai
Loktionov and Yuri Medvedev as deputy chairmen of the political
council.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from the Unity Movement and its five allies: Our
Home Is Russia, All Russia, Party of Russian Unity and Concord,
Russian Socialist Party and People's Patriotic Party adopted the
new party's charter, a program statement on the party's goals and
objectives.
</P>
<P>
The Unity Party must become an influential political force and
political instrument of Russian society, whose interests will
determine the party's goals, strategy and tactics, says the
program statement.
</P>
<P>
The party "sees its support in the Russian people. Their needs,
aspirations and hopes are the reasons the party will pursue all of
its activity," it reads.
</P>
<P>
The party's main goal is "a great and free Russia for the
prosperity of the people," stresses the program.
</P>
<P>
To attain these ends, the Unity Party will hold constructive
cooperation with power bodies at all levels, active and
professional work in their structure and close interaction with
political, public and other forces and mass media outlets.
</P>
<P>
In the economics sphere, the party stands for turning the
economy into "an open one, but at the same time one that
reasonably and justifiably protects domestic producers and guards
the consumers from low-quality products," the statement says.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the congress, Putin told the delegates from
all 89 of Russia's regions, including the 18 delegates from the
Chechen republic, that with the foundation of the Unity party, the
reforms in the country obtain "a reliable political support."
</P>
<P>
The delegates of the congress also endorsed a monitoring
council of the party.
</P>
<P>
The Unity Movement, founded in last October, won almost 25
percent of the votes in the December 1999 parliamentary elections
and became the second party in the legislative following the
Communist Party.

<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of ten west African
 countries met in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Saturday to discuss
the situation in the war-torn Sierra Leone, according to a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from the Mediation and Security Council (MSC) of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) also
reviewed the status of Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), which breached a ceasefire reached with the
government in the Togolese capital Lome in last July.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Peace Agreement allowed the RUF to participate in the
government and the rebel movement thereafter transformed into a
political party to contest for future elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member MSC comprises Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia,
Guinea, Ghana, Senegal, Togo, Mali, Liberia and the host Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting is a follow-up of a similar meeting held in
Liberia early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone government led by President Tejan Kabbah is
battling to contain the renewed offensive of the RUF led by Foday
Sankoh, who is currently in government custody. Sankoh was
arrested on May 17 after his guards shot and killed some
demonstrators outside his Freetown residence on May 8 following
the abduction of the United Nations peacekeepers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- About 26 African leaders are expected
to arrive in Nigeria's capital Abuja to attend a silver jubilee
summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
on Sunday, the regional grouping announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the media in Abuja ahead of the forthcoming summit,
spokesperson Adriene Diop said the leaders, including 10 from
outside the sub-region, would later proceed to Sirte, Libya, for
another meeting on Tuesday regarding African integration as a
follow-up of a similar gathering in the north African country last
September.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, a 16-member group, was established on May 28, 1975
aiming to enhance bilateral cooperation and maintain peace and
stability in the sub- region.
</P>
<P>
According to Diop, the jubilee summit would address the
security situation in Sierra Leone, where the regional
organization is planning to send back its peace monitoring force,
known as ECOMOG, to revive the faltering Lome Peace Agreement
derailed by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by
Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, ECOMOG withdrew from Sierra Leone last
April to allow the United Nations peacekeeping troops, known as
UNAMSIL, to take charge and supervise the disarmament and
demobilization of some 45,000 rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
However, the RUF breached the peace plan by its renewed
hostilities and took hundreds of the U.N. peacekeepers as
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said the
community' s foreign ministers at a preparatory meeting on Friday
believed that "the situation in that country is still precarious".
</P>
<P>
The international community should assist in the
demobilization, de- mining and disarmament in the war-torn
country, he said.

On Thursday, Israeli Defense Ministry announced in a statement

for Regional Cooperation) ENT Congress here, the experts also
suggested more exchange programs to train ENT doctors for the
urgent need in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Experts called on ban on tobacco and alcoholic products,
because they cause cancer of the tongue, mouth and throat," said
Dr. Rakesh Shrivastav, professor of Otolaryngology at Nepali
Institute of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 scientific working papers were presented at the
conference, which was aimed at exchanging views among the
participants and informing about new technology on the prevention
and treatment of ENT diseases.
</P>
<P>
ENT diseases and hearing impairment are pervasive in SAARC
countries, with India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal being worst-
affected. SAARC also includes Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Due to economic constraint and lack of human resources
development, ENT services are not available to peripheral areas of
the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 500 experts from SAARC countries and some 100
doctors and specialists from other regions participated in the
four-day congress,which was co-organized by Society of
Otolaryngologists of Nepal and SAARC Otolaryngologists Association.
</P>
<P>
During the congress, some 20 medicine producing companies from
the SAARC countries exhibited their products and machinery for ENT
treatment.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the congress that the third SAARC ENT
Congress will be held in Pakistan in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Bank of Mozambique Suffers Another Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of Mozambique
(BCM), the country's largest bank, has suffered another serious
fraud, costing it some 2 billion meticals (about 130,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Saturday's daily "Noticias", the fraud occurred in
a branch of the bank in the northern Province of Nampula.
</P>
<P>
Four suspects who are all bank workers have been detained in
connection with the fraud case.
</P>
<P>
The paper claimed that the bank's losses could increase since
there are suspicions that more money could have been withdrawn
fraudulently. The Criminal Investigation Police (PIC) told the
paper that the money was withdrawn in stages. The fraud suspects
transferred the money into the accounts of some clients, and later
the bank workers concerned forged the signatures of these clients
to withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from this type of fraud, the bank workers used other
types of fraudulent operations which are being investigated by
banking experts since it is a complex matter. It is possible that
the amounts involved will increase", said a PIC source.
</P>
<P>
Other sources told the paper that the discovery was made when
one of the bank workers suspected of engineering the fraud
acquired within a short space of time three vehicles and three
houses.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, shortly before it was privatized, 144 billion meticals
(about 14 million U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of the time)
was stolen from the BCM.
</P>
<P>
The fraud involved a large number of dud cheques which were
treated as if there was real money backing them up. The worthless
cheques were deposited in the fraud suspects' accounts, and very
real money then flowed out of those accounts. The suspects were
named years ago, but the case has never come to court despite a
wealth of evidence.

Visa-seeking CITIC customers can now eliminate direct contact
with a consulate, and instead let CITIC deliver all completed visa
materials, including the visa application fee, to the consulate.
Visa approval or denial goes from the consulate to the bank, which
then contacts the customer.

Leading commercial banks such as the Agricultural Bank of China,
the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and
some small local banks are now engaged in a competition to provide

HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts at a symposium organized

health problems of women aged 50 and above, who accounts for about
14 percent of Hong Kong population.
</P>
<P>
This part of population will increase substantially in both
number and proportion with the postwar babies entering into mature
years, according to Professor Suzanne C Ho, chairperson of the
Symposium Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
There is an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk
factors such as diabetes, hypertension and increased level of
cholesterol among them, said Ho.
</P>
<P>
She suggests that women in mid-life should control their body
weight, increase physical activity and intake of fruit and
vegetables while keeping the intake of dietary fat below 30
percent of total caloric intake.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Urged to Enhance Intra-regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 27 (Xinhua) -- East Asian countries were urged
to further enhance intra-regional trade and tourism to step up the
region's economic recovery, a senior Thai banking official said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely essential for the governments of Asian
countries to understand and appreciate the new trend of regional
relationships," Olarn Chaipravat, director of the Thailand-based
Siam Commercial Bank, told an international conference here on
global economic transformation after the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The director also urged Asian countries, particularly those in
East Asia, to take advantage of the changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Since April 1999, the intraregional trade and tourism within
Asia have increased sharply -- so much so that if Asian countries
continue their existing expansionary fiscal and intra-regional
trade promotion policies, higher interest rates and a modest
slowdown in the U.S. economy will not derail the strong recovery
of Asia, the Siam director said.
</P>
<P>
International trade and financial positions of Asian countries
are much stronger and intra-regional dependency has deepened,
Olarn said.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 financial analysts and scholars from around the world
attended the two-day event, which was co-organized by faculties of
the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Beijing University.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's military court Saturday
wrapped up the 15th and the last court hearing for the 20 police
commanders and personnel charged with attacking students in a
Tehran University dormitory last July, with verdicts expected to be
issued soon.
</P>
<P>
In the session held at Branch Seven of Tehran's military court,
the attorney for the accused called on the court to acquit his
clients of the charges against them for lack of legal
justifications, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Those accused included former Tehran police commander Brigadier
General Farhad Nazari and Commander of the special unit of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Colonel Jamshid
Khodabakhshi.
</P>
<P>
All the suspects rejected the allegation that they were
responsible for the dorm incident, insisting that they had acted on
orders of superiors and in accordance with their legal duties.

Comoros and the National Company of Hydrocarbons of the UAE last
month, the first consignment of UAE oil products arrived in
Comoros this week.

Soefou said the change indicates "a new policy" adopted by the
new military power led by Colonel Azali Assoumani, which aims at "
increasing the competitiveness" of the Comoran Company of

He said that since 1996 Comoros has signed no exclusive
contract with Total, which was the country's sole provider of oil

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 senior citizens in a
western suburb of the Chinese capital gathered today to form a
volunteer squad of fire-spotters to curb the all-too-frequent
blazes that break out there.
</P>
<P>
According to the fire department nearby Yanhua Village, fires
have been on the rise since 1995; two fires have been reported in
the area this year.

And most of the fires were first sighted by retired people who
were at home.
</P>
<P>
The elderly volunteers will be on the alert for fires and help
spread general fire-prevention knowledge in their community.

Statistics for 1999 show that 673 people died in house fires
and property damage worth 110 million yuan (13 million U.S.
dollars) was reported.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Cooperation from New Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Saturday called on the new Majlis (parliament) to cooperate with
his government to root out problems in the country and improve the
ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at its inaugural session, Khatami said that cooperation
and coordination between the Majlis and his government would
prepare the ground for solving problems and pave the way for
gradual recovery of the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian society expects the Majlis, now under the
control of his reformist allies, to practice prudence and vigilance
and provide a calm and reliable atmosphere under which more
intellectuals will appear at the scene of administration.
</P>
<P>
All the people expect the sixth Majlis to assist the government
to implement the third five-year development plan (2000-2005), the
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis with a substantial reformist majority was
officially inaugurated on Saturday morning for a term of four
years, ending eight years of conservative dominance over the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The reformists won an overwhelming victory over the powerful
conservatives in the February 18 parliamentary elections and the
runoff on May 5, taking over two third of the 290 seats in the
Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis officially convened on schedule following serious
power struggles between the conservatives, who still dominate most
of the sensitive bodies like the armed forces, the judiciary and
the state radio and television, and the reformists, who now win
over popular support for a change in the society.
</P>
<P>
Khatami hoped the new Majlis would be able to strengthen legal
fundamentals of the administration to the extent that there remains
no room for imposition of personal and group preferences.
</P>
<P>
But observers here cautioned the new reformist parliament would
face serious challenges from the conservatives who control the
Guardians Council, an upper house, and the powerful State
Expediency Council, an arbitrative body headed by former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who disliked by reformist, quit his Majlis seat
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under Iranian law, all the bills passed by the parliament should
be approved by the Guardians Council before becoming laws, and the
State Expediency Council will have the final say in resolving
differences between the parliament and the Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis will resume its session on Tuesday to elect
members of the provisional presiding board. A permanent presiding
board including the Majlis speaker will be elected after the
credentials of two thirds of the members are completed.

house of the parliament, will consider the proposal of raising the
petrol excise duties in accordance with the tax law.

<HEADLINE> U.S. official Calls for Reduciton of Kashmir Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Under Secretary of
State Thomas Pickering Saturday said progress on the issue of
Kashmir could reduce tension and potential of war between India
and Pakistan but he did not expect early resumption of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes that reduction of violence in
Kashmir can help open dialogue between the two countries. Both
India and Pakistan have to contribute towards this end, Pickering
told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"We don't yet see a dialogue being started. We believe the
dialogue is important to calm the situation and increase a search
for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said Washington hoped for signs of an early reduction
of violence in Kashmir and "this is something that obviously both
Pakistan and India can find ways to contribute to. We hope this
will help" start dialogue between them.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said during his talks both in New Delhi and Islamabad,
he found a "remarkable conjunctions of views"between the
leadership on the two sides. They are committed to
find ways for a solution of their differences and reduce the
chances of a conflict, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging for me," he said. Pickering said he was
impressed by the urge on the two sides to seek a peaceful
settlement of their dispute.
</P>
<P>
The solution of the Kashmir dispute would contribute towards
the peace and stability in South Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is not a mediator but would only play a role
if asked by both India and Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. under secretary arrived here on Thursday and held a
meeting with Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf
on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
They said the total output of sugar of the country was some 2.5
million tons this season while the domestic consumption is around
2.8 to 2.9 million tons and thus sugar shortage could be estimated
at about 300,000 tons for this season.
</P>
<P>
The sugar has been imported from Thailand and China and the
booked consignment will arrive in July and September, they added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture
had said that Pakistan does not need sugar import for at least
three months as the country has the stock of over 780,000 tons of
sugar.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, importers need no permission from the government
to import sugar and meet local demand.
</P>
<P>
Although the gap between demand and supply is not so big,the
retail price of sugar had already shot up in the market by 4
rupees (8 U.S. cents) to 24 rupees (45 cents) per kilogram,said a

<HEADLINE> Myanmar CRPP Not to Give Up Sharing Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NLD overwhelmly won the government-sponsored 1990 general
election with 396 parliamentary seats or 82 percent out of 485,
participated by 93 political parties after the present military
government took over the power of state in September 1988 at the
height of the country's political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In its resolutions adopted on the occasion here Saturday of the
10th anniversary of the election, the CRPP demanded to the ruling
military government the emergence of the people's parliament in
accordance with the election result.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions denied any more future election in any form so
far as the 1990 general election result has not been materialized,
adding that it will also reject any state constitution drawn up by
the National Convention being in progress which is not
participated by true parliament reprseentatives.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions demanded that the government should abide by
the resolutions adopted on Myanmar by the United Nations General
Assembly as well as those by the international Labor Organization
and the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions also demanded the immediate release of all legal
parliament representatives as well as political prisoners held
since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions condemned the government acts of organizing
petitioning of "non-confidence" by eligible voters over NLD's
parliament representatives and demanding for dissolution of the
NLD.
</P>
<P>
The CRPP also said in its resolutions that it will not
recognize the laws, orders, decrees issued by the ruling State
Peace and Development Council (government) since the government
admits itself that it is not a legal government.
</P>
<P>
The CRPP was formed unilaterally by the NLD on September 16,
1998 after the NLD's demand to the government to call the people's
parliament elected in the 1990 general election within 60 days was
ignored.
</P>
<P>
The CRPP held a ceremony at the NLD Headquarters here Saturday
to mark the 10th anniversary of the 1990 general election,
attended by the party's leaders including chairman U Aung Shwe,
vice-chairman U Tin Oo, general secretary Aung San Suu Kyi and
party members as well as some foreign diplomats and journalists.

<HEADLINE> Disagreement Over Contest of Zambian Ruling Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment Minister Ben
Mwila's announcement to contest the leader of the ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) on Friday has evoked controversy
within the party.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the ruling party will certainly be presidential
candidate in the general elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who can no longer run for
presidency when his second and the last five-year term expires
late next year, indicated that he would ensure that Mwila does not
become the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba emphatically insisted that he would exercise his power
to choose a presidential candidate for the MMD, according to
Mwila.
</P>
<P>
The MMD said it is not time now to start the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail on Saturday quoted Information and Public
Chairman of the MMD Vernon Mwaanga as saying that the general
party membership want President Chiluba to have a say in who his
successor is.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his intention to run for the presidency, Mwila said
that there is no clause in the MMD constitution that gives any
person power to decide on who would run for what office.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga warned that Mwila could be expelled from the MMD after
he announced to contest the leader of the party.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Saturday quoted Mwaanga as saying that the
party will not hesitate to take harsh measures against party
officials and members "who think that they are above the party".
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers,
helped Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991
elections and now is seen as a leading candidate to replace
Chiluba in the next year's elections.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatists Friday launched
a full-scale counterattack on positions of Russian federal forces
throughout the republic of Chechnya, the Russian forces'
headquarters in the North Caucasus said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, the rebels have fired 14 times at the
federal positions near Avtury, Achkhoi-Martan, Nozhai-Yurt

the headquarters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are also active in using guerrilla tactics and
laying ambushes against federal troops, the headquarters added.
</P>

Federal border-guard posts and federal troops' patrols were
attacked for nine times. On Friday, a group of militants fired at
the Russian commandant's office in the Chechen town of Itum-Kale,
killing one federal serviceman and injuring another, said the
military.
</P>

The danger of terrorist acts remains in Grozny, Argun and
Gudermes, with 3,000-more rebels still staying in Chechnya, 1,000
of whom concentrated in the Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts and
over 500 guerrillas in the Argun gorge, the headquarters said.

mountainous areas in the Argun and Vedeno gorges and mountain
paths near the Chechen sector of the Russian-Georgian border, said
the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Two groups of 12 gangsters have been wiped out and another 22
suspects have been detained for involvement in rebel formations,

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Sulu Hostages' Fate Uncertain Despite Start of Formal Negotiation (Part 1)  by Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Hopes for the safe release of the 21
hostages in a month-long captivity remain dim although Manila and
the Abu Sayyaf kicked off their formal negotiation over the crisis
Saturday in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the uncertainty in the negotiation mainly lies in
the proposed Abu Sayyaf political agenda, which is reportedly
dominated by their demand for the creation of an independent
Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
Manila has repeatedly refused to consider the rebel group's
separatist politics, which the government said will destroy the
nation's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, abducted by the Abu Sayyaf from Malaysia's
Sipadan resort on April 23 and then moved to the southern
Philippine island of Sulu, include nine Malaysians, three Germans,
two French, two South Africans, two Finns, two Filipinos and one
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Government chief negotiator Robert Aventajado was reported to
be optimistic of the outcome of the negotiation, although he did
not disclose whether the Abu Sayyaf has cancelled its secessionist
demand.
</P>
<P>
"I think the conditions are right," said Aventajado before
leaving Thursday for the talks in Jolo. "Everyone is doing his
part to fulfill the order of President (Joseph) Estrada for the
hostages' safe release."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Aventajado said the top priority in the negotiation
would be the release of an ailing German woman hostage.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, however, was more cautious
about the final settlement of the hostage crisis, saying the
previous kidnappings by the Abu Sayyaf had lasted three to six
months.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages still "have a long wait ahead of them," Siazon
told three envoys of Germany, France and Finland who led an
European delegation to Manila Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports also said that in preliminary talks with Sulu
Governor Abdusakur Tan, the Abu Sayyaf was still seeking an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, where most of the nation's
four million Muslims live.
</P>
<P>
Having some 1,000 members, the Abu Sayyaf is a smaller but more
radical one of the two Muslim rebel groups in the south. It is
based in Sulu and Basilan provinces in Mindanao area.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which has held itself as the "alternative" for
Mindanao Muslims since its emergence in 1991, is often regarded as
a fundamentalist group because they choose to employ terrorism to
pursue their political ends.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine years, they were held responsible for some 70
terrorist incidents. This year alone, they have reportedly
conducted no less than five abductions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Sulu hostage crisis, the Abu Sayyaf kidnapped in
Basilan on March 20 more than 50 local Filipinos, mostly teachers
and school children.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the hostages have been freed following the
government troops' pursuit, the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas have killed
six and still keep seven in their hand.
</P>
<P>
The two major abductions pointedly coincided with the
escalating clashes between the government troops and another
Muslim rebel group-- the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF),
which shares common pursuit with the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Mindanao in the past few months have left some
200,000 civilians displaced, more than 100 soldiers killed and
nearly 500 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The upgraded violence and dragged-on hostage crisis are
believed to have helped float the Muslim rebels' political demand,
an ethnic issue that dates back to the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Police Asked to Uphold Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- In the face of an increasing
incidence of demonstrators' violence and lawlessness in the
Indonesian capital, Jakarta Military Command chief Maj. Gen.
Ryamizard Ryacudu Saturday called on police to uphold the law and
protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the police to uphold the law and protect human
rights, because if we permit lawlessness and violence in one place,
they can spread to other places," he was quoted by the Antara News
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Friday's rampage in central Jakarta in which five
military and police cars were torched by mobs, Ryacudu stressed
the maintenance of public order and security is now primarily the
responsibility of the police.
</P>
<P>
"When there is domestic trouble, it is the police in the first
place who have to come out and deal with it. Only if they can no
longer handle the situation or run short of personnel, will we,
the military, come in to help. We no longer live in the era where
the military always stood in the front-line," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ryacudu said his command is now working in close cooperation
with the police to maintain security in the national capital
amidst reports that part of its citizens were preparing to leave
the city.
</P>
<P>
"If people, particularly foreign investors, leave Jakarta (for
security reasons), chances are they will not come back. This will
be harmful to all of us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ryacudu said he believed the student protests of the past few
days near former president Soeharto's home in central Jakarta had
been orchestrated. During the street actions, the students clashed
with security personnel and they set ablaze one police and four
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"You can stage a protest, nobody can forbid you as long as it
does not harm or frighten the public," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey, Iran Mend Fences after Political Storm by Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A 140-strong Turkish trade delegation
led by Foreign Trade Undersecretary Kursat Tuzmen starts a week-
long visit to Iran on Saturday, signaling an end to the month-long
discord between the two neighbors over alleged Iranian involvement
in a murder case in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
An uproar erupted in Turkey earlier this month over reports of
alleged Iranian link to the assassination of veteran journalist
Ugur Mumcu in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Based on confessions of some arrested suspects, the Turkish
security authorities jumped to the conclusion that the link between
Iran and the Mumcu murder is "very clear." Some conservative media
comments went so far as to urge the authorities to suspend
political and economic ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The allegation coincided with the recent uncovering of a string
of appalling murders by Hezbollah, a radical Turkish Islamic
organization which is believed to have no link with the Iranian-
backed Lebanese guerrilla group that bears the same name.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Foreign Ministry has been cautious to avoid
making hasty statements.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Iran, two major powers in West
Asia, have been cool ever since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution that
brought the clerics to power. Turkey, a mostly Muslim-populated but
politically secular state, had been worried about previous Iranian
governments' policies of "exporting" the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has accused Tehran of sheltering rebels of the outlawed
separatist Kurdistan Workers Party and sponsoring Turkey's radical
Islamic groups, such as Hezbollah, which have been seeking to
overthrow the secular regime and install strict Islamic rule in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iran categorically denied the accusations. Tehran, for its part,
has frowned upon the growing ties between Turkey and Israel, Iran's
arch enemy. Some hardline Iranian media also suggested lowering
economic and political ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
While certain hardline elements in both countries were playing
up the crisis, the Turkish and Iranian governments have made great
efforts to try to solve the political woes through diplomatic
channel.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Iranian ambassador in Ankara, Mohammad
Lavassani, called at the Turkish Foreign Ministry and after that
both Turkish and Iranian diplomats made conciliatory gestures.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli
indicated that there are certain issues of sensitivity in Turkey
which it expects Iran to respect. Besides, he announced that the
Turkish trade delegation would go to Tehran as scheduled,
describing it as normal economic activity between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Denying that there was a crisis between the two neighbors, the
Iranian envoy said Iran is expecting a high-level representation
from Turkey at the summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization
of Central and West Asian Countries (ECO) to be held in Tehran on
June 5. Turkey and Iran, together with Pakistan, are the
founding members of the Tehran-based ECO, which was established in
1985 and now has 10 members and a total population of 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Lavassani underlined the importance of good relations between
Iran and Turkey, saying that exchange of visits between the two
countries has been continuing. An Iranian delegation visited Turkey
last week to discuss demarcation issues on the Turkish-Iranian
border, which he termed as a "very important and fundamental
visit."
</P>
<P>
Despite ups and downs in their political relations, it is,
without doubt, in Turkey's fundamental interests to pursue peaceful
coexistence with Iran, which is influential in the region.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Increase Imports from Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq hopes to enhance economic
relations with Syria and increase imports of Syrian products, Iraqi
Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah said on Saturday during his
meeting with a visiting Syrian delegation.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Salah and Dawod Haidar, head of the Syrian
delegation and director of the Oil Marketing Bureau subordinate to
the Syrian Cabinet, discussed means of promoting bilateral economic
cooperation, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian oil, industry and trade delegation arrived in the
Iraqi capital Baghdad on Thursday for a seven-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Iraq hopes to increase import of Syrian products within the
framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program, launched in late 1996
to alleviate the humanitarian crisis of Iraqi people, a direct
result of the crippling decade-old U.N. sanctions, said Salah.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal with the U.N., Iraq has imported Syrian goods
worth over 300 million U.S. dollars, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi trade minister, who paid a visit to Syria weeks ago,
has announced that the volume of trade between Iraq and Syria is
expected to increase soon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has agreed to double its imports of Syria-produced
medicines to 1 million tons this year.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Abu Sayyaf Begin Formal Talks for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and Muslim
extremist group Abu Sayyaf started their formal negotiations
Saturday in the southern province of Sulu for the release of the
21 hostages held by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
This is the first round of formal negotiations between the two
sides since Abu Sayyaf members abducted the hostages five weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Sulu, the talks were held in Talipao
town after the two sides agreed to keep government troops five
miles away from the negotiation site.
</P>
<P>
Four rebel leaders and five members of the government team
attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado
rejected one of the rebel's demands -- the establishment of an
independent state in the Southern Philippines, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the two political demands -- an independent Islamic
state in the south and a commission that will investigate the
alleged maltreatment of Filipino Muslims in Sabah, the rebels are
reportedly also asking for concrete economic projects by the
government for Muslims in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages -- nine Malaysians, three Germans, two French
Nationals, two Finns, two South Africans, two Filipinos and a
Lebanese-- were abducted from the Malaysian resort of Sipadan off
Borneo and taken by speedboat to Jolo Island, Sulu Province on
April 23.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Opposition Marks Election Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The National League for Democracy (
NLD) a major Myanmar opposition party which won the 1990 multi-
party general election, held a ceremony at its headquarters here
Saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of the election.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was attended by the party leaders including
Chairman U Aung Shwe, Vice Chairman U Tin Oo, General-Secretary
Aung San Suu Kyi and party members as well as some foreigners
including ambassadors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
U Aung Shwe and Aung San Suu Kyi delivered addresses
respectively on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
U Tin Oo read out a European Union's (EU) statement on Myanmar'
s affairs sent by EU at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Regretting that 10 years after the 1990 multi-party general
election was held the results have not yet materialized, the EU
called on the Myanmar military government to hold dialogues with
the NLD to solve the present political crisis of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 general election, participated by 93 parties, the
NLD won 396, or 82 percent of the total 485 parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
In January 1993, the government started holding the National
Convention which it said was to draw up a new state constitution
and power will be transferred to the constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
Although the NLD walked out of the convention in November 1995,
the session of the convention continued until it was adjourned in
March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Beginning late 1997, the government and the NLD tried for
several times in vain to have their leaders meet formally, as the
government insisted on excluding Aung San Suu Kyi from the meeting,
while the NLD stuck to her inclusion.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, 1998, eight years after the 1990 general election,
the NLD demanded that the government call the parliament elected
in the election within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
After that, on September 16, 1998, the NLD unilaterally formed
the Committee Representing the People's Parliament (CRPP) Elected
in the 1990 General Election to strive for the convening of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to a government report, only 169 parliament
representatives-elect out of 485 remain valid as of now. The
others include those who resigned, died and disqualified or
canceled by the election commission. Of the 169 parliament
representatives-elect who remain valid, 110 are from the NLD.

<HEADLINE> Diver Claims Discovery of Plane of French World War II Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A professional diver in Marseille has
claimed the discovery of the wrecks of the military reconnaissance
plane of French writer Antoine Saint-Exupery, who died during
World War II, reported the daily Le Figaro Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper published a photo taken a few days ago by diver
Luc Vanrell, about 100 meters under the sea, in which he was
examining the wrecks of a plane.
</P>
<P>
Varnell, 41, refused to disclose the exact location of the site
where the wrecks of the plane were found in fear of drawing "a
rush of predators," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Historian and expert of old planes Philippe Castellano told Le
Figaro that the wrecks found by Varnell are definitely those of
Saint-Exupery's American-made J-type Lightning P38.
</P>
<P>
The death of Saint-Exupery, a wartime hero of France whose name
is inscribed in the Pantheon in Paris, has always remained a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
His plane disappeared on July 31, 1944, off the French coast of
Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Saint-Exupery could have suffered from a lack
of oxygen or a breakdown of the engine of the plane, or even could
have committed suicide because of disillusion caused by France's
defeat in the war.
</P>
<P>
According to German archives, no allied plane was shot down on
that day in the area where the plane disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Saint-Exupery is the author of many successful books, including
"Little Prince," "Pilot of War," "Land of Men" and "Night Flight."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Forces Bust Militant Opposition Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian forces have busted a team of
the armed opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO), killing
one of its members in an armed clash Friday, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place when the team members were attempting to
infiltrate into Iranian territory from their base in neighboring
Iraq, according to a senior military officer.
</P>
<P>
One of the team members was killed and the others were forces to
flee back to Iraq, the officer said, adding that a number of
weapons were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The MKO had once been a famous political-military organization
fighting against the former shah's regime in the 1970s. But it was
outlawed in 1981 and forced to flee to Iraq following sharp
differences with the clergy government brought to power by the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
From their bases in Iraq, it has been sending assassins and
agents into Iran to murder senior officials and launch bomb
attacks. Tehran called it a "terrorist group" and air raided their
bases inside Iraq in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, the bitter foes who fought a bloody war from
1980-88 claiming some 1 million lives on both sides, still host and
support each other's opposition groups in armed struggle.

CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held
talks on Saturday with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting were not immediately available. But
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdi al Qedra has said that Arafat

Sweden, between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have been holding back-channel talks

Al Qedra said Arafat would also keep Mubarak posted on the
present situation in the Palestinian territories in the light of
recurring Israeli attacks on the Palestinians.
</P>

Arafat's visit came as part of the constant coordination and
consultations between the two leaders in an effort to seek ways to
push forward the peace process, he added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Group Gets Aid to Overcome Its Financial Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government and
creditor banks of Hyundai Group have agreed to supply a financial
aid of 400 billion won (about 352 million U.S. dollars) to help it
overcome cash flow problems.
</P>
<P>
The creditor banks will supply 200 billion won (about 176
million dollars) in fresh loans while extending the maturity of
Hyundai bonds and debts worth 200 billion won due this and next
months.
</P>
<P>
In return for the emergency financial support, creditor banks
demand that Hyundai stage extensive self-help efforts and
personnel changes, including the resignation of Honorary Chairman
Chung Ju-yung from group management within this year.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's borrowing from domestic banks and financial
institutions amounted to 31.4 trillion won (about 3 billion
dollars) in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Korea Exchange Bank (KEB), Hyundai's main creditor bank, Friday
decided to provide an emergency loan of 100 billion won (about 88
million dollars) to the group's two affiliates -- Hyundai
Engineering and Construction and Hyundai Merchant Marine.
</P>
<P>
KEB President Kim Kyung-lim said credit banks have required
Hyundai Group to present a self-help program, including
improvement of governance structure, sales of affiliates, real
estate and securities.
</P>
<P>
The extension of financial assistance over Hyundai Merchant
Marine and Hyundai Engineering and Construction comes a month
after the business group was said to be in financial trouble due
to huge losses at Hyundai Investment Trust and Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
Following the KEB's decision Friday morning, the composite
stock index at the Seoul stock market plunged 42.87 points to 656.
66.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party described Hyundai
liquidity shortage as a temporary phenomenon, saying South Korea's
largest conglomerate will overcome the trouble.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Grand National Party, which agreed to
the injection of fund to the business group, demanded it undertake
speedy restructuring, including reconsideration of its projects in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government will further discuss the financial
trouble of Hyundai late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Hyundai's financial trouble must be addressed
successfully, otherwise it will threaten the South Korean economy,
causing another financial crisis like the one in late 1997 which
was caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of banks and
financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Hopeful to Meet Economic Growth Target of 2.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has set up an
 ambitious economic growth target of 2.5 percent this year,
according to the 2000 Economic Survey Report.
</P>
<P>
The survey report released here Friday said that the growth
target will be met this year if donors resume aid support
expected in the third quarter of the year, newspapers here
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Launching the report, Kenyan Planning Minister Gideon Ndambuki
said the expected recovery path will start slowly before the
targeted growth of 2 percent plus is realized.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook of economic performance is predicted on continued
 implementation of structural reforms, sound macro economic
policies, improved financial management and continued
rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Kenya's economic growth has downed year by
year. It declined from 4.8 percent in 1996 down to 2.3 percent in
1997, 1.8 percent in 1998 and 1.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the poor performance to various factors
 including the persistent drought across the country, poor
infrastructure, massive withdrawal of investors and high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo said he was
hopeful that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would approve a
new loan of 210 million U. S. dollars based on the findings by its
technical team which visited Kenya recently.
</P>
<P>
The survey report expects the current downward trend in economic
 performance would be spurred by the resumption of IMF lending.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean War Veterans Urged to Vacate Occupied Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- War veterans and villagers should
prepare to withdraw from white-owned farms they occupied, as the
government starts resettling people under the amended Land
Acquisition Act, Zimbabwean Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso
Dabengwa has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing about 40 delegates attending a meeting on
authenticity and integrity of African national heritage in
Masvingo in south Zimbabwe Friday, Dabengwa said since Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe had signed the new land law, the war
veterans should be prepared to move out and give way to an orderly
and peaceful resettlement process, the daily Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"War veterans should prepare to vacate the farms they are
occupying as soon as the government starts redistributing the land
to allow an orderly and peaceful resettlement process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new land law allowed the government to seize white-owned
farms without paying compensation and 841 such farms would be
acquired compulsorily for redistribution to landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters have occupied about 1,000 white
farms since February this year to demand for an equitable
ownership of land.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Should Take Steps to Improve Cross-Straits Relations: Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- China's official Xinhua News Agency
released a signed article today calling on the new Taiwan leader
to take steps to improve the relations between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the much-anticipated May 20 speech by the
new leader was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
The speech side-stepped the one-China principle, clarifying
only what Taiwan would not do but nothing about what it would do
to improve the cross-Straits relations, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The new leader promised that he would not declare "Taiwan
independence" nor push for "the constitutionalization of the two-
state remarks," nor "a referendum on reunification vs.
independence," and that the abolition of the "National
Reunification Council" or the "National Reunification Guidelines"
will not be an issue.
</P>
<P>
Clearly the actions of the new Taiwan leader represent
appeasement strategies rather than promises. His true aim is to "
satisfy the Taiwan people and the United States," the article says.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-Straits relations, the speech evaded the one-China
principle with vague references in an attempt to bypass the
mainland's appeals for improved cross-Straits relations and
political talks.
</P>
<P>
"For the Taiwan authorities, it is of much importance to do
something now" on the basis of "not doing certain things", the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the Taiwan authorities should open talks and
negotiations with the mainland on the basis of the one China
principle.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Should Take Steps to Improve Cross-Straits Relations: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, it should push forward the cross-Straits
economic cooperation, personnel and other exchanges, and the
direct links in trade, transportation and postal services between
the two sides of the Straits, the article says.
</P>
<P>
First, the two sides of the Straits should conduct negotiations
and reach an agreement, under the principle of one-China, on
formally ending hostilities between them, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities must commit to no further promotion of
the "two-state" remarks, and adhere to the consensus reached
between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (
ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation in 1992 that the
two sides will express in their own way that 'the two sides of the
Straits both adhere to the One-China principle.' If they do so,
the mainland would like to authorize the ARATS to contact and hold
dialogs with organizations or persons authorized by the Taiwan
side.
</P>
<P>
The article also acknowledges that the problems of the cross-
Straits relations that have existed for decades cannot be expected
to be solved with one speech.
</P>
<P>
However, it would be extremely dangerous to evade the issue
with word games, while lacking a sincere desire to settle the
issue, the courage to forsake "Taiwan independence", and the
determination to make a breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Should Take Steps to Improve Cross-Straits Relations: Article (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article points out that while claiming to be sincere, the
Taiwan leader said that Taiwan had bravely stood up. Though he
mentioned certain things that he would not do, he also set quite a
few preconditions for reunification.
</P>
<P>
And despite praising the "wisdom of the Chinese," he said that
he was "a son of Taiwan," ignoring the fact that he is a Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The article stresses that the cross-Straits relationship is not
a game, and one China is not something to be left to the future to
decide.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Taiwan should not be dragged on forever. Any
schemes to split the motherland will meet the strong opposition of
the entire Chinese nation, including the compatriots of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the new Taiwan leader will hold himself
responsible to the entire Chinese nation, to the international
community that wishes China's reunification and stability across
the Taiwan Straits, and to the history," the article says.
</P>
<P>
The development of the cross-Straits relations will continue to
prove that foreign forces are unreliable, that the will of the
people should not be underestimated, and the move toward
reunification will not be stopped by any outsiders, the article
concludes.

A survey has shown that as high as 90 percent of obese children
in north China's port city of Tianjin suffer from fatty liver
disease.
</P>
<P>
The survey on 1,200-plus obese children revealed that the blood

China to Formulate New Rules on Medical Accidents

After exhaustive consultation with experts concerned, the
Ministry of Health seems to have made up its mind to replace the
12-year-old medical-accident-handling rules with new rules
expected to be issued in October.

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights of
major news on health care and medical research in China over the
past week:
</P>
<P>
Overweight And Malnutrition: Coexisting Health Problems
</P>
<P>
Although general nutrition conditions of Chinese students have
greatly improved over the past decades, 34.7 percent of boys and
43.8 percent of girls still suffer from malnutrition in varying
degrees, and nearly 32.9 percent of boys and 38.8 percent of girls
are underweight.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more kids are eating a lot more unhealthy
food. Overweight and obesity among urban boys has surpassed 12
percent. Many of them have a high risk of suffering from cardio-
vascular diseases and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
More Chinese Become Overweight, Obesity
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 18 out of every 100 people in China are
overweight. The rate of obesity has reached 2.48 percent, which
means at least 30 million people older than 20 are overweight.
</P>
<P>
Overweight among people aged between 35-59 has even surpassed
50 percent, the average level in some developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Residents in north China, especially males in Beijing and
females in Shandong Province, run higher risk of having extra
weight than those in the south. Females and urban residents are
more likely to become fat than males and rural people.
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Cancer Element Produced
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have produced a kind of chemical element
through artificial synthesize which can fight tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the world the element has been produced
through artificial synthesize since foreign scientists discovered
the anti-cancer function of saponin, which is separated from a
South African plant.
</P>
<P>
China Issues Rule on JV Hospitals
</P>
<P>
China has renewed administrative measures governing Sino-
overseas joint-venture (JV) hospitals and clinics, hoping the
sector's sound development can provide people a wide range of
health care services.
</P>
<P>
According to a rule newly-published by ministries of health and
foreign trade and economic cooperation, overseas hospitals and
firms can launch joint ventures in China after they get permission
from the two ministries. Solely overseas-funded hospitals are
still not allowed in China.
</P>
<P>
 Vaccine against Pork Tapeworm Developed
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have successfully developed a new vaccine
that can efficiently prevent the spread of cysticercus cellulosae,
the pork tapeworm.
</P>
<P>
Pigs receiving one or two injections of the vaccine are
immunized from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Both humans and pigs are susceptible to pork tapeworm infection,
and the disease has been widely spread in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Strike Balance between Work, Family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
Saturday urged Singaporeans to strike a balance between work and
family and put more energies for strong and stable families.
</P>
<P>
"We simply have to deal with the challenges the increasing pace
and volume of work imposes on our personal and family lives," Goh
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must learn to strike a balance between work and family," he
told the Family Forum 2000 which opened Saturday to launch this
year's National Family Week with a theme of "Family. Play Your
Part."
</P>
<P>
Noting that many Singaporeans are running on a treadmill and
have become breathless trying to balance their responsibilities in
life, Goh said: "The solution cannot be to abandon family for work.
"
</P>
<P>
"The family is particularly important because it is our comfort
and our shelter through our ups and downs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Children bring richness and joy to our lives as parents," he
added, saying he and his wife are at a stage of their lives when
they are looking forward to having grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
Goh emphasized that strong and stable families contribute to
social harmony and a good family will nurture and inculcate
positive values in the children, who will grow up to be
responsible citizens.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that government and other institutions
including the private sector should play a helping hand to tilt
the balance towards the family by creating an environment that
makes it easier for Singaporeans to raise a family.
</P>
<P>
Noting there are some signs that the institution of the family
is weakening in his country, Goh said his concern is that the
balance between work and family is increasingly tilting away from
the family.
</P>
<P>
Citing some surveys, he drew attention to the fact that
singlehood rates, divorces and numbers of single parents are
rising in Singapore in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to these surveys, the proportion of singles aged 40-
44 increased from 7.3 percent in 1988 to 13.6 percent in 1999, and
divorce rates went up from one divorce out of 10 marriages in 1988
to one divorce out of four marriages in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 41 percent of Singapore youths accepted
premarital sex, more than half of them approved divorce on various
grounds, and single graduates showed that acquiring a car is more
important than marriage and parenthood.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Lead Blazers 2-1 With Close Road Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Portland Trail Blazers snatched
the homecourt advantage from Los Angeles Lakers with a road win in
Game 2 of the NBA Western Conference finals, but the Lakers
returned the favor Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal and point guard Kobe Bryant
combined for 51 points as the Lakers rallied past the Blazers 93-
91 in Game 3. Bryant also had a game-saving block in the closing
seconds as the Lakers took a 2-1 lead in the latest series and
reclaimed homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
Blazers center Arvydas Sabonis, with 11 points, complained that
he was fouled on his final drive, but replays showed a clean block.
</P>
<P>
Lakers' Ron Harper's 18-foot baseline jumper with 29.9 seconds
to play gave the Lakers the lead for good. Game 4 is scheduled
Sunday in Portland.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal scored 18 of his 26 points in the second half and
grabbed 12 rebounds, and Bryant scored 18 of his 25 in the first
half for the Lakers in the first close game of the series. But it
was the last two of Harper's 12 points that were the biggest.
</P>
<P>
Blazers all-star forward Rasheed Wallace, who kept playing
despite turning his left ankle in the third quarter, scored 19
points on 9-of-11 shooting for Portland. Point guard Damon
Stoudamire also had 19 after going scoreless in Game 2 for the
Blazers, who lost at home for the first time in six playoff games.
Blazers' Steve Smith scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
Blown out at home by 29 points in Game 2 last Monday night, the
Lakers fell behind 15-2 early Friday, were down by as many as 14
in the second quarter and trailed 55-45 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, 2-3 on the road in the playoffs, patiently
caught the Blazers with a 20-6 run in the third quarter, then took
control with a 9-0 spurt in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Through the first two quarters, O'Neal was largely ineffective
against the Blazers' double- and triple-team defense. Sabonis
outscored him 9-8 in the first half. But the MVP took over with a
13-point third quarter, scoring 10 in a 20-6 run that gave the
Lakers its first lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers headed to Portland on Thursday after a final workout
at their practice facility in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to be a great team, we have to bring our `A'
game, do everything right," O'Neal said before tonight's game. "We
just have to play, we're capable of doing that. We just have to
get one of these two games or both of these games, take it to them.
"
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that winner of the Western Conference finals
will be almost curtain the NBA champions this year, no matter
which team comes out from the Eastern Conference finals.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Reformist Parliament Officially Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's 6th Majlis (parliament) with a
substantial majority of the reformists was officially inaugurated
on Saturday morning with a message from the paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony, broadcast on live by the state-run
television, started at 0830 hours local time (0400 GMT) with the
presence of President Mohammad Khatami, Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi and Chairman of the State Expediency
Council Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The reformist allies of President Khatami won an overwhelming
victory over the powerful conservatives in the February 18
parliamentary elections and the runoff on May 5, taking over two
thirds of the 290 seats in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the Majlis ended the conservative dominance
over the Iranian legislative body since 1992 when Khatami's allies
were ousted from the legislative body in the 4th parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis officially started work following serious power
struggles between the conservatives, who still dominate most of the
sensitive body like the armed forces, the judiciary and the state-
run radio and television, and the reformists, main supporters of
Khatami's reform programs which started since his election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Unlike to accept the conservatives' humiliating defeat in
elections, the conservative-dominated Guardians Council delayed the
confirmation of the election results for three months and nullified
the polling in some constituencies, depriving at least nine
reformists of entering the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The council validated the election results for 28 of the 30
seats in Tehran constituency only a week before the formal
inauguration of the parliament after the leader Ayatollah Khamenei
ordered it to do so.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the former president, announced to quit his seat in
the parliament on Thursday, though the Guardians Council hoisted
his position to 20th from 30th in Tehran constituency by nullifying
some boxes.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, a centralist with close ties with the conservative,
was expected by the conservatives to take over the post of Majlis
speaker, which he held in the 1980s before becoming president in
1989.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that reformists' dominance over the
parliament will help Khatami push forward his reform programs, but
it can not remove all the challenge and obstacles set by the
powerful conservatives.

</P>
<P>
Howard was among 19 federal, state and territory political
leaders and indigenous leaders who accepted the documents at the
Corroborree 2000 meeting, a ceremony for the cause of
reconciliation between white and black Australia, in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Howard called on his audience to focus on what

</P>
<P>
"The common goal of achieving reconciliation is sincerely held

About 200 people turned their backs on Howard and yelled
demands for an apology from the white as he addressed a crowd of
almost 2,000 in Sydney's Opera House.
</P>
<P>
Howard continued his address without acknowledging the jeering.
</P>
<P>

praised Howard for reacting with dignity.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Development Benefits All: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Saturday Malaysia's development policies ensure that
all of its multi-racial citizens reap benefits from them.
</P>
<P>
The government's determination is to ensure that no one race is
marginalized from the mainstream of development, he told the
opening of the 54th general assembly of Malaysian Indian Congress
(MIC), one of the components of the ruling coalition Barisan
Nasional (BN) (National Front) led by Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Indian community, despite it being a minority
compared to the Bumiputera (aboriginals) and Chinese, is not put
to a disadvantage by the various national policies.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Indian community, accounting for about 10
percent of the country's 22 million population, in fact make up a
sizable number of the well-educated and professional group, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian community has attained encouraging economic
progress in the past decade in terms of better average household
income, reduced incidence of poverty, increased equity holdings in
companies and balanced manpower use.
</P>
<P>
Hoping the Indian community will no longer feel neglected and
marginalized from the other communities in the country, Mahathir
said: "Such negative views are only perceptions harped on by
elements who wish to see the country destabilized."
</P>
<P>
The Indian community continues to be instrumental in national
economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed appreciation for the Indian community's role
in preserving racial harmony and stability by displaying maturity
in community relations, and thanked MIC leaders and members for
the hard work in ensuring the BN's return to power with a bigger
majority in last November's general election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,494 delegates are attending the two-day MIC
assembly. The delegates will elect three vice-presidents among
seven candidates and 23 central working committee (CWC) members
among 35 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Works Minister S. Samy Vellu, MIC president and his deputy S.
Subramaniam have been returned unopposed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lucent Technologies to Buy Chromatis Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Lucent and Chromatis are close to an agreement, the
acquisition talks could still fall apart, said industry sources,
who believe Lucent may pay as much as 5.7 billion dollars in stock
for Chromatis in an effort to strengthen its product portfolio in
the red-hot optical networking market.
</P>
<P>
Chromatis makes optical equipment for cities or metropolitan
areas, which has been a weak spot in Lucent's product mix.
</P>
<P>
But other industry sources and analysts say the potential 5.7-
billion-dollar price tag may be high, since the metropolis product
is still undergoing trials with several carriers and will not be
commercially available until later this summer.
</P>
<P>
The high price of the potential acquisition underscores the
growing demand for optical networking products.
</P>
<P>
Lucent, which had some manufacturing constraints in the
beginning of the year, lags behind Nortel Networks Corp. in the
optical networking market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Lucent, Nortel and Cisco Systems Inc. have been battling to
supply telephone companies, Internet service providers and large
corporations with sophisticated equipment that can transmit
increasingly large volumes of voice and data traffic.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Chromatis would strengthen the world No. 1
telecommunications equipment maker's position in the future battle.
</P>
<P>
Lucent also plans to use the Supercomm industry trade show next
month as a venue to announce a major contract with a European
service provider, CNN quoted an unnamed Lucent executive as saying.
</P>
<P>
Additional details about the contract are not immediately
available.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Hopes to Eradicate Polio This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh hopes to eradicate
poliomyelitis from the country by the end of this year, ensuring
that every child below the age of five years is immunized against
the disease, The Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the seventh National Immunity Day will
begin on May 29. During this round each child between the ages of
one to five years will be fed a single Vitamin A capsule along
with administration of oral polio vaccine to children under the
age of five years.
</P>
<P>
The third round of the immunization campaign will be conducted
from October to December this year to ensure that all the children
are vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a viral disease,
caused by polio virus, which affects the human nervous system.
Some 12 percent of victims die and survivors are permanently
crippled. Children under the age of five are most vulnerable to
its attack.
</P>
<P>
Before 1995, approximately 2,300 children developed polio in
Bangladesh, while the number of clinically confirmed polio cases
was 324 last year. Of the 324 polio cases, 29 were laboratory-
confirmed with isolation of wild polio virus from stool specimens.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good news for us that no cases of wild polio virus
attacks have been found in the current year while only 29 wild
polio viruses were found in 1999," Dr. A.M. Zakir Hussain,
director of Primary Health Care and Diseases Control.
</P>
<P>
Hussain stressed that every citizen should take the
responsibility directly or indirectly to bring the target-age
children to polio vaccine centers for administration of the polio
vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Laos to Patrol Borders, Check Drug Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos will set up a
joint land and river patrol along their common borders to check
the flow of drugs, which threatens both countries' social well-
being and security, the Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised Friday in the Lao capital Vientiane during
a meeting between visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and
his Lao counterpart Sisavath Keobounephan.
</P>
<P>
According to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Panja Kesornthong, who
attended the meeting, both leaders took the drug issue seriously.
The Lao leader requested Thailand's cooperation in stemming the
flow of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Chuan has made the issue a priority in his three-day visit to
Laos, as flows of amphetamines into Thailand have occurred
recently despite tight security imposed in the north, where
transit routes exist between Thailand's border with Laos.
</P>
<P>
"I believe a serious commitment from the top will ensure that
work at the implementation level of checking and suppressing
trafficking operations will be efficient," said Panja, who
supervises Thailand's anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also renewed their cooperation on border
demarcation. They reaffirmed their commitment to complete the
process by the end of this year and by 2003 for the Mekong River.
About 64 percent of the 450-kilometer land border demarcation has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also witnessed the initialing of a long-stalled
memorandum of understanding on pricing and conditions for Thailand
's purchase of electricity from Laos' Nam Theune II dam. The
formal signing of the agreement is expected in December.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's 1997 financial crisis put a brake on plans to buy
power from the dam, but the economic recovery is expected to boost
power demand to 1,200 megawatts per year.
</P>
<P>
Chuan's visit, ending on Sunday, follows Sisavath's visit to
Bangkok in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 26 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona played his first
match in nearly three years in a testimonial game of his longtime
rival Lothar Matthaeus.
</P>
<P>
With Matthaeus starting the game for Germany, Maradona started
for Bayern and led the team onto the field of Munich's Olympic
stadium as the captain.
</P>
<P>
Crsten Jancker scored the opener in the 10th minutes for Bayern
Munich and 16 minutes later, Thomas Haessler found the net for
Germany. Matthaeus changed sides and played for Bayern in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
With less than 10 minutes remaining, Matthaeus left the field
to another standing ovation, accompanied by his two daughters.
</P>
<P>
The official farewell match, which featured Germany's national
team against Bayern Munich, Matthaeus' old team and the Bundesliga
champion, ended in a 1-1 draw.
</P>
<P>
Slightly slimmer but still overweight, the retired Argentine
captain Maradona didn't run much and wasn't much challenged, but
he still delighted the crowd with clever passing and some typical
touches.
</P>
<P>
He lasted nearly the entire first half-time and was given a
standing ovation by the 50,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Klinsmann, the retired German striker who played with
Matthaeus in Inter Milan and Bayern Munich, took part in the match.
Matthaeus also played in Klinsmann's farewell game last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Toshiba's partner in China, the
Legend Corporation, announced here Friday it will provide Toshiba
laptop owners free patch-up programs and technical support to
repair a potential floppy disk controller error.
</P>
<P>
Legend has set up a special task force to test the disk drive
error, but has not so far encountered data loss problems, "China
Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
However, if Legend confirms that customers have suffered losses
from the disk drive defect, it will do what it can to protect
their rights, including negotiating with Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a two-week war of words between
Toshiba and Chinese computer users who were angered by Toshiba's
slow response and inadequate explanations of the flaw.
</P>
<P>
The disk drive flaw in Toshiba's laptop computers could cause
data loss or corruption when the computer is running multiple
programs at the same time, a Toshiba spokesman admitted last week
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese users are now seeking compensation. But, Toshiba
said no compensation would be given to Chinese users because China
's consumer protection laws are not as stringent as in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Debate of Toshiba's refusal to compensate Chinese users is
heating up on the Internet and among people who work in
information technology.

tour along the ancient Silk Road in July to popularize scientific
knowledge.

industry and commerce as part of a program to reform the country's
scientific and technological research system.
</P>
<P>
-- The paper's overseas edition reports that one out of five
rural households in China has sent at least one labor to work in
urban districts. The move has alleviated employment in rural areas
and promotes the process of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
-- China has established a new company in the national capital
specializing in the development of solid fuel rocket carriers, as
part of its strategy to compete on the international market.

 China Daily
</P>

China will step up its afforestation efforts by dividing the
country into four regions, according to a senior Chinese forestry
official.
</P>
<P>
The first region covers more than 700 counties in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, and the upper and middle reaches of
the Yellow River, a region that has the most serious soil erosion
in China, said Zhou Shengxian, deputy-director of the State
Forestry Administration on May 25.
</P>
<P>
The second region includes over 400 counties in the arid and
sandy areas of northwestern, northern, and northeastern China. The
major task for the region is to protect natural forests and make
forests to prevent desertification.
</P>
<P>
He said that the third region covers the natural forests in
northeastern China and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region where
efforts will center on protecting natural forests and reduce
limber production.
</P>
<P>
The fourth region covers all areas outside the above three
regions, he said, adding that apart from afforestation, planting
trees for commercial purposes will also be an important task for
this region.
</P>
<P>
China has been experiencing increasing red tides off the
Chinese coast since the 1990s due to increasing pollution by
industrial waste water, according to an official report.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, a total of 200 red tides have been
registered and over the past three years there had been 45 major
red tides, causing 240 million U.S. dollars in direct economic
losses, the recently issued annual report by the State Oceanic
Administration of China says.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that about 20 to 30 red tides are expected
to occur this year in the coastal sea waters, compared with 19
last year.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on the results of China's largest survey
of 2.68 million sq. km of sea waters under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The Business Advisory Council (ABAC) under the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) held its second meeting of the year in
Beijing on May 26.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 representatives from 21 APEC members attended the
meeting, which will continue discussion on APEC's path in the face
of globalization, the theme of its first meeting in Thailand, and
discuss a range of topics including building a more reliable
financial system, enhancing technological development and
application, and increasing business facilities in the Asia-
Pacific region.
</P>

the violence in East Timor.

<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin met on May 21 in Beijing with
senior Chinese army officers attending a conference on the
political work at the military academies and universities.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission
(CMC), posed for pictures with the participants.
</P>
<P>
The conference was designed to carry out Jiang Zemin's series
of important instructions on the building of the military
academies and universities and to explore ways and means of
improving the political work at the academies and universities,
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has called on governments at
all levels to take proper care of the disabled and on society as a
whole to continue volunteering to help China's handicapped
citizens.
</P>
<P>
He made a call at a national meeting on May 21, the 10th
National Day for Aiding the Disabled, to commend model volunteers
for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier spoke highly of the volunteers for their
outstanding contributions in helping the disabled and promoting
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
China now has 60 million disabled people. They urgently need
help to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests and to
participate in all sectors of the society, Li said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, 42 advanced volunteering units and 67
individual volunteers were cited for their outstanding
contributions.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, carries an editorial
on May 22 calling for strengthening of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) in line with President Jiang Zemin's recent remarks
about Party building.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Great Guiding Principle for
Strengthening Party Building Comprehensively," says Jiang's
instructions that the CPC represents the advanced productivity,
the advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the people
in China have both immediate and long-term significance.
</P>
<P>
These "three representatives" reflect the nature of the Party
and socialism and have answered the question of how to build the
Party in the 21st century, the editorial says.

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major events in
China from May 20 to 26:
</P>
<P>
A computer festival officially concluded at universities across
the country on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The three-day festival was sponsored by the Ministry of
Education and the "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
Computer manufacturers and Internet Content Providers in China,
including the China Merchants Bank, the 8848.net and Zhaodaole.net,
have brought along their latest products.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.17 million people took examinations during May 20-
21 at more than 45,000 test centers around the country to become
professional accountants this year in China, according to the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest number of people to take such exams
since China began to hold qualifying examinations for professional
accountants in 1992.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11.45 million people have taken the examinations
over the past years and nearly 1.98 million won qualifications to
become junior and medium level professional accountants.
</P>
<P>
The "goodwill reconciliation" mentioned by the new leader of
the Taiwan authorities in his speech delivered on May 20 is short
of sincerity, says an official statement released in Beijing the
same day.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued on authorization jointly by the Taiwan
Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council,
points out that on the key issue of accepting the one China
principle, the new leader adopted an evasive and ambiguous
attitude.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, his 'goodwill reconciliation' lacks sincerity," the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
The one China principle is the basis for peaceful, steady
development of across-strait relations, the statement notes. "
Since the new leader of the Taiwan authorities expressed that he
would not go in for 'Taiwan independence', he should have attached
no condition to it. Still less should he have refuted the reality
that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China by saying
one China is something in 'future'."

<TEXT>
<P>
Experts agree that the evolution of the third-generation mobile
technology has moved in two directions, from GSM to Wide-CDMA and
from CDMA to CDMA2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that China has started following the research and
developments of the third-generation mobile network, and a special
team has been set up in the ministry to take charge of license
issuing and fluency using for the third generation.
</P>
<P>
Within the year, the team will make public the requirements for
the operation of the third-generation mobile network for open
assessment.
</P>
<P>
With China's market continuing to open, keen competition has
emerged in the telecom sector. But only China Unicom is entitled
to operate a wide range of businesses, from fixed phones and
mobile phones to data and paging. China Telecom is now engaged in
fixed phone operations, and China Mobile includes mobile telecom
services.

<HEADLINE> China Supports Unicom in Telecom Competition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official from the
Ministry of Information Industry said that the government will
continue to support the development of China Unicom to help it
become a formidable competitor in the telecom market.
</P>
<P>
"We will give China Unicom more preferential policies to help
it grow," said Zhang Chunjiang, vice-minister of the information
industry, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China Unicom is a new company on the market and
needs support. "Otherwise, it is difficult for it to grow up."
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is now allowed to provide telecom services at a
price 10 to 20 percent lower than that of its major competitors,
China Telecom and China Mobile. It is also exempted from providing
universal services in the country.
</P>
<P>
"But when effective competition really takes shape, or when
China Unicom and China Mobile have a similar market share, these
preferential measures will be abolished," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China Mobile, the country's largest mobile telecom operator,
currently boasts 90 percent of the mobile market share.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also noted that the best way to support China Unicom is
to let it grow and run the Code Division Multiple Address (CDMA)
network.
</P>
<P>
China has 1.25 billion people, which is a large potential
mobile phone market, he said, adding that the CDMA is one of the
two trends in the development of the third-generation mobile
telecom.

During a hearing on the issue Wednesday, Jackson broached the
possibility of a three-way breakup when he questioned the

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 26 (Xinhua) -- New York Knicks center Patrick
Ewing has been listed as day-to-day after taking an MRI on Friday
following a foot problem that sent him to the bench during Game 2
of the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
Ewing played just seven minutes in the Game 2 loss to the
Pacers that left the New York Knicks trailing 2-0 in their best-of-
seven series with a berth in the Finals at stake.
</P>
<P>
Last season, an Achilles injury suffered in Game 2 of the East
finals with the Pacers knocked Ewing out for the rest of the post-
season, including the NBA Finals, where the Knicks were beaten by
the San Antonio Spurs in five games.
</P>
<P>
Ewing is averaging 14.4 points and 9.5 rebounds in 12 playoff
games this year.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Court Dictates Preventive Imprisonment for Oviedo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paraguay on Thursday asked neighboring Brazil to arrest and
extradite fugitive coup leader Lino Oviedo. The Interpol office
in Brazil was informed by the Justice Ministry that the Federal
Supreme Court issued the decree on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Former general Oviedo is charged with the assassination of
Paraguayan Vice President Luis Maria Argana occurred in March of
1999. Paraguay's government also blamed Oviedo for another coup
attempt last week.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo's whereabouts have been unknown since he fled asylum in
Argentina at the end of last year, although he has told the media
he is hiding out in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The justice of Paraguay sent the extradition request to
Argentina, where allegedly he sought refuge. It is suspected that
the former general is now in the south of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Paraguay signed an agreement in August of 1980 that
permits to carry out with expedition an extradition process. Now
the most delicate part of the case is Oviedo's capture, which must
be put under preventive imprisonment in Brazil before he is
returned to his own country.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Opposition against May 28 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The main Peruvian political parties
and labor unions announced Saturday in a public statement that
they would mobilize peacefully against the May 28 elections.
</P>
<P>
The statement underscored that the political organizations that
are calling to this mobilization also signed a Governability
Agreement and accused the government of President Alberto Fujimori
of trying to perpetuate himself in power.
</P>
<P>
"The elections scheduled for this Sunday as part of an
electoral process, questioned by the international observers
because it is tainted with irregularities, lead to an scandalous
self-proclamation of Fujimori and paves the way for a national
confrontation bigger than the one existing now," said the document.
</P>
<P>
The signers of the Governability Accord back the work of the
Organization of American States (OAS) observers in this country,
which is presided over by former Guatemalan foreign minister
Eduardo Stein.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian political groups also stated their support to
opposition candidate Alejandro Toledo, who withdrew from the
electoral contest alleging that he will not validate fraudulent
elections.
</P>
<P>
More than 14 million Peruvians are expected to go to the polls
to elect the next Peruvian president for the 2000 to 2005 period,
to which incumbent President Alberto Fujimori presents himself as
the only candidate.

<HEADLINE> Britain On Track To Pullout From Sierra Leone by Mid-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Saturday that it was
on track to withdraw its troops from Sierra Leone by Mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said British troops will pullout
from that Western African nation as planned, dispite a plea from
Sierra Leone President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who appealed on Friday
for the British not to leave the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Hoon told BBC Radio that British government was "on track for
withdrawal in the middle of June."
</P>
<P>
"We have made it absolutely clear all along that the reason why
British forces are in Sierra Leone was in the first place to allow
the evacuation of British nationals and secondly to allow the
reinforcement by the United Nations of their contingent in the
country," Hoon said.
</P>
<P>
British troops were sent to Freetown, the capital city of
Sierra Leone, at a critical moment when the United Nations force
appeared on the verge of collapse and rebels were making fresh
advances.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Considers Free and Fair Second Round Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is clear that the international community has based its
views basically on the reports of the Organization of American
States (OAS) observers mission, which said that the election is
not either free or fair," said Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who was left as the only candidate after Toledo's
withdrawal from the second round of voting, alleging fraud, said
that these elections are free because there is no interference or
any other kind of pressure for the voting.
</P>
<P>
"The elections are also fair because there has been access for
all the candidates, for all the political groups to make their
proposals, and all the problems have been resolved, from the
technical deficiencies to the free access to the communications
media," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that Sunday's electoral is within the legal
framework of the Peruvian Constitution, administered by the
National Elections Jury (JNE), whose decisions are unappealable.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 million Peruvians will go Sunday to the polls to
elect the next Peruvian president for 2000-2005, and they will
have Fujimori as the sole candidate to vote for.
</P>
<P>
The Toledo-led political opposition has announced that this
Sunday in the middle of the electoral process, it will make
protests marches and demonstrations against what they call
Fujimori's electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
Toledo has announced that his political party will not
acknowledge the results of these elections.
