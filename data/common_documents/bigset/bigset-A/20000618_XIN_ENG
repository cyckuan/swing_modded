<HEADLINE> Romania Unhappy about Referee's Time-keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Coach Emerich Jenei of Romania
was unhappy about the extended injury time which allowed Portugal
to a 1-0 win in Arhnem, the Netherlands in Saturday's Euro 2000
group A match.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that we lost in the last second -- maybe
even after the last second. The referee showed four minutes but
play went on longer than that," Jenei was quoted as saying by a
report.
</P>
<P>
Fourth official Michel Piraux of Belgium indicated there were
four minutes of injury time at the end of the second half. But
UEFA statistics at the end of the match showed the goal was scored
five minutes and 42 seconds after the final whistle, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he planned to enter a complaint about French referee
Gilles Veissiere, he said. "No, I'm only concerned with our
mistakes. It was a Romanian mistake in defence."
</P>
<P>
Portuguese coach Humberto Coelho was unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
"We played on for a minute after the goal, but I think it's
finished when the referee says it's finished."
</P>
<P>
In a qualifying game for this competition in October 1998, the
boot was on the other foot when Romania, reduced to 10 men,
grabbed a 1-0 victory from Portugal in the dying seconds.

MANILA -- Five school children taken hostage by the extremist
Abu Sayyaf group were released Saturday morning to government
officials in the southern Philippines, a report of the ABS-CBN
television said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the hostages are heading toward a
still unidentified destination aboard two military choppers.
</P>
<P>
The five children were among some 50 people seized by the Abu
Sayyaf from two elementary schools in Basilan Province in March.
</P>
<P>
Some of the captives were released earlier by the extremist
group in exchange for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
After the failure of peaceful efforts to secure the release of
the remaining hostages, which included teachers and a Catholic
priest, the military launched an assault on the Abu Sayyaf's
jungle hideout in Mount Puno Mohadje in April.(Philippines-

NEW DELHI -- Heavily armed gunmen shot dead 34 members of the
Yadav community, including women and children, in a village in
Aurangabad district in East India's Bihar state Friday night,
police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second major massacre in Bihar state. Last weekend,
12 villagers were killed in Nawada district.
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 10 activists of the outlawed Ranvir Sena,
a private army of upper caste landlords, armed with self-loading
rifles and sharp-edged weapons, swooped on the hamlet of Miapur
and rained bullets on inmates after storming their houses as they
were prepared to go to sleep at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
All the 34 people were killed on the spot while 10 injured
persons have been admitted to the government hospital nearby for
treatment, according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
The killing appeared to be in retaliation to the massacre of 12
upper caste villagers in the neighboring Nawada district on the
intervening night of June 11-12.
</P>
<P>
A total of 52 people have been killed in three successive
massacres in Nawada and Aurangabad since this month. (India-

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Substitute Costinha's head goal
in the fourth minute of injury time gave Portugal a 1-0 victory
over Romania and sent it to the quarterfinals of Euro 2000 on
Saturday at the Gelredome stadium in eastern Dutch town.
</P>
<P>
The two teams, who both favour a patient, passing style,
cancelled each other out until the final seconds of a group A game
played out in midfield and lacking in goalmouth incident, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Costinha, who had been on the pitch only six minutes, beat the
Romanian defence to a Luis Figo free kick to head his first goal
for his country in only his third appearance.
</P>
<P>
The goal sent the tens of thousands of Portuguese fans
ecstatic and left the Romanians stunned and helpless.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good game. A game of patience, a very tactical game,
" said Portugal's coach Humberto Coelho. "Romania was a very hard
team to beat. It is a difficult team with very experienced players.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tactical game which required a lot of patience but I
think there was justice in the end. I think scoring in the last
minute of a tactical game was phenomenal so now we can look ahead,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
After thrilling the tournament with its dramatic defeat of
England, Portugal looked as if it would have to settle for a 0-0
draw.
</P>
<P>
Portugal set the European Championship alight Monday when Figo,
Rui Costa and Joao Pinto dazzled England to turn a 2-0 deficit
into a famous 3-2 win.
</P>
<P>
Romania drew 1-1 against Germany in its opener.
</P>
<P>
England and Germany played in Charleroi, Belgium, late on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In front of some 22,000 fans in the eastern Dutch town,
Portugal went forward from the start and in the fifth minute Nuno
Gomes sent a low drive wide of the goal while, three minute later,
defender Fernando Couto tried a blast from just outside the box.
</P>
<P>
But Portugal was not given half the room the English side had
allowed it in the opening match, with the Romanian defense and
midfield fighting fiercely for every ball and committing fouls
whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
By midway through the first half the game was giving signs
that it was going to be a long slog. By the 22nd minute, Romania
had three yellow cards including one for star player Hagi which
axes him from the side's final game against England.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's star Luis Figo, also got sanctioned in the 30th
minute for shirt pulling.
</P>
<P>
But while Figo could be seen one minute on the right, the next
on the left, back and then forward, Galatasaray's veteran Hagi
stayed on the right using minimum energy.
</P>
<P>
After 60 minutes he looked spent although coach Emerich Jenei
let him ride the full 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the 86th minute Hagi had the best chance for Romania,
forcing Vitor Baia into a superb save from a dipping 20-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
Veissiere signalled four minutes of injury time after a game
full of crunching tackles and in the dying moments Figo whipped a
free kick in from the left of the area and midfielder Costinha
headed home from six meters.

<HEADLINE> Iran Kills MKO Members Plotting Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards
Corps (IRGC) on Sunday killed two members of the Iraq-based
military opposition Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) near the
border with Iraq, the official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to IRGC command headquarters, the two had tried to
infiltrate into Iran for sabotage via the border town of Qasre-e
Shirin in the western Kermanshah Province. They were killed in
armed clashes with IRGC personnel, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The documents recovered from them indicated that they had
intended to bomb part of the city of Kermanshah, including the
headquarters of the provincial security force.
</P>
<P>
Large amount of ammunition, including hand grenades, and
communication sets, were seized from the infiltrators, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was a famous political-military group fighting against
the late Iranian shah's regime. It was outlawed in 1981 and fled to
Iraq following sharp differences with the clergy brought to power
in the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The group has since carried out numerous attacks against Iranian
targets both inside and outside Iran, causing casualties and
damage. Iran raided its bases in Iraq in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, who fought a bloody war from 1980-88, still host
each other's oppositions, which is a major obstacle to a
normalization of relations.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Urges to Combat Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
here Sunday urged for a campaign to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with senior military and security officials,
Saleh said the anti-corruption campaign is the task of the coming
period.
</P>
<P>
He identified as the main tasks combating corruption in public
institutions, curbing nepotism, and enhancing the rule of law, the
official SABA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also urged for stabilizing security situation in the society,
and toughening punishment against law-breakers, who harm the
country's security and tarnish its image through sabotage acts such
as kidnapping, robbery and other criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Yemen witnessed a series of kidnappings and robberies against
foreigners in the recent past. Its troops are still searching for
an Italian archaeologist, who was reportedly kidnapped by a tribal
group.
</P>
<P>
"The law-breakers should never be overlooked or tolerated," he
said. "Rather, they should be regarded as a bad example and
severely punished according to the laws and justice."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief in Cairo for Talks on Issues Related to Lebanon, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua ) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan arrived in Cairo Sunday on the second leg of a Middle
East trip mainly aimed at ensuring Lebanon shall remain calm
following Israel's withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival, Annan said there are some
problems over verification of Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and
definition of the border, but both sides have agreed to solve the
issues in cooperation with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed troop withdrawal from a border strip in
southern Lebanon on May 24, ending 22 years of occupation there.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Friday confirmed Israel had fully withdrawn from
southern Lebanon under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
But Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss disputed the confirmation,
insisting that Israel still occupies land in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan voiced confidence that the problems between Lebanon and
Israel will be solved soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed the importance of continuing the Mideast
peace process and expressed hope that the new Syrian leadership in
the making will work within the peace framework.
</P>
<P>
Following the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on June
10, the country's ruling Baath Party has been working to promote
Bashar, son of the late president, to the supreme position.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here after a visit to Iran. He will also travel to
Lebanon, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria and Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Hopes Cyprus Talks Not to Be Affected by Addendum Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official Sunday expressed
hope that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's displeasure over
the dropping of an addendum from a resolution renewing UNFICYP's
(U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus) mandate will not not affect the
peace talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General's Special Advisor for Cyprus Alvaro de
Soto Sunday afternoon ended his four-day visit to the island, which
was overshadowed by ambiguous remarks of the Turkish Cypriots
regarding their participation in the third round of U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks, due to start on July 5 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, de Soto stressed the process of the talks
may be interrupted only if the needs of the talks dictate so.
</P>
<P>
De Soto's visit to the island had been dogged by fury in the
north over the exclusion of the addendum to the renewal of the
UNFYCYP mandate, which would have given Turkish Cypriot permission
for the force's continued presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
The addendum was dropped on Wednesday after Cyprus' government
branded it as being tantamount to recognition of the Turkish
Cypriot regime and threatened to block the renewal unless it was
removed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resolution 186, which ordered the U.N. peacekeeping force
to Cyprus in March 1964, said the U.N. consults with the government
of the Republic of Cyprus for the maintenance of the force on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the U.N. move, Denktash has announced he could not
rule out withdrawing from the proximity talks.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the difficulties ahead, de Soto said "recent
developments have not necessarily improved the climate, " saying
Denktash told him he is considering his position in the light of
these developments.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there is a commitment by Denktash to go to Geneva, de
Soto replied, "I think Mr Denktash will be in Geneva, that is my
personal feeling."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus have been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two sides on the Mediterranean island have
held two rounds of proximity talks under U.N. auspices in an effort
to prepare the ground for substantive talks which may lead to a
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
De Soto left Sunday afternoon for Athens and Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Stresses EU Role in Mideast Peace Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Sunday called on the European Union (EU) to play an important
role in bridging differences between Israel and its Arab neighbors
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The monarch made the appeal when meeting with EU Middle East
peace envoy Mieguel Muratinos over the latest developments of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and on ways of achieving a just,
durable and comprehensive in the region, Jordan's official news
agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah described Israel's pullout from southern Lebanon in May
after over two decades of occupation as a "positive step" toward a
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria, a major power broker in
Lebanon, were deadlocked in January after the Jewish state rejected
a Syrian demand to give back in full the Golan Heights it captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
resumed the final status peace talks in Washington earlier this
month but have failed so far to make substantial progress on issues
such as the status of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees
to their homeland, border demarkation and water sharing
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Muratinos expressed his appreciation for Jordan's
role as a major peace broker in the Arab-Israeli peace talks, and
pledged that the EU will continue to work for peace and stability
in the region, Petra said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994 as one of
the only two Arab countries after Egypt to strike such a peace deal
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Muratinos also discussed cooperation between Jordan
and the 15-member EU, which provided some 100 million U.S. dollars
annually in various aid packages to the kingdom, the second largest
donor next to the United States.

<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>

to the Arab countries while imported only 28.8 million worth of
goods from them.

Ministry said the program intended to create jobs in tourism,
commerce, industry, and agriculture sectors needs financial
assistance of about 696 million dollars from the donor countries.

percent of the estimated 74,000 Palestinian jobless, the ministry
said in a paper submitted to the two-day Conference of the U.N.
Organizations which wrapped up in Gaza this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Group-15 countries

<P>
He said the G-15 wants a means of cooperation among developing

<HEADLINE> Moment of Truth for Palestinian Talks Approaches: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Sunday told his inner-circle security cabinet ministers that the
moment of truth for the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks is fast
approaching.
</P>
<P>
"We are reaching the end of a political corridor, which started
with the Oslo agreement, and the time has come for decisions to be
made," the prime minister said in a statement issued after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the talks with the Palestinians are dealing with the
core of conflicts between Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The subjects currently being discussed are complicated and
sensitive, the prime minister stated, adding how they will be
resolved will affect the lives for generations to come in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel is committed to reaching a settlement and is
ready to make difficult decisions while protecting its vital
interests, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also suggested the Palestinians are foot-dragging the
peace process, saying it is impossible to force an agreement
without the good will of the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
The security cabinet meeting, which Barak termed as "one of the
most important meetings since the government was formed" in last
July, lasted more than five hours and will continue in the near
future, maybe on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting on the Israeli-Palestinian talks was
convened at the request of variable coalition factions. Some of
them had been complaining that Barak keeps them in dark about what
is happening in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aiming to reach a framework agreement and a final
accord by September to resolve their disputes over so-called final-
status issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, the return of
Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, border, security and
water.
</P>
<P>
Barak asserted at Sunday's meeting that he prefers a
comprehensive framework agreement on the permanent settlement to a
partial agreement, which will leave some thorny issues to be ironed
out later.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of the talks between Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators has ended in Washington and the two delegations are
heading home on Sunday without making any tangible progress.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) general staff,
Military Intelligence and the Mossad Intelligence Agency Sunday
presented the security cabinet meeting with possible scenarios that
might arise with or without an Israeli-Palestinian framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence sources warned that if Israel does not reach a
deal with the Palestinians, there is a real risk of Palestinian
violence, even direct military confrontation between the IDF and
the Palestinian National Authority, according to Israel Radio
reports.
</P>
<P>
They argued Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will have nothing
to lose from such a confrontation, in case that there is no peace
agreement with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea signed here on
Sunday morning a cease-fire deal to end their two-year-long border
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and his Eritrean
counterpart Haile Woldetensae inked the accord at an official
ceremony attended by Algerian President and current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) AbdelAziz Bouteflika, OAU
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim, U.S Presidential envoy Antony
Like, EU envoy to the Horn of African Region Renault Seri and
foreign ambassadors accredited in Algiers, Algerian News Agency

Addressing the ceremony, Bouteflika praised the deal as "a
historical event" which crowned the efforts made to restore peace
and stability in the Horn of Africa region.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal calls for an immediate truce and the deployment
of a U.N peacekeeping force in a 25-kilometer buffer zone in
Eritrea until the border between the two countries is demarcated.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been engaged in a long standing border
dispute since May 6, l998 when the Eritrean troops invaded and
seized some Ethiopian territories under sovereignty claims.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting between the two neighbor countries since
May 12 this year inflicted huge casualties and property losses on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Indirect talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea proceeded here from
May 29 to June 10 under supervision of Algerian presidential envoy
on Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute Ahmed Oyehiya.
</P>
<P>
On June l4, Addis Ababa formally agreed on the draft deal
already accepted by Eritrea on June 9.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord will pave the way for launching negotiations on
implementing the framework agreement on the Ethiopian-Eritrean
border dispute drafted by the OAU during the OAU Summit meeting in
Algiers in July l999.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Ruling Baathist Party Continues National Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Syria's ruling Arab Socialist
Baathist Party (ASBP) continued its ninth national congress here
Sunday morning to hear the reports of the political, organizational
and economic committees.
</P>
<P>
The last national congress was held 15 years ago under late
secretary general of the ASBP and head of state Hafez al-Assad who
ruled Syria for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The current congress is expected to elect Bashar al-Assad new
ASBP secretary general, 90 new members of the Central Committee and
21 members of the National Leadership to express the desire of the
party to inject new blood to its leadership and introduce Syria to
the 21st century as a strong and skilled country.
</P>
<P>
The tendency to inject new blood to the party leadership does
not necessarily mean the sacrifice of the experienced old-aged
members, according to Syrian sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources expect that the national leadership will include a
number of people who enjoy Bashar's trust such as Prime Minister
Mohammed Mustafa Miro, Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, Commander of
the Syrian forces in Lebanon General Ebrahim al-Safi, and Deputy
Chief of General Staff General Abdul-Rahman al-Saiyad.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Defense Mohammed Mustafa Tallas, vice president of
the country and ASBP assistant secretary general Abdul Halim
Khaddam, and ASBP assistant general secretaries Suleiman Kaddah and
Abdullah Lahmar will retain their positions in the new national
leadership of the party, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday the ASBP political committee convened under
the chairmanship of Khaddam and with the participation of Lahmar,
who is also chairman of the congress, the Arab-Syrian News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting focused on domestic and Arab situations.
It underscored the importance of Arab joint action and unification
of the Arab ranks in the face of risks and challenges posed by the
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Portugal Makes Last-Ditch Attempt on Tax Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Portugal,
that is hosting a two-day European Union summit, gave it a last go
on Sunday to forge an accord on cross-border savings taxation.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the 15 EU member states arrived a day
earlier than the heads of state and government for a special
council that was expected to forge an accord on how to levy tax on
cross-border savings.
</P>
<P>
The accord, once signed into law, will affect EU citizens of
the 15-nation bloc irrespective of where they live.
</P>
<P>
Yet the issue of taxes on non-resident savings accounts to
deter tax evasion has divided the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Britain was opposed to such an accord as it perceived a threat
to the lucrative eurobond market based in the City of London.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg was also opposed to the accord as it is also an
attraction to cross-border savings thanks to its low savings tax.
The country, like Austria, has a tradition of banking secrecy.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg and Austria were blocking the proposals that banking
information on bank accounts held by non-national residents be
exchanged to help solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
At the last EU finance minister council on June 6, Portugal,
that is holding the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation
bloc, suggested a compromise proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese proposed a "coexistence" model by which EU
member states can opt for either direct taxes on cross-border
savings or exchange information on bank accounts held by non-
national residents. The model was proposed to exist indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The issue of tax reformation has been hindering the internal
reforms of the European Union which is also trying to reform its
voting mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government are meeting in this town 40
kilometers south of the northern Portuguese city of Porto on June
19 and 20, to discuss a range of issues including internal reforms,
European defense and lifting the sanctions against Austria.

<HEADLINE> Russia Delays U.N. Council's Endorsement on Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday requested
the United Nations Security Council delay to endorse the
conclusion by the U.N.Secretary-General that Israel had withdrawn
its forces from Southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Russian Envoy Vladimir Sergeev as the
Council was going to have a formal meeting to consider a
presidential statement on the subject.
</P>
<P>
"we would likely clarify before we take a decision. As far as
we know there is additional information which is directly related
to this item," Sergeev said.
</P>
<P>
British Envoy Stewart Eldon, who apparently got angry, said" I
would simply point out the matter we are currently considering is
urgent."
</P>
<P>
"We have already spent a long time considering it. We hope the
break will be short and we will be able to present this in a short
session," Eldon added.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the 15-member Security Council
had reached agreement on the presidential statement after 10 hours
of negotiations Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement calls on the Lebanese Government to ensure the
return of its effective authority and to maximize its presence in
the south.
</P>
<P>
It welcomes the measures taken by the Secretary-General to
beef up the 4,500 U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, but it
stresses that the U.N. redeployment to the border should be
carried out in coordination with the redeployment of the Lebanese
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Friday that Israel
had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with
Resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon on Friday and Saturday rejected Annan's
announcement, saying that Israeli forces are still on Lebanon's
soil.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer zone against guerrilla attacks. It announced
its withdrawal on may 24.

<HEADLINE> Schussel Criticizes Portugal for Lack of Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA MARIA DA FEIRA, Portugal, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The federal
chancellor of Austria on Sunday criticized Portugal for lack of
dialogue with his country on the issue of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schussel, who arrived for the June 19-20 European
Union summit of heads of state and government, said after meeting
with European Christian Democrat leaders that Portugal, that is
holding the rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc, should
communicate with its EU partner more.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that there has been such communication with the
media and not directly with us," said the federal chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the presidency, we want a proposal that will
mark the beginning of the end of sanctions, as until now there has
been nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is coming toward the end of its six-month presidency.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern European nation announced in January on behalf
of all the other EU member states a political sanction against
Austria just prior to the swear-in of its coalition government on
February 4.
</P>
<P>
Austria's EU partners threatened with and later applied
political boycotts and non-support for Austria's running for posts
in international institutions after Schussel's conservative People
's Party had reached an agreement with Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party in forming the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member states including Finland and Italy are now keen
on finding a way out of the measures against Austria whereas
others including France and Belgium are still taking a hard-line
against Austria.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama visited Vienna last
Friday and acknowledged that Austria had done nothing "unorthodox"
in the European Union or domestic legislation.
</P>
<P>
Gama proposed that Austria adopt a gentler approach toward its
EU partners and a new analysis be made to decide whether to lift
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But the Austrian chancellor rejected the Gama proposal of
putting Austria under observation as a prelude to lifting the
sanctions. He described the observation proposal without dialogue
as "animal experiments".
</P>
<P>
In a sign of conciliation, however, EU heads of state and
government have agreed to line up with Schussel for the usual
family photo during the two-day summit starting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
A few leaders had refused to appear in a family photo in March
when the previous EU summit was held. The then visiting Mexican
president had to join in to group the EU leaders for a photo.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Urges Britain to Fund Zimbabwe's Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki on Sunday called on the British government to abide by the
1998 land conference agreement in which they agreed to fund
Zimbabwe's land redistribution plans.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government was making legitimate demands on
Britain to foot the bill of that country's land redistribution
process, President Thabo Mbeki said in an interview with the South
African Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the Zimbabwean government had committed itself to
pay for the redistribution of land.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached at the 1998 land conference stipulates
that Britain funds the redistribution of 841 farms to landless
blacks in Zimbabwe. But Britain withheld the funding, citing its
fear that the redistribution process would go against Britain's
demands.
</P>
<P>
"This land was seized from the African people by colonial power
and handed to whites, then they (Zimbabweans) are saying, I think
quite legitimately, 'Why must we pay for it?'," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said his "quiet diplomacy" approach to the Zimbabwean
land crisis had never been questioned by international
communities, but by a section of the South African population.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his recent statement in Parliament that white
South Africans need not fear that the Zimbabwean crisis might
spill over to this country as the law would have to be enforced.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South African government
officials, including President Thabo Mbeki, on Sunday attended the
funeral of Chief Justice Ismail Mahomed who died of cancer on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the Laudium home of Mahomed near Pretoria, Mbeki
told reporters he was devastated by the death of the chief
justice.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great loss for the country and all our people.
Beyond our borders, many will also be distraught by his death,"
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he had known Mahomed for years, and relied heavily
on him to help bring about change in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It will be very difficult to replace a man of his
intelligence, tenacity and discipline," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Mahomed, 68, died in a Johannesburg clinic on Saturday
afternoon. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier in the
year.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and other mourners joined the solemn 20-minute walk to
the mosque, where they took off their shoes before entering.
</P>
<P>
After a prayer of about three minutes, the coffin was taken to
Pretoria West cemetery, where Mahomed was laid to rest.

<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
on Sunday with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers to
review global, regional and local economic changes, Egyptian
Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Summers tackled economic globalization and its
effect on developing countries, in addition to Egyptian-U.S.
economic and trade relations, said Ghali, who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also touched on the role of the Group-15 in changing the
world views on the developing world, he added
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members from Africa, Asia and Latin America are
scheduled to open their two-day summit here on Monday to deal with
the world economic development trends and seek common stances as
well as inter-group cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Summers said the
Egyptian economy has experienced profound changes over the past 10
years, which gave the country potential for opportunities in
investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on Egypt to continue the privatization of
banks for the creation of more private banking.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official expressed hope that the two countries will
forge closer economic cooperation in the coming years, as Egypt
will be pursuing more private sector-oriented banking.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began the privatization process of bank in 1999 by selling
its shares in banks set up in cooperation with foreign partners. It
is to sell its shares in four such banks this year.
</P>
<P>
Summers arrived here Saturday at the start of his African tour,
which will also take him to Nigeria, Tanzania, South Africa and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the second-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel.

<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sunday to discuss
the world economic development and bilateral relations ahead of the
Group-15 summit beginning on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Egyptian Economy and
Foreign Trade Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali said the two leaders
dealt with the general international economic and financial issues,
and coordinated the two countries' positions during the two-day
summit.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Mahathir also tackled the policies adopted by
Malaysia when the Asian financial crisis erupted in the summer of
1998, Ghali said, adding that the Malaysian prime minister
expressed hope to benefit from Egypt's experience in economic
reform and privatization.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off the economic reform program in 1991. The
process, considered as one of the most successful in the world, has
largely improved the country's macroeconomic situation and created
positive environment for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived in Cairo on Saturday for the G-15 summit. He
has reportedly called for unity among developing nations to stand
up against what he said discriminatory policies set by developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 was founded in 1989 to enhance economic and trade
cooperation among developing nations. It has 17 member states,
namely Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia,
Kenya, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri
Lanka, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Denies Rebels Place in Proposed Interim Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said on
Sunday that there is no space for separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in
the proposed interim council for the war-torn North-East Province.
</P>
<P>
"Only those representatives of the registered Tamil, Muslim,
and Sinhala democratic political parties representing the North-
East should participate in the proposed Interim Council," a
government press release quoted President Kumaratunga as saying.
</P>
<P>
The release came as some organizations had made statements
alleging the government had agreed to establish an interim council
with the support of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The release said the government's stand is that "the LTTE could
participate in an Interim Council only on entering the democratic
political mainstream by shunning all murderous terrorist
activities."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a independent homeland
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has banned LTTE, and branded it as a terrorist
organization that has been accused of plotting dozens of terrorist
bomb attacks in recent years against government officials,
security forces and economic targets.
</P>
<P>
The release said the government reached agreement with the main
opposition United National Party last week that referendum would
be the means of deciding whether the Northern and Eastern
Provinces should be merged as one province or should be separated.
</P>
<P>
It added that until the referendum is held, an interim council
would be established to administer the currently merged North-East
Province.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets On Israeli Withdrawal From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua -- The United Nations Security
Council was called into meeting Sunday to endorse the withdrawal
of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met on the same subject Saturday and it is
expected to work out a presidential statement today, which will
endorse the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern
Lebanon, thus paving the way for the United Nations to strengthen
its peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Council's move came after the announcement by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday that Israeli forces had
completely withdrawn to their side of the border as stipulated
under a 1978 Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon on Friday and Saturday rejected Annan's
announcement, saying Israeli forces are still on Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
The Council held long consultations Saturday on the
presidential statement but failed to reach agreement due to
divisions among them.
</P>
<P>
The Council was called into a formal meeting this morning but
it was suspended at the request of Russia, one of the five
permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Russia said it needed more time to consider the decision and
Security Council should continue consultations before the formal
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential statement calls on Lebanese Government to
ensure the return of its effective authority and to maximize its
presence in the south.
</P>
<P>
It welcomes measures taken by the Secretary-General to beef up
the 4,500 U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, but it stresses
that U.N. redployment to the border shall be carried out in
coordination with the redployment of the Lebanese armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will visit Lebanon Monday
and the Security Council is under pressure to endorse the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) is taking vigorous initiatives
to develop the information technology industry to make Hong Kong
an international city with an economy dominated by a combination
of advanced technology and sophisticated services.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong SAR,
predicted during his U.S. tour this month that Hong Kong could
become the "cyber city for the cyber century."
</P>
<P>
As one small example of how quickly the Internet boom has taken
off, Tsang said, in the past 12 months there has been an almost
800 percent increase - from 199 to 1,540 - in the number of
companies incorporated in Hong Kong with the character string ".
com".
</P>
<P>
The significant concentration of Internet service providers,
now numbering nearly 200, has made Hong Kong one of the best ISP-
served communities in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce transactions in Hong Kong are forecast to jump to
some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars-worth in 2003 from 1998's 60 million
U.S. dollars-worth, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
IT professionals have fingered Hong Kong's excellent
telecommunications infrastructure as a contributing factor in kick-
starting the new economy. Hong Kong's broadband network covers
practically all business buildings, and the residential coverage
is expected to reach 85 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Lau Kam-hung, director of Hong Kong's information technology
services, said the government is fully committed to encouraging
the development of e-commerce to maintain Hong Kong's competitive
edge and to power its overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As a practical expression of its commitment, the Hong Kong SAR
government promulgated the Digital 21 IT Strategy in November 1998,
which sets out the vision and targets to enhance and promote Hong
Kong's information infrastructure and services so as to make Hong
Kong a leading digital city in the globally connected world of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
In taking the lead to carry out the strategy, the Hong Kong SAR
government has introduced the Electronic Service Delivery (ESD)
Scheme to improve the delivery of public services and help
familiarize the citizens with the e-commerce mode of delivery.
</P>
<P>
Under this scheme, public services will be provided over the
Internet and through other electronic means via an open and common
information infrastructure 24 hours a day and seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme, to be launched in October this
year, will enable the public to have access to a wide range of
services provided by government departments. These services
include the submission of tax returns, voter registration,
application for renewal of driving and vehicle licenses, payment
of government bills, booking appointment for ID card registration,
information for tourists, etc.

<TEXT>
<P>
Besides ESD, the Hong Kong SAR government is also working on
other projects like the Interactive Government Services Directory
and the Electronic Tendering System, that aim to familiarize the
citizens with the electronic world and to promote the wider
adoption of e-commerce in the community.
</P>
<P>
To address the current problem of using Chinese in electronic
communications and transactions, which hampers the adoption of e-
commerce by the local community, the Hong Kong SAR government
published the Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set in September
1999.
</P>
<P>
The government is also taking an active role in discussions
with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on
the development of the ISO 10646 standard, which is intended to
encompass all written scripts, including the Chinese characters
commonly used in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the government is going to adopt the ISO 10646
standard as the open and common Chinese language interface in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that electronic transactions can be performed
effectively and efficiently over the Internet, the Legislative
Council of the Hong Kong SAR enacted the Electronic Transactions
Ordinance in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance provides a clear and supportive legal framework
for the conduct of e-commerce in Hong Kong. Electronic records and
digital signatures are given the same legal status as that of
their paper-based counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Apart from facilitating and promoting the development of the
local IT industry, the Hong Kong SAR government has also financed
technology development projects and research undertaken by the
industry and academia through various funding schemes, such as the
Innovation and Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
By implementing these various initiatives, the Hong Kong SAR
government aims to create a user-friendly environment for the
development of e-commerce to spur the SAR's economic growth, Lau
Kam-hung said.

<HEADLINE> Abundant Relics Unearthed from Turkey's Ancient Zeugma Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Plenty of artifacts have been
unearthed from southern Turkey's ancient Zeugma site which is
threatened to be flooded by a Dam, since the government ordered to
step up excavations.
</P>
<P>
Seven villas, 65,000 bullas, a bronze statue of Mars, small
channels, many statues, tap apparatus, animal and plant-decorated
water installation equipment, frescos, and 2,000 square metre
mosaics have been found at the site, a Roman Ruin in the southern
Gaziantep province.
</P>
<P>
Those artifacts will be displayed in the Culture Center which is
being constructed in the garden of Gaziantep Ancient Site, Anatolia
news agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zeugma is called a "second Pompeii" by some archaeologists
because it shelters the unique bronze statue of war and fascinating
mosaics dating back to the Roman times.
</P>
<P>
Turkey quickened the pace of excavations as some parts of the
site will be subject to flooding by the Birecik Dam across the
Euphrates River, one of the government's ambitious plans to
generate electric power and irrigate vast areas of dry land.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the would-be-inundated site has drawn the attention
of high-level officials. Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit will
visit the site on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The ancient site was found by German archaeologist Jorg Wagner
in 1976 and systematic excavations were launched by the Gaziantep
Archeology Museum in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the site of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities,
boasts of antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Names New PM to Speed up Reforms 1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- In a step to spur economic reforms,
Jordanian King Abdullah on Sunday named leading parliamentarian Ali
Abu Ragheb as new prime minister to succeed Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh,
informed sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The lame duck prime minister was seen meeting with foreign
visitors Sunday morning, but Ali Abu Ragheb, 54, may take over as
early as Sunday evening, or at most in a couple of days, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb is expected to submit to King Abdullah the name list of
his new cabinet, comprising 27 to 29 ministers who are either known
as veteran politicians or young technocrats.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, chairman of the financial and economic affairs committee
and two-time minister of industry and trade in 1991-93 and 1995,
has risen in the eyes of Abdullah for his efficiency in drawing a
master plan to develop the southern harbor city of Aqaba into the
kingdom's largest special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old monarch was seen eager to carry out
understandings reached with the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund and other major creditors to accelerate economic
development in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe Ragheb will help usher in a more
harmonious era between the government and the parliament,
particularly with the 80-member house of deputies or the lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, though widely seen as a conservative, has been at odds
with the house over political and economic policies, including its
crack-down upon muslim dissidents, the privatization of key but
non-profitable state enterprises, an introduction of a 10-percent
sales tax which triggered a price hike in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, a U.S.-educated engineer, believes that parliamentarians
should be included in the government or cabinet, and he might
summon a few of his fellow house members into his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh has tided over several confidence crises during his 15-
month service as prime minister, including a rumor that his son was
asking for millions of U.S. dollars in bribes from potential
foreign investors to help them win construction contracts in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh managed to keep its job as the kingdom, which had
suffered a decade-old economic recession following the 1990 Gulf
Crisis, achieved a rare 1.5 percent economic growth in 1999 and is
eyeing for a three percent growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
But his failure to win support from the house and a lack of
personal charisma is costing him his job now, as the 38-year-old
king expects harmony between the legislature and government as the
kingdom is heading for a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, given his liberal economic background, is widely
expected to follow the economic and reform policies of Rawabdeh,
which were also endorsed by Abdullah.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for Observance of Palestinian Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei stressed here on Sunday the legitimate rights of the
Palestinian people must be observed in order to achieve peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The rights of the Palestinian nation cannot be ignored, nor can
the rights of several million Palestinian refugees be overlooked,
Khamenei said in a meeting with United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the U.N.'s effective part in settling the Middle East
dilemma, Khamenei also expressed his unhappiness with the multi-
standards the U.N. follows in resolving international issues due to
the dominance of certain powers.
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the stance of the U.N. and the
Security Council in helping resolve international issues because
the world body does not follow a single standard in dealing with
international issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon,
the leader pointed out the Lebanon-Israel dispute "has not come to
an end", noting that Israel must withdraw from other Lebanese
lands, namely the Shebba Farms on Lebanon's border with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports the Lebanese people vindicating their rights and
the dispute between Lebanon and Israel should be resolved in a way
that all the Lebanese territory be handed over to Lebanon, Khamenei
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general presented a report to Khamenei on the
withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon and the U.N.
activities on border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the assistance of Iran and other regional
countries in helping resolve the Middle East issues.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived here Sunday within his week-long Middle East tour.
During the one-day visit, he also conferred with Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on the latest
developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Annan has left Tehran for Cairo to continue his regional tour.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Deregulate Furnace Oil Imports: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Shaukat Aziz said Sunday the government has decided to deregulate
the furnace oil imports and the prices of Liquid Petroleum Gas (
LPG).
</P>
<P>
With this decision the private sector will be allowed to freely
import and distribute furnace oil, he said at the post-budget
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the price of LPG will be deregulated from September
2000 with the commencement of production in the PARCO Refinery
that would add 450 tons of LPG to the existing supplies of 540
tons in the market.
</P>
<P>
With this development Pakistan might be in a position to export
LPG, as the expanded supplies would be more than the local demand,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said regulatory agencies namely the Gas
Regulatory Authority (GRA) and Petroleum Regulatory Board (PRB)
are being established to independently regulate the activities of
the oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Presently, he said, huge amounts of foreign exchange are spent
on the import of furnace oil used for generating electricity at
power stations.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is making every effort to exploit the
country's natural gas potential so that the power stations can be
shifted from furnace oil to gas not only to save foreign exchange
but also to reduce the electricity tariff.

<HEADLINE> Expanding Revenue Base Key Target of Budget 2000-2001: Shaukat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Finance Minister
Shaukat Aziz said on Sunday the primary focus of the newly issued
budget is towards expanding the revenue base to give sizable
allocation to the development sector and poverty reduction program.
</P>
<P>
"This budget mirrors direction of the government's economic
policy with major thrust on creating fiscal discipline and
ensuring stringent expenditure control," the minister added while
addressing a post-budget press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Shaukat Aziz said the budgetary proposals envisage a three-year
framework with clear-cut objectives to be realized at the end of
the third year.
</P>
<P>
This framework, he assured, would ensure consistency and
continuity in the economic policies and approach of the government
to achieve the specific targets for the ultimate revival of the
sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night Shaukat issued the budget for 2000-2001, the
first by the current military government which assumed power last
October and has been ruled by the Supreme Court to hand over the
power to an elected government within three years.
</P>
<P>
Shaukat said significant effort was made in the budget to
reduce the fiscal deficit from 193.1 billion rupees (3.64 billion
U.S. dollars) or 6.1 percent of GDP to 162.1 billion rupees (3.06
billion dollars) or 4.6 percent of GDP during the next fiscal year
besides ensuring 24 percent increase in tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The tax to GDP ratio is estimated to improve from 11 percent to
12.4 percent in the next fiscal which commences in July.
</P>
<P>
Increase in the current budgetary expenditures has been
restricted to two percent while development expenditures reflects
around 20 percent increase in the budget, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Special focus is put on poverty alleviation. Out of the 120.4
billion rupees (2.27 billion dollars) of Public Sector Development
Program, 21.2 billion rupees (0.4 billion dollars)is allocated to
poverty alleviation, against merely 3.5 billion rupees (0.07
billion dollars) in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
Spelling out specific targets of the three-year framework
carved in the budget, Shaukat said, GDP is estimated to grow at
six percent annually with inflation to be contained around four
percent by the end of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Investment to GDP ratio will increase to 18 percent and fiscal
deficit decline to 3.5 percent of GDP, he said, adding, current
account deficit will be brought down to about 0.5 per cent of GDP
from 2.4 percent during the year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves will increase to nearly 12 weeks of
imports from the present level of 4 weeks of imports under the
three-year framework, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, the minister said Information Technology
is given immense concessions and tax incentives which would
provide a tremendous push to the development of this sector and
generate employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out possibility of any devaluation of Pakistani rupee,
adding that there is stability in the exchange rate, controlled by
supply and demand forces of the market.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said a comprehensive strategy was carved
by the Debt Management Committee to tackle the debt situation in
the country. The major objective of this exercise is to achieve
self reliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
He concluded the country would seek loans but only for the
development purposes on commercial basis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hails Agreement on Elimination of Child Labor in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) - The United States welcomed the
agreement signed in Geneva on June 16 to continue the program to
eliminate child labor from Bangladesh's garment industry, a
special release of the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Highly appreciating the 1995 Memorandum of Understanding MOU)
initiated by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters
Association (BGMEA), the International Labor Organization (ILO)
and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the special
release hoped the one-year extension of the agreement will promote
the progress.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will continue providing education and
rehabilitation assistance to the retrenched child workers and
facilitate the development of a new framework to ensure garment
factories free of child labor, the release said.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the 1995 MOU, the first agreement of its kind
in the world, should be attributed to the hard work and commitment
of the three parties of the MOU," the release said.
</P>
<P>
It said Bangladesh's garment manufacturers and exporters have
demonstrated that an industry can eliminate child labor
voluntarily and in a socially responsible way, and this effort can
contribute to booming production and exports by reducing the
concern of buyers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
The United States is pleased to assist in the success of the
1995 MOU through contributions totaling 1.7 million U.S. dollars
from the U.S. Department of Labor, almost all of which went to the
ILO-managed factory monitoring program, said the release.
</P>
<P>
"The United States looks forward to continuing this
participation under the new agreement in the next year."

<HEADLINE> Somali Capital Remains Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Somali capital city of
Mogadishu is calm despite its hosting of several warlords opposing
to the Djibouti peace conference now continuing its second and
last face for the establishment of a government for the country.
</P>
<P>
It is now quite normal in every corner of Mogadishu to hear
every now and then the thunderous double explosions of the
anti-aircraft rockets being tested in the air by the militiamen of
the faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
The warlords are not just quiet, but seem to be preparing
themselves for the worst to happen when their current ostensible
international isolation turns into real segregation from the rest
of the leaders in terms of their constituency and influence in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Every morning since the Djibouti peace conference began 47 days
ago, the people in Mogadishu had their morning tea over talks of
the achievements the meeting has made in the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
And Sunday's discussion was how the delegates have miraculously
and courageously chosen Hassan Abshir Farah (Mogadishu's former
governor from Puntland) and Abdalle Derow from the Rahanwein
Resistance Army as the two co-chairmen of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Both men have left behind the wild political desires of their
leaders Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf (President of Puntland regional
government) and Colonel Hassan Shargudud, chairman of the RRA.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti conference has revived the long ago dead hopes for
the restoration of Somalia's nationhood, said Muhidin Trabune, a
famous whole salesman in Mogadishu's main business center, Bakara
market.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdi Ali, a businessman on the Bakara market, believed
that the warlords won't just sit down idly. It all depends upon
the power the provisional government is equipped with, he said.
</P>
<P>
This will make the warlords either to flee for their lives or
dare fight the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Other businessmen held that the warlords are now being left
with no other alternative, but to fight.
</P>
<P>
The current regrouping of the warlords shows their intention of
 stimulating their closest subclans to fight using all possible
militiamen in an attempt of spreading the war into the entire
clans and the subsequent chaos would destroy any government, said
Farah Aliyow Aw-Ahmed, another businessman in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
President Ismail Omar Ghelleh of Djibouti proposed the
three-point plan in regard to the faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
First, they will officially be invited to attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, if they refuse to accept the invitation, their assets
outside the country will be frozen and their movements abroad the
country will be limited.
</P>
<P>
And third, if the first two don't force them to join the peace
process, a special court will be set up for their indictment to
war crimes during the civil wars in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abdi Mohamed, a businessman and a politician, said that
the three- point plan will be another factor forcing the warlords
to fight.
</P>
<P>
Once the provisional government comes into Mogadishu, Hussein
Aidid, Mohamed Qanyare, Osman Atto and Muse Sudi Yalahow will be
the first to challenge it, Mohamed added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday expressed
satisfaction with the signing of a cease-fire agreement between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"The sides have taken a step to laying the foundation for the
transition of the settlement of existing territorial differences
to a solely peaceful channel," the Russian Foreign Ministry said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and his Eritrean
counterpart, Haile Woldensae, inked the accord in an official
ceremony in Algiers, Algeria, earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate the statesmanship and the understanding
of the futility of the military solution to the problem that has
been demonstrated in both capitals," the Russian Foreign Ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The next item on the agenda "is a speedy signing by the sides
of other fundamental settlement documents and their consequent
practical implementation," the Interfax news agency quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly convinced that only such a course of
developments meets the vital interests of Eritrea and Ethiopia and
also the Horn of Africa as a whole. Russia as a U.N. Security
Council permanent member is ready to continue to give all-round
assistance to the peace process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement calls for an immediate cessation of
hostilities between the two sides and the deployment of a U.N.
peacekeeping force in a 25-kilometer buffer zone until the
disputed border is demarcated.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Roads built with World Bank (WB)
loans have brought hope for prosperity to people living in a poor
area in north China.
</P>
<P>
Six roads with a total length of 204 kilometers have been built
in a poor mountainous area of Shanxi province, where
transportation has long been a headache. Some 250,000 people in
the area will benefit from the new roads.
</P>
<P>
Yuncheng, a city in the southern part of Shanxi Province, close
to the Yellow River, has received 1.196 billion yuan (about 144
million U.S. dollars) in WB loans since 1996. With coordinated
investment from governments at various levels, Yuncheng has made
use of the loans and investment to fight poverty by developing
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing, electricity
generation and farm product processing.
</P>
<P>
For example, a plant processing dehydrated vegetables now makes
10 million yuan in profits annually. Besides, it provides
employment for over 1,000 local women.

<HEADLINE> Secluded Grottoes to Open to Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yunlin Grottoes, a major yet
secluded part of the renowned Dunhuang Caves in the northwest
China province of Gansu, are expected to open to visitors soon.
</P>
<P>
With a five-year consolidation project costing over seven
million yuan nearing its end, the grottoes are expected to first
open to visitors as part of a series of activities to be held to
mark the 100th anniversary of the discovery of the Sutras Cave at
Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the resplendent and magnificent frescoes in the
Mogao Grottoes, the murals in the Yulin Grottoes are simple and
elegant. Different in general tone as they are, the two groups of
grottoes are closely related in carving, fresco content and
artistic style, said Wang Wanfu, a deputy director in charge of
preservation work at the Dunhuang Research Academy.
</P>
<P>
"The Yulin and Dunhuang grottoes complement each other
perfectly as representatives of Dunhuang culture," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Located in a desert ravine, the Yulin Grottoes are home to 41
caves featuring exquisite frescoes covering more than 1,000 sq m
and over 1,000 Buddhist statues.
</P>
<P>
Cave 25 is said to be the most exquisite of the Yunlin Grottoes,
with frescoes depicting scenes of everyday life during different
historical periods, including the Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties,
Song Dynasty and Yuan Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Liangfu, an expert on Dunhuang studies, said the
frescoes in Cave 25 are the best-preserved of all the grottoes of
Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The intact nature of the frescoes is mainly attributable to the
special geological location of the grottoes and government
protection measures, said Li Zuixiong, vice-president of the
Dunhuang Research Academy. The first road to the Yulin Grottoes
was built in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Yulin Grottoes were listed as a cultural heritage site
under first-class state protection in 1961.

SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- With China's entry into the WTO
approaching, China is facing a big opportunity to develop its
logistics industry, said experts at the "China Logistics 2000"
symposium which ended Friday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the World Bank and the Asia Pacific Logistics
Institute said that China's stable open policy, continuous
economic development, potential market, and low-cost labor force
provides an excellent basis for developing China's logistic
industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics said that the total amount of imports and exports
increased from 20.6 billion US dollars in 1978 to 194.9 billion US
dollars in 1999. China cut its tariff to 17 percent last year and
did trade business with 227 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Modern logistics is made up of different sectors such as
booking, transportation, storage, processing, and distribution.
China needs to make all the sectors connected to become a network,

<HEADLINE> Iran's New Parliament Reviews Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's newly inaugurated sixth
Majlis (parliament) on Sunday approved a motion to review the press
law which was amended by the conservative dominated fifth Majlis in
April.
</P>
<P>
In an open session presided over by speaker Mehdi Karrubi, the
new parliament approved the motion submitted by 106 parliament
members, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the press law by the conservative fifth parliament
has, in recent months, triggered a mass suspension of 17 reformist
papers and periodicals and led to the imprisonment of a number of
reformist journalists on charges they "disparaged Islam and the
ideals of the Islamic revolution."
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Bourqani, a parliament member from Tehran and a main
architect of the motion, said the suspension of the mass-circulated
periodicals is similar to the closure of schools in society.
</P>
<P>
If a thought is not allowed to emerge, it will lead to dogmatism
which is a big threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another parliament member from Tehran, Seyed Hadi Khamenei, also
said the approval of the amendments to the press law by the fifth
parliament was "a move taken hurriedly."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that a proper solution would be find to the
issue so as to ease press challenges and anxieties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 151 members of the newly convened
parliament have written a letter to head of the judiciary Mahmoud
Hashemi Shahroudi, demanding an urgent action to ease the
restrictive press law, IRNA reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"...the incorrect action of the Tehran justice department
against the press in recent months has not only diminished its
reputation in the public mind but is an affront to the nation," the
letter read in part.
</P>
<P>
It termed the imprisonment of journalists as an "insensible"
action and called for serious considerations in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament, which started functioning on May 27, is
dominated by reformists supporting moderate policies of President
Mohammad Khatami.

East region, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troop pullout from south Lebanon on May 24,
ending 22 years of occupation there. The Israeli action was in
compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolution 425, adopted
more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi termed the Israeli withdrawal as a great victory for
the Lebanese nation and its resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
Calling the current situation of the region as sensitive, he
urged the international community to exert pressure on Israel to
withdraw from other occupied lands and release all Lebanese
prisoners.
</P>
<P>

N. resolutions on Palestine, critical situation in Afghanistan and
issues related to the fighting of narcotic drugs.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Enter Arms Race: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will not enter arms
race with any country and will instead follow a peaceful path of
socio-economic development, said Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz in
his post-budget press conference here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said this when asked why Pakistan has not substantially
raised its defense expenditure while its neighbor has done so
considerably.
</P>
<P>
In the government's opinion the country must have a credible
defense, which is important for peace, the minister said, but
adding that the armed forces' requirements to protect the country
has been provided in the budget 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
"We want to defend our homeland and also move towards the goal
of socio-economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaukat said the defense expenditure has in fact been increased
by 10 percent in the new budget, which is sufficient to meet the
defense requirements.
</P>
<P>
He also appreciated the defense establishment for using the
budget "very efficiently."
</P>
<P>
In its new budget issued Saturday night, Pakistan projected the
defense expenditure at 133.5 billion rupees (2.52 billion U.S.
dollars), 6.9 percent lower as compared with the previous year's
143.3 billion rupees (2.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the decrease was achieved as the expenditure on
military pensions was shifted to the general administration for
the first time in the history of the country, thus 26.1 billion
rupees (0.49 billion dollars) for all practical purposes was not
mentioned in the actual defense budget.

TOKYO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Dutch women stunned China on Sunday
by beating the Atlanta Olympic silver medallists in the women's
volleyball last qualifying tournament for the Sydney Olympic Games
here.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch spikers needed only 77 minutes to score a 25-22, 25-
20, 25-20 victory over the Chinese, who had to compete at this
tournament after finishing fifth in the World Cup earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We know the Chinese are difficult to beat, but they are
missing a three-meter attack and that's why we made solid strategy,
" said Dutch head coach Pierre Mathieu.
</P>
<P>
"We were able to play our net defence so good that Wu Yongmei
and Li Shan couldn't score. Our three-meter attack, especially by
Henriette (Weersing), was very good. She was also very good at the
net.
</P>
<P>
"China took most of their points through serving and our
mistakes, but we made a lot of points by serving, blocking and
with our defence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Hu Jin said: "We are confident that we can go to
the Olympics. Although we were beaten today, we have some more
matches. I'm sure we can go to Sydney."
</P>
<P>
In other actions on Sunday, Italy beat South Korea 25-10, 26-24,
28-26, Croatia defeated Argentina 25-19, 25-15, 25-12 while Japan
beat Canada 25-18, 25-16, 25-15.
</P>
<P>
The country which finishes top will take the first ticket for
Sydney. Then the top Asian country will qualify as Asian
qualifiers, and the best two teams among the remaining six
countries will get the last two places for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Archaeological Finds In South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
excavated more than 300 graves dating back to before the Qin
Dynasty (221-207 BCE) in Hengling Ridge in Boluo County, south
China's Guangdong Province, which they say prove the history of
civilization in the region goes back farther than they thought.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists said today that the major find is evidence that
the Five Ridges Region, another name for present-day Guangdong
Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region may have existed
more than 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The archaeological finds were made by workers with Guangdong
Provincial Cultural Heritage and Archaeology Institute. They began
excavations last July.
</P>
<P>
Professor Li Boqian with the archaeology department of Beijing
University believed implements unearthed at the Hengling Ridge
provide an important benchmark in the study of the ancient state
called "Fulou Kingdom."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier On Three Gorges Project Construction Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
stressed that construction quality is the essential part of the
Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the just-concluded Ninth Plenary Session of the
Three Gorges Project Construction Committee (TGPCC) under the
State Council, the premier urged the builders to step up
environmental protection and ecological construction in the dam
area and do a good job in the resettlement of local people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also head of the Three Gorges Project Construction
Committee, added that efforts should still be made to readjust the
industrial structures of the enterprises removed from the dam area,
so as to realize coordinated development in the economic and
social aspects as well as in ecological and environmental
construction.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bangguo, vice-premier and deputy head of the TGPCC, and Qian
Zhengying, leader of the project's quality supervision group, also
attended the session.
</P>
<P>
The session fully confirmed the achievements and progress made
in the eight years since the project was launched. The successful
damming of the Yangtze River on November 8, 1997 marked the
completion of the first phase of the project.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the project, started in 1998, has been
going smoothly, with the quality level being good in general.
</P>
<P>
By April this year, the Three Gorges Project had completed
earth and stone work totaling 168.8 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
And by March this year, some 227,000 people living in the dam
area had been resettled in residences with floor space totaling 13.
33 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
The plenary meeting urged all the builders to bear in mind
their historical responsibility, and give top priority to the
construction quality of this gigantic project.
</P>
<P>
The session called on parties concerned to complete the task of
resettling local people to ensure that water storage in the dam
can be completed by 2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea signed here on
Sunday morning a cease fire deal to end their 2-year-long border
dispute, according to Algerian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and his Eritrean
counterpart Haile Woldensae inked the accord in an official
ceremony attended by Algerian president and current Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Chairman AbdelAziz Bouteflika, OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim, U.S. Presidential envoy Anthony Lake, EU
envoy to the Horn of African Region Rino Seri and foreign
ambassadors in Algiers, said the report.

Addressing the ceremony, Bouteflika praised the deal as "a
historical event" which crowned the efforts made to restore peace
and stability in the Horn of Africa Region.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal calls for an immediate truce and the deployment
of a U.N. peace keeping force in a 25-kilometer buffer zone in

<HEADLINE> Thai Fast-food Challenges Int'l Giants (2) by Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "brand name effect" is equally important in the Chester's
success story, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Out of such consideration, the name "the Chester's" was
intentionally created to be easily read and remembered by
customers, after repeated consultations with many company image
experts, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
A unique food style is the third important factor, Adirek said.
</P>
<P>
"With the western style fast food becoming a fashion in
Thailand today, the customers, especially teenagers, have already
adopted the style. So we decided to mix the Thai and western
styles in our fast food, thus making an special attraction."
</P>
<P>
The grilled chicken, which is the Chester's brand food, can be
seen as a kind of typical Thai-western mixture, with western ways
of grilling and Thai spices combined together, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of style is more suitable for the Thai people, and
is welcomed by more and more customers," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The last factor for success, Adirek stated, is the adoption of
the international standards.
</P>
<P>
"During more than a decade of experience of running fast-food
business, I realized that if we want to compete with international
big chain stores, we should keep improving our production,
management, service and everything else to meet international
standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Strict training for employees, imposing same food production
standards in every branches, creating a modern inside-store
environment and initiating a quick delivery service, are all the
efforts the Thai fast-food business makes to keep up to the
international level, he remarked.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, for keeping confidence and a high
profile, the Chester's mainly focuses on the big cities.
</P>
<P>
"We know the competition in big cities is intense, but we
resolve to learn from competition, and grow up through competition,
" a smiling Adirek said, hinting the company is now considering
exploring overseas markets, to take on the giants on the
international battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The CP success story has also inspired other Thai fast-food
stores to emerge, for the moment, the S&AMP;P and M&AMP;K.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the group's prospect, he stressed, "we are both
confident and realistic. we know we still have a long way to go,
but we see the hope and we will carry on our efforts."

<HEADLINE> Indian Steel Giant to Cut Workforce in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The SAIL, which now produces 10 million tons of steel a year,
will start a fresh round of voluntary retirement in the next two
to three months, the PTI quoted company chairman Arvind Pande as
saying in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
According to the corporate plan prepared by the company, Bokaro
Steel Plant, which now has a 43,000-strong workforce, would have
30,000 employees by 2004, Pande told the PTI.
</P>
<P>
About 19,000 employees had already opted for voluntary
retirement in SAIL in the last two years, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that in the current financial year, the company's
loss is expected to be curtailed by 50 percent over those incurred
in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The SAIL incurred a loss of 1.82 billion rupees (42.3 million U.
S. dollars) during the April-May period this year against 4.19
billion rupees (97.4 million U.S. dollars) during the
corresponding period last year, said the PTI.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Ranks First in World Traffic Accidents: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, plagued by poor road
 conditions and congested streets, has ranked the first in the
world in traffic accident, the Fortune weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia loses more than 12 million birr (about 1.45 million
U.S. dollars) annually due to traffic accidents, Mesfin
Bantayehu, a road expert in the capital city of Addis Ababa, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1998, over 28,000 accidents occurred in the
capital, five of which involved death, 25 percent caused light
injuries and 90 percent caused property damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
These accidents were probably connected with traffic congestion
in the city.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin said about 77 percent of the country's nearly 80,000
vehicles are in Addis Ababa, 91 percent of public vehicles and 95
percent of all trucks are in the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
According to Mesfin, there are 9,443 taxis, 335 city buses and
38,244 private vehicles in the capital, 1,360 trucks and 240
buses enter the city daily.
</P>
<P>
In addition to vehicles, non-motorized transport also adds to
the capital's traffic woes. There are nearly 5,000 donkeys in
Addis Ababa, and on market days, over 3,000 additional donkeys
enter the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin expressed the belief that one of the solution to traffic
problems is to have more traffic police. However, the number of
traffic police throughout the country is decreasing from 478 in
1993 to 451 in 1999, he said.

The event will be the first of this kind ever held in the
homeland of the 1,300-year-old unique system of medical research,
clinical practice and drug use.
</P>
<P>
More than 360 Chinese and foreign researchers of Tibetan
medicine have applied for participating the symposium, providing
some 500 papers for academic exchange, said an official with the
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan medicine is a vital part of both the traditional
Tibetan culture and traditional medicine of China. We hope the
meeting will help promote its development for the sake of the
people's health around the world," said Zhu Guoben, president of
the China Medical Association of Minorities.
</P>
<P>
The association is organizing the symposium together with the
health department of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan
Medicine College in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
President Zhu described Tibetan medicine as "having unique
theoretical system, rich experience in clinical practice and
aboriginal pharmaceutical resources" in accordance with high-
altitude, low-temperature and anoxic environment in the Tibet-
Qinghai Plateau, dubbed as "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, Tibetan medicine has still been shared by the
Chinese nation as an important public health resource," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There have been 57 hospitals and three research institutes
specializing in Tibetan medicine throughout China, with more than
3,000 medical professionals. Besides Tibetan medicine colleges set
up in Tibet and Qinghai, Tibetan medicine courses have been
offered in colleges of traditional Chinese medicine in provinces
of Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Thai Fast-food Chain Challenges Int'l Giants by Yang Qingchuan, Huang Yong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 18 (Xinhua) - To challenge the domination of
international fast-food giants of the Thai market, the Charoen
Pokphand (CP) Group, a top company here, has managed to set up and
rapidly expand Thailand's own fast-food business during last 12
years, CP vice president Adirek Sripratak said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In the late 1980s, seeing that the western fast-food brands
flooding into the local fast-food market, we felt it is urgent to
set up Thailand's own fast-food business," Adirek stressed to
Xinhua during an interview.
</P>
<P>
"Our motive was to show to those international giants that we
can be a challenger to them," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he recalled, the situation at the beginning was not
rosy as those big foreign fast-food chain stores had already set
their footing in Thailand. In 1988, the CP Group initiated
Thailand's first fast-food chain: the Chester's.
</P>
<P>
Three famous international fast-food companies from the United
States --the Kentucky Fried Chickens (KFC), Mcdonald's and Pizza
Hut -- entered the Thai market in 1983, 1985 and 1975 respectively,
and the Chester's was naturally a less experienced newcomer.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in terms of capital, technology and marketing
skill, the new Thai fast-food chain was obviously no match for
those big businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The situation was not so nice but we still had the confidence,
because we knew our own advantages," Adirek said.
</P>
<P>
"Our fast-food chain gets firm support from the CP Group, which
is the country's biggest producer of chickens, and we understand
Thai consumers' tastes better than foreign rivals," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Those advantages, he said, combined with advanced management,
unique food style, improved service quality, would lead to success
in the fierce competition.
</P>
<P>
"The Chester's expansion history can best illustrate the point,
" he stated.
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 years, the Chester's has successfully
expanded its business by setting up more that 60 branches all over
the country. Now it enjoys a 10-strong percent market share, and
co-dominates the Thai market with the three giants.
</P>
<P>
Considering the competitive cruelty within the Thai fast-food
market during the recent decade, the Chester's behavior is
impressive, as even some foreign giants, with strong capital and
technological backing, can hardly secure their survival or
development, Adirek noted.
</P>
<P>
There have been nearly a dozen foreign competitors failing or
disappearing from Thailand's fast-food market, namely the Popeyes,
A&AMP;W, BigBoy, ArBy's, Wendy's, Lona Jones Silver, Dairy Queen,
Shery's Pizza and Domino Pizza.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the factors for the chain's success, the senior
executive replied the first is "to be realistic."
</P>
<P>
"In other words, when we design our fast-food strategy, we
should put the whole market into account, comparing the advantages
and disadvantages between ourselves and foreign contenders, to
make our plan pragmatic," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect our fast-food store to 'become a billionaire
overnight', and prefer to go step by step, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Holding a place of number four in terms of market share, the
Chester's now anchors its goal to become number three or number
two in the future, Adirek remarked.

<HEADLINE> Hutton Fails to Beat Free Diving Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- South African diver Trevor Hutton
Saturday failed to break the world free diving record at Cyprus'
southwestern Limassol coast, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
To break the world record, currently held by Moroccan Pierre
Frolla, Hutton had to pass the 72-meter mark on official attempt
days, June 16, 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
During the dive, Hutton managed to reach the mark, but he
blacked out six meters from the surface on the return.
</P>
<P>
He recovered immediately but decided to scrap Sunday's attempts.
</P>
<P>
Hutton, 29, and his 30-member support team had been practising
for the 72-meter dive since last week.
</P>
<P>
A depth difficult enough for the most experienced and well-
equipped scuba diver, free divers descend on a single breath of
air with no breathing apparatus.
</P>
<P>
And in Hutton's category of free apnea, the diver plunges to
depths without the help of fins or weights and only a rope to pull
himself up and down.
</P>
<P>
Hutton, who had managed to equal the record during one of the
practice sessions, said he was thinking of trying again in October.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Turkish Leading Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in Turkish leading newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Rifaat al-Assad, brother of late Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad, came to Turkey three days before the 2000 new year started
asking Turkey to support him replacing his elder brother.
</P>
<P>
Rifaat al-Assad, who understood that his elder brother would
transfer the power to his son Bashar al-Assad rather than himself,
told the Turkish leaders that his elder brother Hafez al-Assad was
pursuing policies against Turkey and that he was the only one who
could change this policy.
</P>
<P>
The visit was under the control of National Intelligence
Organization (MIT). Rifaat al-Assad left Turkey six days later.
</P>
<P>
A government source said that they only listened to Rifaat al-
Assad but later decided to support Bashar al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Cypriots leader Rauf Denktas stressed that the
Turkish Cypriots could not accept the a recent U.N. resolution
which ignores the reality of "two states" and the "equal
sovereignty" of the two sides in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots authorities plans to take measures against
the resolution and the U.N. has to sign a separate agreement with
northern Cypriot authorities if its peacekeeping forces want to
stay in the north of the island.
</P>
<P>
CUMHURIYET (Republic)
</P>
<P>
 -- According to a report prepared by the Turkish intelligence
units, the illegal "Jerusalem Forces" organization has nearly 15,
000 members.

<P>
"Jerusalem Commandos", which involved in assasinations of
secularist journalists and writers is a sub-branch of the "
Jerusalem Forces".
</P>
<P>
The illegal organization was set up under an order of late
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- An aqua fantasy park was officially opened in Selcuk,
south of Izmir, on Saturday to add a new attracting site to the
Aegean coastal tourist route in southwest Turkey, reported Turkish
Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The park, one of Turkey's largest water parks, costs 17 million
U.S. dollars and has numerous special entertainment sections
including a castle, pirate ship, 35 different water slides and
Turkey's first artificial river.
</P>
<P>
A holiday village with a 400-bed capacity will be established in
the park area next year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey has officially promoted eco-tourism, not only
as a source of revenue, but also as an encouragement of eco-
conservation, reported Turkish Daily News on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, rich in eco-tourism resources, has hundreds of species
of birds, thousands of species of flowers including unique
varieties.
</P>
<P>
The British company Green Tours has been selling eco-holidays --
especially the bird-, plant- and butterfly-watching holidays -- in
Turkey for six years. Each year, they send two groups to the Lake
District, the maze of marshes, pastures and mountains north of
Antalya, a Mediterranean port city in south Turkey.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak places research
and development at the top of his economic priorities and favors
increasing the R&AMP;D budget, says an official in the Prime Minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to address revisions of the law governing
state subsidies for corporate research on development at a
government meeting on Sunday. He will endorse the government
support but instruct the Finance MInistry and the Ministry for
Industry and Trade to work out details.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- A plan for developing a joint Web site to promote
tourism to Egypt and Israel will be presented Monday to teams from
both countries at a meeting at the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el
Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 92,000 hotel rooms in Egypt and the number
is expected to more than double within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa and other
cities have drawn tens of millions of dollars from the pockets of
developers with illegal "parking ransoms", as shown by recent
decisions of government planning and construction appeals boards.
</P>
<P>
In a decision handed down two weeks ago, a regional board
invalidated the Jerusalem municipality's demand that, as a
condition for obtaining a construction permit, a developer must pay
a fee in lieu of putting in parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem municipality charges a 20,000 U.S. dollar parking
ransom for each parking space specified by building regulations. In
large projects, the fees may exceed one million shekels (about 250,
000 dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hearings on Zimbabwe Dismissed by Latter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has dismissed the congressional hearings on Zimbabwe being
held in the United States as a ploy to interfere in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, which recently denied reports that it was
working in cahoots with the British Labor government to topple the
Mugabe government, last week started the hearings where former
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker called on his
country to join hands with Britain to dislodge the current
Zimbabwean government from power, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Zimbabwe
Saturday told the newspaper whereas any country could discuss its
relations with another country, it was wrong for institutions of
governments which subscribe to the U.N. Charter to entertain
schemes to subvert democratic processes in the territory of a
fellow member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Attempts to tinker with the political process in
Zimbabwe to produce a result preferred by certain elements in the
United States and elsewhere constitute a violation of principles
of the United Nations Charter, and negate the very principle of
democracy itself."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said from its perspective, Zimbabwe's
relationship with the U.S. was by and large a good one. He
pointed out that the two governments sometimes agreed and at other
times differed in both experience and perspective.
</P>
<P>
However, what he found to be abominable were subversive
elements that he said were on "a malicious campaign of
misinformation and the creation of surrogates."
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, allegations were levelled against the
Zimbabwean government for perceived perpetration of violence
against members of the opposition, ignoring the rule of law and
jeopardizing democracy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that Zimbabwe was in fact upholding
the rule of law, with the police arresting and prosecuting
perpetrators of political violence without regard to political
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and cabinet ministers have denounced such violence and
allowed international observers to observe the forthcoming
parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Coalition Crisis Nearing Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's coalition crisis with
Shas party is nearing solution as Shas representatives and One
Israel negotiators have reached agreements on almost all of the
disputed issues, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has provided more time for
the two sides to reach an agreement on resolving the coalition
crisis by postponing Sunday's cabinet meeting to Tuesday, at which
Shas was announced to submit the resignation of its ministers and
deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held another round of marathon meeting Saturday
night in Tel Aviv, which dealt with "how to implement the reform
plan for the Shas education network.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made on the bailing out Shas' school network,
but the problem of legalizing a Shas' radio network remained, a
senior One Israel official told the radio.
</P>
<P>
The problem on the Shas radio network remains as it still
demands that its stations be included in a new network that would
be created for this purpose, while One Israel argued that legally
it would have to be included in the existing Second Radio and
Television Authority.
</P>
<P>
Shas has demanded millions of shekels to bail out its debet-
ridden school network and its pirate radio stations be legalized,
as conditions for not withdrawing from the coalition and not
supporting the opposition bill asking for early elections of the
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The supervision of Shas education network is the remaining
problem for the two sides, as Shas strongly insisted this
supervision will not be given to Education Ministry headed by Yossi
sarid.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, who is leader of the Meretz party strongly opposing to
allocate more education funds to Shas, refused to attend the
Saturday night meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meretz has said it will not agree to the appointment of
committee headed by Barak to supervise the Shas educational
network.
</P>
<P>
Shas Council of Sages decided on Tuesday that its cabinet
ministers would submit their resignations to Barak during the "next
cabinet meeting" which is scheduled to be held on Sunday, putting
Barak in a coalition dilemma since assuming the office last July.
</P>
<P>
The next few days will be crucial for Barak who has to find ways
to solve this crisis in one way or another.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Airways Earn Less Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Airways (CY), the
national carrier, earned less profit in 1999 than that of 1998, the
local Sunday Mail newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1999 annual report of the Cyprus Airways, the
profit fell from 10 million pounds (16 million dollars) in 1998 to
8.8 million pounds (14.1 million dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
in 1999 the airline had 25.2 percent of incoming and outgoing
air traffic on the island, whereas in 1998 its share was 27.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurocyprian, CY's sister company, also lost ground slightly,
bringing its share of all scheduled and chartered flights down by
3.2 percent to 31.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurocyprian managed a pre-tax profit of 2.2 million Cyprus
pounds (3.5 million U.S. dollars) in 1998, but clocked up only 1.3
million pounds (2.1 million dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The revenue earned from both charter and scheduled passenger
fell by 1.7 percent, from 93.6 million pounds (149.8 million
dollars) in 1998 to 92 million pounds (147.2 million dollars) in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The main factor to the profit margin was the huge hike in
operating costs, from 117.1 million pounds (187.4 million dollars)
in 1998 to 127.4 million pounds (203.9 million dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cy staff costs, the company's biggest outlay, also increased
because of the 3.6 percent rise in the cost of living and a one
percent pay increase.
</P>
<P>
But there were some areas of company growth. Income from freight
and mail increased by 7.6 percent, up to 8.5 million pounds (13.6
million dollars) from a 7.9 million pounds (12.4 million dollars)
in 1998.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanon on Saturday rejected the United Nations' verification
that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) had completely withdrawn from
Lebanon in compliance with Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan confirmed the IDF withdrawal
as having been in full compliance with Security Council Resolution
425. The Security Council met Saturday night to endorse the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The peacefulness of the transition was marred Saturday night,
when a Lebanese man was lightly wounded by an IDF solider firing
warning shots to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, who had
congregated on the Lebanese side by the former Good Fence crossing
point, just north of Metulla.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior figures in Israel's ruling One Israel bloc headed by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak deplored over the weekend the decision of
Education Minister Yossi Sarid to boycott a meeting of ministers
and senior officials Saturday night, which was intended to bring
the long-running crisis of the Shas educational network to an end.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations resumed late Saturday night between the religious
ultra-orthodox Shas and One Israel in the Tel Aviv bureau of
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin. In the meantime, Barak postponed the
weekly cabinet meeting from Sunday to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One Israel has been engaged in tense negotiations with Shas in a
bid to keep Shas within the coalition. Shas decided to bolt the
coalition last week.

biggest member.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), Murshad
said the most important thing in the joint communique and the
talks between Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf

He further said "Indonesia was with Pakistan and not with India
on Kashmir issue."
</P>
<P>
In addition to this, the spokesman said, the talks between the
two countries were held on the important issue of trade and

<HEADLINE> Drought Drives Elephants Into Farms in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The protracted drought has forced
several elephants to invade farms around a village in coastal
Kenya, the Herald newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The invading of the elephants has caused fear and panic, which
 prevented the residents at Mitangani Location of Bamba Division
in Kilifi District from attending their farms, the paper quoted
the area councillor Coun Menza as saying.
</P>
<P>
Menza Saturday urged the Kenya Wildlife Service to come to the
residents' rescue and drive the animals back to the national park,
adding that these wild animals have been terrorizing the residents
since last year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a herdsman in northern Kenya was stoned to
death by monkeys in a scramble for a water hole between his
cattle and the monkeys.
</P>
<P>
The lingering drought has also put 22 million Kenyans, about 80
percent of the country's population, at the verge of starvation.

<HEADLINE> China Deepens Work-Injury Insurance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China is reforming its insurance
system to better protect laborers from on-the-job injuries,
reported China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
An insurance-backed system designed to prevent such injuries
and to care for laborers injured on the job was one of the world's
earliest and most popular social security programs, said Wu Ritu,
director of the medical insurance department of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security, at a seminar organized by the leading
US work-safety insurer, Liberty International.
</P>
<P>
Based on contributions from enterprises, China established its
first workplace injury insurance program in 1995 and has been
improving it since then.
</P>
<P>
Wu said managers will concentrate on adjusting premium rates
and the amount of coverage provided by the insurance to expand its
use.
</P>
<P>
US-based Liberty Mutual Insurance Managing Director of China
Development John Kimber said, "Our emphasis is on the prevention
of occupational diseases and injuries. In the long term, this is
much more cost-effective than providing treatment and
rehabilitation because of injuries or illnesses stemming from
workplace conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said significant investments that have led to improvements
in occupational and environmental health could result in a
reduction in accident rates, thus alleviating huge economic and
social burdens.
</P>
<P>
Although China has established a legal framework for
occupational health and safety, the rapidly developing economy
that creates new job categories each year has made the drafting of
a comprehensive occupational safety law an urgent task, said Shan
Chunchang, director of the State Economic and Trade Commission's
work-safety bureau.
</P>
<P>
The commission submitted a draft of a comprehensive "
occupational safety law" to the State Council at the end of last
year and is pressing for its passage as soon as possible,
according to Shan.
</P>
<P>
It has also stepped up the revision and improvement of existing
rules and regulations concerning occupational safety, Shan said.

<HEADLINE> More Educational Spending for Beijing Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The average expenditure on a child
's education per household in Beijing was 3,860 yuan (465 U.S.
dollars) last year, higher than the average level spent elsewhere
in China, according to the Beijing Municipal Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the higher level of educational spending to
the importance citizens attach to education, the relatively high
income and the high cost of educational expenses in general.
</P>
<P>
The average expenditure of a college student in the Chinese
capital was 9,428 yuan (1,136 U.S. dollars) with tuition and board
costing the most.
</P>
<P>
Parents of primary and senior high school students spend a
great deal of money to allow their children to study playing
musical instruments, painting, computers, sports and science.
Costs for these services are increasing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, parents are willing to pay more for private
instructors.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, children in Beijing are required to
attend a specified school, which is usually located near their
homes. However, some parents want their children to go to other
schools that have higher-quality teachers and better equipment.
Families have to pay a large amount of money to the alternative
schools before a child can be admitted.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Forge Better Trade Ties With Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials believe the eighth
session of the Guangzhou Fair, scheduled for July 26-31, will
provide a good occasion for enterprises from around the country as
well as those from overseas to consider the market potential of
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Fair is an annual event jointly organized by the
municipal government of Guangzhou and the China Foreign Trade
Center (Group).
</P>
<P>
Dai Donghe, director of the fair's organizing committee, was
quoted as saying by today's Business Weekly, 60 provincial or
municipal governments nationwide will send trade delegations to
the fair in search of markets for their products and investors.
</P>
<P>
Participation is high in the event because provinces and cities
have had great successes at the previous fairs.
</P>
<P>
For many of the same reasons, overseas enterprises including
those from the Republic of Korea, as well as Hong Kong and Macao
will display products and seek co-operation opportunities at the
fair.
</P>
<P>
Business transactions valued at 7.41 billion yuan (893 million
U.S. dollars) were made during the previous seven sessions of the
fair. Agreements were signed for 597 projects involving an
investment of 41.46 billion yuan (five billion U.S. dollars)
including foreign capital input of 2.93 billion U.S. dollars,
according to statistics from the organizing committee.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Giant Plans I-mode Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom, an emerging player
in the telecommunications service sector, is planning to introduce
a new mobile Internet service like what Japan's i-mode provides,
reported China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom may imitate Japan-based NTT DoCoMo's i-mode, a
mass-market mobile data service that offers ticket booking
services and other information to mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting feasibility research to see how we can
initiate such a mobile Internet service," said Zhang Fan, director
of the mobile communications department of China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
The company's i-mode proposal came after the narrow-band CDMA
cellular phone system project seemed likely to be called off.
</P>
<P>
The NTT DoCoMo's i-mode is at the center of Japan's high-tech
industry. The company has signed up about six million i-mode
customers since February last year.
</P>
<P>
But, Zhang said that China Unicom may have some difficulties in
duplicating i-mode in China because his company and NTT DoCoMo are
based on different mobile networks.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom aimed to expand the number of its WAP (wireless
application protocol) pilot-project cities from 20 to 50 by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom and China Mobile are both offering WAP service,
which enables mobile phone users to log onto the Internet, on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
"Time is still needed for users to surf the Internet via mobile
phone, given the narrow band-width and lack of content support for
the present," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He added his company will better co-operate with the Internet
content providers to offer quality WAP service.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom, about to go public on the stock markets in New
York and Hong Kong, is expected to announce the final pricing of
its initial public offering (IPO) early this week, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the company's development strategy in the near term
lies in the expansion of GSM mobile network.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom plans to spend 28.9 billion yuan (about 3.48
billion US dollars) on mobile communications this year, expanding
its network capacity by 16.46 million lines. Meanwhile, the number
of mobile phone subscribers with China Unicom will grow by 8.4
million to 13.63 million this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's first goat which was
cloned from adult body cells, died of breathing failure caused by
defects in lung development early this morning after living 36
hours and three minutes.
</P>
<P>
The goat, named "Yuanyuan," was found breathing with difficulty
yesterday when scientists were conducting normal health checkup
for the goat.
</P>
<P>
Scientists concluded that the breathing difficulty of the
cloned goat was caused by abnormal lung development.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Yong from the Northwest University of Science

said the death of "Yuanyuan" is normal, citing the high death rate
of all the cloned animals in the world.

<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China's northernmost province of
Heilongjiang is seeking more opportunities in foreign economic
trade and cooperation, from Russia, in particular, this year, said
Wang Zhenchuan, vice-governor in charge of foreign economic and
trade affairs.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Business Weekly, Wang welcomed foreign
investors during the ongoing 11th China Harbin Economic and Trade
Fair which runs through next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 enterprises from 50 countries and regions have
come to Harbin, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
As one of the seven largest trade fairs in China, the annual
fair has become a significant stage for the province to
demonstrate its capabilities and to learn from others.
</P>
<P>
During the past ten years, more than 40 billion U.S. dollars in
transactions have been completed at the fairs.
</P>
<P>
The province has a 3,040 km borderline with Russia.

<HEADLINE> China's High Steel Prices Begin to Bend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua)-- Prices of steel products on the
Chinese market have begun to dip.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the State Administration of
Metallurgical Industry, the average price of steel products has
declined by seven percent to eight percent, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In coastal Shanghai, China's largest economic powerhouse,
prices of steel products for building materials dropped to about 2,
500 yuan (301 U.S. dollars) per ton from nearly 3,000 yuan (361 U.
S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Prices of steel products have substantially increased since mid-
April thanks to the steel sector's resolute efforts to control
steel output.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of the year, the average price of
steel products increased by 80 yuan (9.6 U.S. dollars) from the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of low-grade steel products exceeded 3,000 yuan per ton
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Exorbitant prices will undermine the sector's efforts to
control output and close down small steel plants and will restrain
demand for steel products.
</P>
<P>
The steel sector plans to slash output by ten percent and shut
down more than 100 small steel plants across the country to
achieve a profit of ten billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The sector's profits slid to 2.5 billion yuan (301 million U.S.
dollars) last year from a record high of 29.4 billion yuan (3.5
billion U.S. dollars) in 1993 because of low prices.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Opposition Lawmakers to Return Parliament  by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- In a significant turn, lawmakers of
the four-party opposition alliance will join the current session
of parliament to retain their membership.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of the opposition alliance made the decision at an
emergency meeting held in the capital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday called upon opposition
leader Begum Khaleda Zia to return to parliament "not only to save
her membership but also to perform her duty to the people who
voted in her favor."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big public meeting at Joypurhat, 280 kilometers
northwest of Dhaka, the prime minister said that she had a report
that the opposition MPs would return to the House only to retain
their membership in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Come to the House and join discussion, let's try to run the
parliament properly," she said.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition continued to boycott parliament sessions,
Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Leader
of the Opposition in Parliament Khaleda Zia and her allies in the
Jatiya Party, Jammat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote (Islami
Solidarity Front) were absent from parliament for more than 60
days as of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As per the constitution if any member of parliament refrained
from attending the House for 90 consecutive days, his or her
membership would automatically be vacated.
</P>
<P>
If the opposition finally goes back to parliament, it will mark
a significant development in the course of politics of the country.
But whether the return will be tactical and what strategy the
opposition adopts is still unclear.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Manna Bhuiyan, secretary general of the BNP, told newsmen
Saturday night that the meeting decided to "foil a play of the
government to get the seats of opposition MPs vacated." "We will
not allow them to implement their design," he said.
</P>
<P>
President of Jatiya Party HM Ershad said that the opposition
would not allow the government to amend the constitution to suit
its purpose by taking advantage of the absence of their MPs from
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big public meeting in the capital, Khaleda Zia
again accused the government for "harassing opposition activists."
</P>
<P>
She claimed that a nationalist government would be formed after
the next general elections as the people will reject the ruling
Awami League (People's League) for its failure and misrule.

<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
recently said the prevention of the gene-based discrimination, the
protection of privacy, the right to information and justice are
all issues of concern to China.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to uphold the principle of the freedom of
science. But, advancements in science must serve, not harm
humankind," Jiang was quoted as saying in the latest issue of the
American magazine "Science" which interviewed the Chinese
president in Beijing in May.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government is now mulling over new
rules and regulations to guide, promote, regulate and guarantee a
healthy development of science. biotechnology, especially gene
research, will bring good to humanity, adding that
telecommunications and nanotechnology advances will have profound,
positive impacts on the future of the society.
</P>
<P>
"We should respect the intellectual property right of others
and know how to protect our own," Jiang said. Carrying out
International collaborations according to the principles of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit will be good to all.
</P>
<P>
As far as the genetic resources are concerned, he said that
China issued in June 1998 the Provisional Rules on the Management
of Human Genetic Resources designed to promote the international
cooperation and exchanges under these principles.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages collaboration between Chinese
scientists and their foreign counterparts in the field, he said,
adding that what is discouraged is nothing but collection of
samples by individuals or companies for commercial purpose in the
name of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Since the provisional rules took effect, collaborations between
Chinese research institutions and their foreign counterparts have
been going on smoothly, Jiang said.

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
during an interview with the American magazine "Science" last
month that the Chinese Government will continue to increase
investment in the basic research and encourage the relevant
agencies to support the basic research.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in the interview, which was carried in the latest
issue of "Science", that China will create a more favorable
research environment for scientists, and encourage scientists to
choose research subjects on their own and research institutes to
institute new mechanisms that suit the law of scientific
development.
</P>
<P>
"The Government will continue to increase investment in the
basic research and encourage the relevant agencies, local
governments, enterprises and the private sector to support and
basic research in various ways," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will engage itself in extensive
international exchanges and cooperation in the basic research.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president stressed the importance of basic research.

<P>
"Looking at the history of science and technology development,
we know that the outcome of the basic research has brought
tremendous breakthroughs and progress for the whole human society
and promoted progress in the applied research, whereas the
continuous advancements in the applied research will inevitably
call for further development in the basic research," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the view of the Chinese president, without the quantum
theory, there would be no microelectronics technology and likewise,
without the relativity theory, there would be no nuclear bombs,
nor would there be any nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes people may not know in what specific areas a
breakthrough in the basic research may be applied, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists who had established quantum theory, for instance,
would not be able to tell or predict how the microelectronics
technology would develop.
</P>
<P>
"So our efforts should be rationally divided between the basic
research, the applied research and the development of technologies,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, one has to consider the level of economic
development and the realities of an individual country. Personally,
I hope that an economically strong country like the United States
will give more input to the basic research," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what fields of scientific research are most
likely to provide high payoffs for China's future well-being,
Jiang said that research results in many new interdisciplinary
areas all may significantly influence China's future well-being.
</P>
<P>
He said that he personally thought that information science,
life science, materials science, and resources and environment
studies will be crucial to China's sustained development in the
future.

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said

</P>
<P>
"I'd like to point out that the added value of information is
reflected by the fact that it is open to all and shared by all,"
he said. "So I hope all young people, both Chinese and foreign,

best use of the Internet and other means of communication."

All countries in the world share concerns on how to protect our

</P>
<P>
The media have been developing very rapidly, and people are now
open to opinions and suggestions from other people of all walks of
life.
</P>
<P>
"One thing must be ensured that facts should not be distorted,"
he stressed. "And I think this should also apply to the Internet.
Otherwise people would ask how to tell truth from distortion on
the Internet?"

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin on Educational Reform and Scientific Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has
recently said that there are many god things in China's
traditional education system, and the basic education in the
country has produced a great number of world-renowned prominent
scientists and engineers who have made important contributions to
the world civilization and progress.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came from the latest issue of the American magazine
"Science" which interviewed President Jiang in Beijing in May.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the accumulation of scientific knowledge should
be encouraged, and of course, it is even more important to
encourage creativity based on predecessors' achievements. We are
reforming the educational system by promoting education for
students of all-round development, combining education with
scientific research and cultivating creative and innovative people.
</P>
<P>
To improve people's overall quality and cultivate talents is a
long-term system engineering, Jiang said, adding that as a Chinese
saying goes, it takes a decade to grow a tree and a century to
cultivate people. China, as a developing country, should keep
improving the scientific literacy of all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, efforts should be made redoubled to publicize
the popular science, encourage people to learn science, love
science and carry forward the spirit of scientific research and
innovation, and advocate scientific methods, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On the other, the nine-year compulsory education should be
promoted in a comprehensive manner. Reform of curricula should be
deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular
activity bases and science museums to enhance the students'
creative capabilities and promote education for students of all-
round development, he said.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin on Policy of Attracting Talents From Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that China is making various measures to create better working and
living conditions, and create a more flexible mechanism to attract
Chinese talents studying abroad to come back.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during an interview with the American
magazine "Science" last month. The contents of the interview were
carried in the latest issue of the magazine on June 16.
</P>
<P>
"Competition in scientific research is competition for talents,
" he said. "The Chinese Government has implemented the policy of
supporting scholars to study abroad, encouraging them to return
and ensuring them the freedom to come and go."
</P>
<P>
Between 1978 and 1999, nearly 320,000 Chinese students and
scholars had gone abroad to study. The number more than doubled
that in more than 100 years from 1872 to 1978 (about 130,000).
Over the past 20 years of reform and opening up, China has
received more than 340,000 students and scholars from 160
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since 1978, about 110,000 of the 320,000
Chinese who have gone abroad to study have been back and played
their due role to the country. He added that it is understandable
that for various reasons, quite a number of them have decided not
to -- at least for the moment -- come back.
</P>
<P>
"The competent departments of the Chinese Government are taking
measures to attract them back, including introducing more
favorable policies and more flexible mechanisms and creating
better working and living conditions for them," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all sorts of technology-or-business-development
parks for returned scholars or students set up by local
governments at all levels have served as incubators for their
scientific and technological development and for turning research
results into products, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that more and more people will come back as our
economy develops and research conditions improve," he said.

ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's external debt is estimated to have
risen to 25.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end of June 2000, the
newspaper Business Recorder reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the annual external debt service payments have
recorded a substantial increase, thereby squeezing the net inflow
of foreign resources. The estimated foreign debt makes 39.4
percent of GDP and about 306 percent of the export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Due to the rescheduling of debt, service payments during 1999-
2000 are expected to decline by 8.5 percent to 1.4 billion dollars
or 2.2 percent of GDP. (Pakistan-Debt)

BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that China would not stop learning from all the fine traditions of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Such learning should not stop "even for a single day," Jiang
told Ellis Rubinstein, editor of U.S. "Science" magazine, in an
interview on May 17, which was published in its latest issue on
June 16.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang said that "the Chinese people have every
reason to be proud about their ancient tradition of civilization."
</P>
<P>
China has carried out international cooperation in the area of
science and technology in line with the principles of equality,
mutual benefit, sharing achievements and respecting intellectual
property rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that international collaborations, including
exchange of scientists, and sharing of resources, information and
research instruments, not only promote the advance of science and
technology, but also propel economic and trade cooperation and
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He cited two Confucius sayings that "Whenever there are three
people walking together, one of them is bound to be able to teach
you something," and "To say you know when you know, and to say you
do not when you do not, that is knowledge."
</P>
<P>
Through international cooperation, the Chinese scientific
community has learned modern theory and management expertise,
upgraded research and development capabilities, improved
engineering and product quality, and produced good economic and
social results, he said, adding that Chinese scientists at the
same time have made their great contributions to modern scientific
progress.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Development of China's Science and Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
that China is implementing a strategy of rejuvenating the country
through science and technology and education in a bid to promote
the construction and development of China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the general-secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the remarks in an
exclusive interview with Ellis Rubinstein, editor of U.S. "Science
" magazine, on May 17. "Science", an internationally recognized
magazine on science and technology, published the interview in its
latest issue of June 16.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that people in China attach great importance to
science and technology. "China has a long history with splendid
achievements in science and technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "Starting from the last years in the Ming Dynasty (
1368-1644), it began to lag behind other countries in terms of
science and technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From Newton's dynamics to Einstein's theory of relativity and
to the latest development of the Internet, science and technology
in the world has developed by leaps and bounds, so I often ask
myself why China began to lag behind after that?" Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the reason lies with the feudal system in
China," he said. "In the Ming Dynasty, the Great Wall was
renovated and strengthened. The feudal rulers forbade traveling
aboard and later imposed restrictions on entry into and exit from
China via sea. That closed the door to external exchanges between
China and the rest of the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Situation changed since the founding of new China,
according to Jiang. The Chinese government always attaches great
importance to the development of science and technology. Now,
China is implementing a strategy of rejuvenating the country
through science and technology and education in a bid to promote
the construction and development of China, he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO-led Kosovo Force Commander Visits Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Huan Ortunjo, commander of the NATO-
led Kosovo Force, visited Macedonia Saturday to discuss matters on
reinforcing security along the border between Macedonia and the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, said reliable sources in the
Macedonian capital of Skoplie.
</P>
<P>
Commander Ortunjo said he has discussed with President Boris
Trajkovski detailed measures to be adopted to effectively put the
border under control, although he did not reveal any details of
the measures.
</P>
<P>
He believed there exists a huge potential for the NATO-led
Kosovo Force and Macedonian border guards to increase their
cooperation in border security.
</P>
<P>
In a letter on June 6 to NATO secretary general George
Robertson, Trajkovski pointed out incidents and illegal crossings
have occurred one after another along the border with Kosovo in
the last few months. He strongly called on the NATO-led Kosovo
Force to adopt necessary measures to reinforce security along the
border.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian government announced last week its border guards
would open fire without prior warning at persons crossing
illegally.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that two Macedonian border guards were wounded
on June 5 by sniper fire from inside Kosovo. It was the second
incident in two months. In early April, a group of Kosovo
Albanians kidnapped four Macedonian border guards, although they
were released later.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Moldova Prepares for Bilateral Fundamental Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Moldova are
accelerating their work for signing a bilateral fundamental treaty
as early as possible, visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin
said in Chisinau Saturday, a report from Moldova's capital city
said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had no difference in principle on signing
such a treaty, stressed Putin, who is there for a 17-hour visit,
the last leg of his European trip.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with his Moldovan
counterpart Petru Luchinschi, Putin said Russia attaches great
importance to its ties with Moldova, considering it a foundation
for Russia's diplomatic activities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The president also promised to take a more active approach on
withdrawing its 2,600 troops from the Russian-speaking region on
the eastern bank of the Dnestr River, which broke away from the
Romanian-speaking Moldova in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Russia will set up a special committee led by former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to solve the problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (
OSCE) conference in Istanbul last autumn, Russia pledged to pull
out all its forces by the end of 2002, but so far little progress
has been made.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Luchinschi said the two sides reached agreements
on the majority of issues in politics and economy at this summit,
while deciding to promote bilateral cooperation in global affairs
and in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped Putin's visit will effectively push forward the
development of Russian-Moldovan relations, which has been hampered
by the Dnestr issue and Chisinau's huge gas debt of 800 million U.
S. dollars to Russia.

GUANGZHOU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 633 smuggled cars

These cars are worth 22.38 million yuan (2.7 million US dollars)

Local officials attribute the increase of car smuggling cases
to two factors. One is the expanding market in China for imported

<P>
In a report circulated in Congress that has yet to be made
public, the General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded that it will
be difficult to know whether the missile shield will function
properly during an attack because of strict limitations on the
Pentagon's ability to test the system of powerful targeting radar,
interceptor missiles and high-speed computers, the newspaper said
in Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
The investigators said the technological uncertainties of the
system greatly increase the prospects for delays, with each month
of delay increasing costs by 124 million U.S. dollars. (US-Missile

But Lebanon on Friday and Saturday rejected the announcement
from Annan that Israel has now complied with a 1978 Security
Council resolution and withdrawn its troops, insisting that
Israeli forces are still on Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
The Council, after hours of meeting, is still debating on a
presidential statement which calls on the Lebanese Government to
ensure the return of its effective authority and to maximize its
presence in the south.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement also welcomes measures taken by the
Secretary-General to beef up the United Nations Peacekeeping force
in Lebanon, and it stresses that U.N. redeployment to the border
shall be carried out in coordination with the redeployment of the
Lebanese armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Council is expected to trim down its original statement on
what U.N. peacekeepers should do about their deployment in Lebanon
until Lebanon accepts the temporary border.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer zone against guerrilla attacks. It announced
its withdrawal on May 24 and U.N. cartographers marked out a
boundary based on maps made in 1923.
</P>
<P>
Annan will visit Lebanon Monday and the Security Council is
under pressure to endorse the Israeli withdrawal immediately.

A spokesman for the company said that hackers compromised AOL
customer service representatives with e-mails containing a "Trojan
horse" attachment, which, when opened, created a connection to the
sender's computer and allowed access to some AOL accounts.
</P>
<P>
Hackers pilfered information such as names, addresses and
credit-card numbers from some subscribers, the company said. But
it declined to disclose the amount of victims, saying only "a very
limited" number of the records of the company's 23 million
subscribers had been accessed.
</P>
<P>
The software virus attack appeared to be similar in kind, but
by no means in scale, to the "ILoeveYou" virus that paralyzed tens
of millions of computers last month, penetrating networks in
government and companies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The attack was deadly, however, said Mark Chen, chief
technology officer at Palo Alto, a California-based Securify
company.
</P>
<P>
"Since once someone gets through the security perimeter, he has
the access to all the powers of a person on the inside," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Holds no Iraqi POWs: DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheikh
Salem al-Sabah Saturday claimed his country holds no Iraqi
prisoners of war (POWs) or political prisoners in its jails.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah, also head of the national committee for Kuwaiti POWs
and missing in action (MIAs), made the remarks in response to
earlier reports that Iraq has formed a committee to search for
Iraqi prisoners in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have any prisoners. Our jails are open before the
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
who pay frequent visits to Kuwaiti jails," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"We held no (Iraqi) political prisoners, either," the Kuwaiti
News Agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated claims by the Kuwaiti government for the return of
the properties looted by Iraqi troops during their invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad accuses Kuwait of failing to provide information about
1,150 Iraqis who went missing during the 1991 Gulf War crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has repeatedly accused Iraq of continuing to hold 605
Kuwaitis and other nationals whom it detained during the seven-
month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner issue has been a major stumbling block in the way
of normalization of Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has sought
assistance from the International Police (Interpol) for the arrest
of a Dar es Salaam businessman suspected to be involved in an over

The Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) Adadi Rajabu told

affecting many financial institutions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The DCI said that Riyaz Gulamani was holding a Tanzanian
passport. Adadi explained that Tanzanian police decided to seek
Interpol's assistance after it had established that Gulamani was
spending a lot of time in Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it was rather difficult to have Gulamani
out of Canada because Tanzania and Canada do not have extradition
protocol in place.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Urges for Communal Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo Saturday urged his countrymen to develop a communal
spirit, irrespective of where they come from and which kind of
belief they have.
</P>
<P>
"All hands must be on deck, and Nigeria should be on the agenda
of public debate, public discourse and public interest. It is the
only way to rebuild and reconstruct Nigeria," said the president
in a nationwide broadcast speech.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people have been killed in various religious
and ethnic clashes since Obasanjo came to office in May 1999,
ending 15 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
The country's three major nationalities, Yoruba, Igbo, and
Hausa have often been seen on a collision cause for more resources
and government positions.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a sense of sacrifice from everyone, of course
some will make more sacrifices than others, it is only then that
we can remove mutual suspicion," Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three days that Obasanjo addressed
the nation after a crippling general strike over gasoline prices
threatened the political fabric of Africa's most populous nation,
which recently celebrated one year of democracy.
</P>
<P>
He also made the speech when the country's northern Kano and
Kaduna states had announced intentions to introduce the Islamic
legal system Sharia in their states again, which if materialized,
is almost certain to giver rise to new riots.
</P>
<P>
Kano and Kaduna are two most popular and influential states in
the northern part of the west African nation. Unlike other
northern states dominated by Muslim population, both of the two
states have a large Christian population.
</P>
<P>
Two northern states, Zamfara and Sokoto, have already
introduced Sharia into their criminal code earlier in the year,
despite the opposition from the Christian dominated southern
states and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Sharia, mainly implemented in Islamic countries, is a code of
living for Muslims. Apart from its religious contents, the code is
known for its regulations that women must cover themselves, and
different sexes must be segregated.

<HEADLINE> England Beats Germany since 1966 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- England, helped by Alan Shearer'
header, edged Germany in its first championship victory over
Germany since the 1966 World Cup final on Saturday in the first
round of the European Championship.
</P>
<P>
With the defeat the defending champion German now is in danger
of going out of the tournament co-hosted in Belgium and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Shearer powered in a far post header from David Beckham's
cross in the 53rd minute to revive England's chances of qualifying
for the quarterfinal and spark celebrations in the stadium in
Charleroi, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The result ended Germany's amazing domination over England in
major championships in the past 34 years. The Germans had knocked
the English out of the 1970 and 1990 World Cups and the 1996 Euros
either in the quarters or the semis and twice after penalty
shootouts.
</P>
<P>
"People back home have waited so long _ so have I _ this is
magnificent," coach Kevin Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
"The character came through. It might carry us a long way
through this tournament if we just believe in ourselves. I'm
delighted for the fans."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Shearer, who came under pressure after not
scoring in his past seven games for England, Keegan said: "He's
answered his critics again. The fans love him but the critics don'
t.''
</P>
<P>
The Germans created plenty of shooting chances but couldn't
get the ball past David Seaman in the England goal. Instead
Michael Owen had a first half header pushed onto the post by
German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn.
</P>
<P>
The victory gives England three points from two games, three
behind Group A winner Portugal. The Germans, who tied with Romania,
has only one and must beat the Portuguese to survive.
</P>
<P>
Veteran German defender Lothar Matthaeus said the Germans paid
the price for not making a breakthrough in the first half.
</P>
<P>
"We could not force our way through in the second half," the
39-year-old said. "England capitalized on its chance, that is the
difference. Now we have to do our utmost to make as much as
possible of our limited chances to go through."
</P>
<P>
The game was played against a background of fan violence
during the buildup and English fans also attacked the police on
their way out of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 English fans were detained and most of them deported
for rioting in downtown Brussels on the eve of the game and in
Charleroi. Police also fired water cannons at English and German
followers who began fighting in Charleroi's main square on the
afternoon of the game.
</P>
<P>
The Germans were forced to face the English without AC Milan
striker Oliver Bierhoff, who suffered a calf muscle injury in
training, while Real Madrid's Steve McManaman and Arsenal captain
Tony Adams were sidelined for England after picking up injuries in
the 3-2 loss to Portugal.

<HEADLINE> 149 Fans Arrested in Charleroi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 17 (Xinhua) -- Riot police clashed with English
and German fans Saturday in the Belgian small town of Charleroi as
tensions rose before the Euro 2000 match between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A total of 149 supporters, mostly English, were arrested by
the time the match began, accroding to reports.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,500 Belgian police were on patrol but they were
unable to prevent mass fighting as the groups of German and
English fans gathered in bars before the match, which England won
1-0.
</P>
<P>
Riot police used water cannon on two separate occasions in an
effort to prevent pitched battles between the fans, who were
massed on opposite sides of the main Charles II square.
</P>
<P>
But immediately after the match, the atmosphere was better-
natured as celebrating England fans sang in fountains in the
centre of Charleroi, but riot police kept a close watch.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 1700 GMT, most of the arrested fans were being
held in cells and 20 were being immediately expelled from Belgium,
the Charleroi mayor Jacques Van Gompel and police chief Michel
Rompen told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of those arrested were found to be in possession of
illegal weapons, Rompen said.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said one English fan would appear before
magistrates next week on charges of striking a police officer.
</P>
<P>
Also being held was the chief of a local group of supporters
known as the "Wallon Boys."
</P>
<P>
A young woman was reported to have broken her leg, apparently
during the police charge in a bid to restore order.
</P>
<P>
The incidents in the afternoon followed similar outbreaks of
violence in Charleroi overnight which left an English fan in
intensive care after suffering cuts to his back.
</P>
<P>
British authorities were struggling Saturday to make
arrangements for the repatriation from Belgium of hundreds of fans
after a computer glitch brought air traffic to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian authorities were trying to fly back 343 fans
arrested on Friday during trouble in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Called for to Bolster Ethiopian-Eritrean Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
said here Sunday that U.N. peacekeeping forces should be
immediately deployed in an effort to bolster a peace deal signed on
Sunday between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The concerned parties should try to implement the peace
agreement quickly, Annan said of the accord that the two countries
clinched in Algiers, capital of Algeria, earlier to end their two-
year border war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived here Sunday during a multi-leg Middle
East tour. He told a news conference after meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa that the U.N. Security Council would
decide on a request for peacekeepers contained in the deal brokered
by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been asked to send peacekeepers to the border area
of Ethiopia and Eritrea as well as to demarcate the border, he
said, adding that on this issue, both sides have reportedly agreed
to respect the U.N. demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed hope that U.N. member states will be willing and
prepared to provide troops and resources necessary for the task.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal calls for an immediate truce and the deployment
of U.N. peacekeeping forces in a 25-kilometer buffer zone in
Eritrea until the border between the two countries is demarcated.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been engaged in a border dispute since
May 6, l998 when the Eritrean troops invaded and seized some
Ethiopian territories. Fighting renewed last May along their 1,000-
kilometer border, with Ethiopian troops marching into Eritrea,
beyond disputed border regions which were at the root of the border
war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa welcomed the ceasefire accord as an "important
step" towards making peace between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt is confident that the agreement would bring peace,
stability and security to the Horn of Africa, protect the two
African peoples and open the door to socio-economic development.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges Majlis to Address Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Sunday urged the Majlis (parliament) to pass
legislations on resolving economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis is expected to give priority to easing the economic
hardships and working to remove poverty in the society, Khamenei
said in a meeting with members of the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
The supreme authority of the islamic republic, staying above
factional rifts, seemed trying to persuade the victorious
reformists to focus on economic issues, rather than on political
struggle with the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The sixth parliament should pay attention to the economic
difficulties of the people, fight corruption, misuse of public
fund, and discrimination, and remove administrative and judicial
shortcomings, Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
High inflation and unemployment are the two major economic
problems facing Iran.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament, dominated by allies of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, started work on May 27. It approved a motion on
Sunday to ease the press law to resume banned newspaper and release
jailed journalists.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen reformist papers and journals were closed and a number
of reformist journalists and activists imprisoned in the fierce
struggle between the reformists and conservatives during the
parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
The reformists came out the winner in the elections. But as they
won their seats mainly on slogans of promoting political and
cultural freedoms, they seem not ready to address economic
problems.

<HEADLINE> Bashar Appointed Leader of Syria's Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Bashar al-Assad, the son of the
late Syrian president Hafez al-Assad, on Sunday was appointed
leader of Syria's ruling Baath party which is holding its ninth
congress.
</P>
<P>
Bashar is expected to be elected secretary-general of the party
at the end of the congress, which is due to end Wednesday, the
official SANA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Observers said it is almost certain that the 1,021 delegates
attending the congress are to give approval to Bashar's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, 34, is already commander-in-chief of the armed forces
and sole candidate from the ruling party for presidency after his
father died of a heart attack on June 10.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian parliament is due to meet June 25 to endorse the
appointment and a referendum will follow on the appointment.
</P>
<P>
To name Bashar secretary general, to elect new leaders to its
ruling council and to steer Syria toward modernization are issue
high on the agenda of the ruling party's congress which opened
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The last national congress of Baath party was held 15 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Pays Tribute to Outgoing PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Sunday named prominent legislator Ali Abu Ragheb as prime
minister to succeed Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, but commended the latter
for his 15 months of service as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb is expected to be sworn in as prime minister before the
king in the coming days, most probably on Monday, informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Rawabdeh, King Abdullah praised him and his
cabinet members for working diligently and faithfully for the
country in the face of challenges and offering the country a lot of
accomplishments to be remembered with gratitude and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Rawabdeh, in his letter of resignation, attributed
achievements of his government to the leadership of the 38-year-old
king, and praised the king for a "first, biggest and most important
role in all what has been accomplished in a relatively short period
of time".
</P>
<P>
The kingdom is expected to achieve a 3 percent economic growth
in 2000 after a 1.5 percent growth in 1999, apparently emerging
from a decade-old recession since the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh was the first prime minister appointed in March 1999 by
King Abdullah who acceded to the throne a month earlier after his
father King Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The monarch has the constitutional power to appoint or dismiss
governments.
</P>
<P>
The decision by Abdullah to appoint Ragheb, 54, as the new prime
minister was apparently aimed at speeding up economic reforms based
on understandings with the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund and other major international creditors, and to forge a more
harmonious relationship between the government and the legislature.
Rawabdeh, though known as conservative, had taken liberal measures
to reduce the deficits in state budgets, to pravitize key but non-
profitable state enterprises and to reduce public expenditures and
to attract more foreign investors into the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
But he was also attacked by liberals and conservatives alike for
alleged nepotism in appointments to senior jobs and for abuses of
public funds. He was also attacked by a rumor that his son had
asked for millions of U.S. dollars from potential investors.
</P>
<P>
He had been at odds with the parliament, particularly with the
80-member lower house, and failed to win support from the house for
some of his reforms partly due to a lack of personal charisma.
</P>
<P>
Ragheb, a parliamentarian since 1993 and two-time minister of
industry and trade, is expected to inherit and accelerate
Rawabdeh's reform packages, but possibly with more blessings from
the parliament given his background in the house.
</P>
<P>
He is heading the financial and economic affairs committee of
the house before being appointed prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Endorses Israeli Withdrawal From Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18(Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Sunday endorsed the conclusion by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan that Israel had withdrawn its forces from
southern Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
The move came after two-day debate among the 15-member Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan reported to the Security Council Friday that Israel had
completely withdrawn its forces from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council welcomed the
steps already taken by the parties concerned to implement the
recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's report of May
22, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council calls on all parties to continue to
cooperate fully with the United Nations and the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon(UNIFIL) and to exercise utmost restraint.
</P>
<P>
The Council reemphasized the need for strict respect for the
territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of
Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the Government of Lebanese to ensure the
return of its effective authority and presence in the south and to
proceed with the deployment of the Lebanese armed forces as soon
as possible, with the assistance of UNIFIL, into the Lebanese
territory recently vacated by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed that the redeployment of UNIFIL should be
conducted in coordination with the Government of Lebanon and with
the Lebanese armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Council looked forward to the completion of the mandate of
UNIFIL and will review by July 31, 2000, the need to extend the
present mandate of UNIFIL, taking into account the report of the
Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 425 of 1978
and 426 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer zone against guerrilla attacks. It announced
it withdrew on May 24 and U.N. cartographers marked out a
boundary based on 1923 maps.

UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Sunday endorsed the conclusion by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan that Israel had withdrawn its forces from
southern Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425 of 1978.
</P>
<P>
The move came after two days of Marathon negotiations among the
15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement which was read in an open, formal
meeting by Council President for the current month, Jean-David
Levitte of France, the Security Council also acknowledged that
there may have been some violations of the border, a move seen
widely here as an apparent bid to ease Russia's concern.
</P>

parties concerned to implement the recommendations contained in
the Secretary-General's report of May 22, 2000.

announced it had withdrawn on May 24 and U.N. cartographers marked

</P>
<P>
Russia delayed the Council's endorsement since Saturday
because Lebanon insisted that Israeli forces were still on Lebanon
's soil.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was under great pressure today to endorse
the Israeli withdrawal. According to U.N. diplomats here, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is scheduled to visit Lebanon
Monday, had threatened to cancel his trip if the Security Council
did not support his position.
</P>
<P>
Annan informed the Security Council Friday that Israel had
completely withdrawn all its forces from southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> British Airport Flights Gradually Return to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Flights at most UK airports were
gradually returning to normal on Sunday, as airlines fought with
the congestion caused by the collapse of the main air traffic
control computer.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of travellers were left stranded on Saturday, with
some forced to sleep overnight at airports.
</P>
<P>
The problem with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS)
computer, which handles all aircraft entering UK airspace, was
fixed by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the backlog means that flight delays look likely to
continue for the rest of the day, although cancellations are down
to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The busy airports of Heathrow and Gatwick have been hardest hit.
British Airways had to cancel 18 Sunday morning flights to
domestic and European destinations from Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
This followed more than 80 cancellations on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Terminal manager at London's Gatwick Airport, Anthony Merlyn,
said no flights had been cancelled but most passengers could still
expect a delay of three to four hours as the backlog is cleared.
</P>
<P>
Manchester airport was also struggling to get back to normal
after the technical problems.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the airport said: "Passengers flying
transatlantic have not been affected but flights which crossed
Heathrow airspace were badly delayed yesterday."
</P>
<P>
The airports in Belfast and Glasgow were also affected.
</P>
<P>
NATS has promised a "thorough investigation" into the computer
breakdown, the second time the system has failed in a week.
</P>
<P>
The problem meant that flight course information, normally
passed electronically, had to be retrieved by hand.
</P>
<P>
The computer which failed should provide controllers with the
call sign of an aircraft, where it came from and its destination.
However, after it went down controllers still had radar and radio
control of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
All major British airports were affected as the controllers
were forced for the second time this month to resort to a manual
system to give instructions to planes in the air.
</P>
<P>
Engineers managed to bring the computer back on line by early
afternoon on Saturday, but after a breakdown lasting more than
five hours the congestion built up with planes badly delayed or
diverted from their destinations.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Occur During Orange Order Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's police and army in
Northern Ireland came under attack from nationalist rioters
protesting at an Orange Order Parade in Lurgan in County Armagh on
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Police said about 30 petrol bombs, as well as ball bearings and
golf balls were thrown at the security forces, the BBC reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three police officers and one soldier were slightly injured in
the violence and one man was arrested.
</P>
<P>
Police said three people were hit by baton rounds during the
clashes which lasted for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein said the Northern Ireland Parades Commission's
decision to allow the march, into what it claimed was a
nationalist area, had been "sheer folly."
</P>
<P>
It said the commission must take the blame for what happened.
</P>
<P>
A number of houses were damaged by missiles thrown during the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Violence broke out in the William Street area of the town
despite large numbers of troops and police in riot gear at
flashpoint areas.
</P>
<P>
An police spokesman said an estimated 25-30 petrol bombs had
been thrown at security forces and police fired three plastic
bullets at rioters during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in several years a parade had been
allowed into the area, and although trouble flared, it did not
involve any of those taking part in the march.

LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
Sunday ordered an inquiry into how the names of 140,000 young
offenders were accidentally wiped from the central police database.
</P>
<P>
The blunder means those with cautions would no longer appear on
the police computer, although the Home Office says sentencing won'
t be affected.
</P>
<P>
There is no effect on conviction records or registered sex
offender records
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokesman said that records of cautions against
the juveniles were deleted by mistake when the database was being
amended by an individual sorting through the lists.
</P>
<P>
It was feared that the error could have implications for
sentencing, with people appearing to have clean records.
</P>
<P>
But a Home Office spokesman insisted that there was a hard copy
of all the records and that there would be no effect on sentencing.

about the speed of U.S. plans to deploy a national missile defense
(NMD) system by 2005, including doubts whether interceptors can
yet distinguish between armed warheads and decoys, The Washington
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The report was given to Defense Secretary William Cohen last
week by an independent panel headed by retired General Larry Welch,
former Air Force chief of staff, the newspaper said in Sunday
editions.
</P>
<P>
It questioned the current maturity of the technology, raising
concerns about the problem of dummy decoys launched with attacking
missiles, and about pressure from the U.S. Congress for fast-track
2005 deployment of a yet-unproved system.
</P>
<P>
Decoys are designed to fool defensive projectiles attempting to
shoot down nuclear or other warheads approaching the target.
</P>
<P>
The Post said that the report from the panel pointed to
problems over whether the system could distinguish between real
attacking missiles and decoys in space and concern that the
timetable for constructing a working system in five years is
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
The panel, which serves independently under Defense Secretary
William Cohen, had extensive access to secret information. The
panel, which also includes experts from industry and retired
senior military officers had been giving lengthy briefings on its
conclusions to Pentagon officials, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military is scheduled to attempt for a third time in
early July to shoot down a dummy warhead high over the Pacific
Ocean with a test "hit-to-kill" weapon fired from a Pacific atoll.
</P>
<P>
The first such test last October was successful, although
there was a problem with finding the approaching warhead. A second
such test failed early this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to decide this year whether to break ground
next spring to start building a powerful radar station in Alaska
State in the first phase of an NMD shield to be operational by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.
