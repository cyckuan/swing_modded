<HEADLINE> UN: More European Immigrants Needed  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With anti-foreigner sentiment running high
in parts of Europe, a new U.N. study suggests that more immigrants
-- not fewer -- are needed to keep Europe competitive and able to
care for its rapidly aging population.
</P>
<P>
   The study, being released Tuesday by the U.N. Population
Division, also notes that Japan and South Korea are facing
significant population declines over the next 50 years and that
migration would offset the economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   The report could have serious implications for governments
grappling with the increasingly vocal immigration debate but also
facing the prospect of supporting their surging number of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Since fertility rates in Japan, South Korea and Europe -- among
the lowest in the world already -- aren't expected to increase
dramatically over the next few decades, the report suggests that
migration may be the best and only realistic answer.
</P>
<P>
   The report examines demographics in eight countries -- France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, South Korea, Britain and the United
States -- and two regions: Europe and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Among other scenarios, it looks at what level of migration would
be required to maintain the ratio of the working-age population to
the retired-age population. That statistic helps weigh how workers
are able to care for retirees, who require more services such as
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Japan would need about 10 million
immigrants every year for the next 50 years to maintain the current
working-age to retirement-age ratio. Without migration, figures
show it would be necessary to raise the retirement age to about 77
to maintain the ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Italy would also need to raise the working-age limit to 77 if it
doesn't accept the 2.2 million migrants a year needed to maintain
the ratio of four working people for every retiree, the report
found.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Demeny, a scholar at the Population Council and the editor
of its quarterly, Population and Development Review, said the U.N.
report was an ''illustrative exercise'' that should stimulate
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Demeny questioned the report's presumption that a declining
population was necessarily bad, noting that ''Europe's best years --
most creative and scientific'' in the 18th century occurred when
the population was considerably smaller than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing sacrosanct in the present situation that
would mandate that the present situation has to be frozen from here
to eternity or from here to 2050,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that fertility rates could suddenly increase --
as they did in the post-World War II baby-boom years in the United
States -- which would help correct the declining population.
</P>
<P>
   ''These affluent societies -- Europe, Japan, North America -- have
plenty of economic potential to adjust to these relatively
slow-moving changes without courting disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report makes no specific recommendations, but merely
concludes that the demographic changes in store in the next 50
years will require a thorough reassessment of ''many established
economic, social and political policies and programs.''

<HEADLINE> Rudolph Task Force To Disband  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. (AP) -- The task force that has hunted serial
bombing suspect Eric Rudolph for two years will dismantle its
command post in the rugged Southern Appalachians by the end of
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eric Rudolph has not escaped justice, he has just delayed
it,'' Steven McCraw, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, said
Monday. ''The trail is cold, yet all evidence suggests he's here,
he's alone and he's alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings,
including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998, explosion
that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that
performs abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Birmingham bombing, a truck seen near the
explosion site was traced to Rudolph. Rudolph rented a video in
Murphy, N.C., that night, bought a large cache of food and supplies
and vanished. His truck was found near here several days later.
</P>
<P>
   But dogs, searchers and infrared-equipped helicopters have
failed to find Rudolph, an Army veteran and survivalist, in the
dense mountain forests. Agents stopped actively searching in the
woods in August, after McCraw took the job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCraw said in his first public appearance since then that he's
leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C.
Agents will remain in Andrews, and a local coordinator will report
to FBI officials in Atlanta, McCraw said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been just one confirmed sighting of Rudolph since his
disappearance, in July 1998. McCraw said Rudolph may have been
involved in a February 1999 break-in at a restaurant, but the
perpetrator did not leave any fingerprints or other forensic
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to
his arrest, but some people in the area have said they believe
Rudolph may have gotten help from sympathetic locals. Others say he
might have left the region.

<HEADLINE> Baseball, Umps Reach Interim Deal  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The new union of baseball umpires agreed Monday
to eliminate separate American and National league staffs as part
of an interim agreement with the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, umpires agreed not to strike through June 14, and
owners agreed not to lock them out through the same date.
</P>
<P>
   The new union, the World Umpires Association, was certified by
the National Labor Relations Board on Feb. 24 and replaced Richie
Phillips' Major League Umpires Association.
</P>
<P>
   The MLUA's collective bargaining agreement with the AL and NL
expired Dec. 31, and the terms of those agreement disappeared when
the new union was certified.
</P>
<P>
   Under the interim agreement, which remains in effect until a new
collective bargaining agreement is reached, the sides agreed that
the pay scales in the next deal will be retroactive to the start of
this season. Also, no strike or lockout can start without 14 days
prior notice, and neither side can give notice until June 14 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Owners agreed to recognize the new union as the umpires'
collective bargaining agent, and umpires agreed to recognize the
commissioner's office as their employer. Baseball, in term, agreed
to give the new union a dues checkoff.
</P>
<P>
   NL umpires, who controlled the MLUA, had fought baseball's plan
to centralize the umpiring staffs, one of the reasons of the failed
mass resignation plan last summer that cost 22 umpires their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While the new union, led primarily by AL umpires, negotiates the
collective bargaining agreement, the old union remains in charge of
the grievance attempting to get the 22 umps their jobs back.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 3, Avalanche 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Brent Sopel and Harold Druken scored third-period
goals as the Vancouver Canucks defeated the Colorado Avalanche for
the first time in nine meetings winning 3-2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bertuzzi added his fourth goal in four games for the
Canucks, 0-6-2 in their previous eight meetings with Colorado.
Vancouver last beat the Avalanche on Dec. 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Druken tied the game early in the first with his fifth goal.
Sopel, called up Feb. 19, provided the game-winner at 7:10 of the
third with his first goal this season.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Potvin stopped 36 shots as the Canucks moved within two
points of San Jose for the eighth and final playoff spot in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic got his 11th goal in 10 games for the Avalanche. Milan
Hejduk had a goal as Colorado remained two points ahead of idle
Edmonton for first place in the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic gave Colorado took a 1-0 lead at 5:21 of the first with
his 23rd goal. Bertuzzi answered at 9:39 of the period with his
20th.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic's goal came after he picked off an errant pass by Sopel
inside the Vancouver zone, fed Chris Drury, who returned the puck
in front of the crease for a tap-in goal. Brendon Morrison found
Bertuzzi in stride behind Avalanche defenseman Greg de Vries and
Bertuzzi skated in alone on Patrick Roy and beat him with a
backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Hejduk broke the tie one minute into the second period with his
31st goal. Drury tapped the puck to Hejduk along the boards and he
skated into the slot unchecked and fired a shot over Potvin's
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver had its chances, the best two by Brad May with seven
minutes left in the period. Roy stopped a wrap-around attempt by
May and a second shot from point blank.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks needed 31 seconds to tie it at 2-2 in the third
period. Druken stripped the puck from Peter Forsberg behind the net
and skated in front past two Avalanche defensemen and beat Roy with
a backhander.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Pederson set up Sopel with a pass from behind the net.
Sopel beat Roy shortside from the right circle at 7:10 for his
second career goal.

<HEADLINE> Doctors test telemedicine capabilities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- It's a nostalgic notion with a
21st-century twist -- high-tech house calls.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate Medical University in Syracuse and Columbia University
in New York City are taking part in a $28 million study to
determine whether it can be beneficial and affordable to deliver
health care through the Internet into the homes of 750 rural and
inner-city diabetes patients over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, telemedicine could provide greater access to
health care for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up front, obviously, telemedicine is going to cost more than
normal care,'' said Dr. Ruth Weinstock, director of the Joslin
Center for Diabetes at Upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to compare that to the cost of renal failure, and
going on dialysis, or the cost of having a stroke, or going
blind,'' she said. ''We hope it's obvious that telemedicine is
better in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The grant from the Health Care Financing Administration is the
largest telemedicine effort the federal government has ever funded.
The project provides free-of-cost personal computer with
Windows-based programming, telephone-line Internet access and
health monitoring equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The study will recruit 1,500 patients from northern Manhattan
and parts of upstate, including Syracuse, Elmira, Watertown and
Olean.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the participants will receive the computers and
diagnostic equipment. The other half will continue with only the
usual care from their doctors. The project includes a control group
so doctors can compare health care costs and benefits between the
two groups, Weinstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Telemedicine offers two advantages for patients. They will have
access to comprehensive information from an expanded American
Diabetes Association Web site and limitless chances to receive
treatment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the winter comes, and the snow comes, often the patients
cannot see their health care providers as often as would be
optimal,'' Weinstock said. ''This way, if their blood sugar is very
high, we can see that as soon as it happens, and make adjustments.
They can get 'visits' as often as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   If the project demonstrates a cost reduction and improved care,
telemedicine should become much more common, said Dr. Paul Knudson,
a diabetes specialist at the Joslin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with computers will have use of a blood-sugar
monitoring device, an automatic blood pressure cuff and a camera
hooked up to the computer. The camera will allow doctors to look at
patients' skin lesions without requiring patients to leave their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall project results will begin coming within a year, said
Dr. Steven Shea, a Columbia University medical professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether or not we can do it ... and it is acceptable to the
patient, we'll know that within a year,'' Shea said. ''Whether it
improves the patients' care with daily management or their diet,
blood sugar level, blood pressure, and exercise, we will not know
that for two to three years.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving training, patients will check their blood sugar,
blood pressure and other factors and enter the data into a secure
Web site for analysis by doctors at Upstate. Patients will receive
information through their computers on how to manage their disease.
If a patient's data falls outside of an acceptable range, an
automatic alert will be sent via the Internet to a doctor or nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is a good choice to start studying telemedicine because
of the constant attention and treatment it requires, Weinstock
said. In New York alone, nearly 1 million people over the age of 40
suffer from diabetes. It is estimated that the federal government
could save more than $250 million yearly in health care costs
through early intervention in diabetes treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be used as a model to develop more effective
treatments for other diseases, such as depression, obesity, asthma
and heart failure.

<HEADLINE> SUNY chancellor getting $90,000 housing allowance for staying athome  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State University of New York Chancellor
Robert King has turned down living in the SUNY-provided
chancellor's residence and is getting paid an extra $90,000 a year
for staying in his Albany-area home instead of living in, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   The previously unrevealed housing allowance is in addition to
his $250,000-a-year salary that SUNY officials announced in
December when King was hired.
</P>
<P>
   The salary and housing allowance added together mean that King,
who has no previous academic experience, received a 130 percent
raise when he left his job as Gov. George Pataki's state budget
director to lead SUNY.
</P>
<P>
   King is a close friend of the governor and the two have known
each other since King joined the state Assembly in 1987. Pataki had
arrived in the Assembly two years earlier. As head of Pataki's
budget office, King was known as a fiscal hawk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why you would need a housing allowance if you
have a taxpayer supported residence and are largely based in
Albany,'' said Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest
Research Group, who cautioned that his group had not done a
comparison of similar university systems. ''I don't know what the
justification is.''
</P>
<P>
   King was in Chicago on Monday at an education conference and not
available for comment, SUNY spokesman E.J. McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is clearly outrageous that salary (supplement) was
not revealed,'' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is he has no experience in the field,'' the
Assembly Democrat told Albany's WROW-AM radio. ''I don't know why
we have to pay top dollar to someone at this point who may be
learning on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   King isn't the only state official not using his official
residence in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki only rarely stays at the Executive Mansion, preferring to
stay most nights at his posh Victorian home in Garrison, Putnam
County. The governor does not get an extra housing allowance,
Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki controls the SUNY system through his appointments to the
SUNY Board of Trustees. The trustees selected King as chancellor
and approved the housing supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The state education commissioner used to have an official
residence in Albany but it was sold in 1995, officials said.
Education Commissioner Richard Mills does not get a housing
allowance, spokesman Thomas Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   During their search for a chancellor, SUNY officials were told
by their search consultant, Korn/Ferry International, that the
chancellor's residence -- a penthouse suite in SUNY's baronial
central headquarters in downtown Albany -- probably would not be
suitable for a candidate with a family, McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   King, who is married and has children, has a house in Clifton
Park. He told SUNY officials he didn't want to live in the
chancellor's residence, McMahon added.
</P>
<P>
   He said King plans on using the housing allowance to buy a new
house closer to his office at SUNY central.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post first reported the SUNY housing allowance in
its Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY had not revealed the housing allowance previously, McMahon
said, because it wasn't in the resolution that the SUNY trustees
approved for King's hiring and no one asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody was deliberately trying to hide the compensation,'' the
SUNY spokesman said. ''It simply wasn't revealed ... but it wasn't
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   King's predecessor, John Ryan, also was paid $250,000 a year by
SUNY and lived in the chancellor's residence. He did not get the
housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old King, as budget director, made $147,490 a year.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said that in setting up the supplement for King, SUNY
officials were influenced in part by the fact that City University
of New York Chancellor Matthew Goldstein -- who had been hired in
July -- got a $250,000-a-year salary and a $90,000-a-year housing
allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the thoughts that went into the size of the housing
allowance for our chancellor was the size of the housing allowance
for the CUNY chancellor,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to be competitive with academic peer institutions,
and first and foremost, right under their nose, is CUNY,'' McMahon
said. ''And CUNY's got that package.''
</P>
<P>
   There are differences between the SUNY and CUNY situations. CUNY
no longer had an official residence available when Goldstein took
the job. Also, housing costs are considerably less in the Albany
area than in New York City where CUNY is located.
</P>
<P>
   Without a chancellor in residence, the SUNY residence will be
used for visiting dignitaries and official university activities
like luncheons, McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and King are the two highest paid state employees,
even without the housing allowances, according to records
maintained by the state comptroller's office.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani, under fire on guns, favors licensing ''dangerousweapons''  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, under attack from
Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton for taking money from gun
interests, says he favors a sweeping licensing system for firearm
owners.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-day campaign trip over the weekend, the New York
City mayor drew applause for his proposal in a largely conservative
area of the state.
</P>
<P>
   At a community forum in Watertown in northern New York, one
resident reminded the Republican mayor that many people in the
region firmly believe in a constitutional right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not think the government should cut off the right to bear
arms,'' Giuliani responded. Nonetheless, the mayor said his
position for many years has been that just as a motorist must have
a license, gun owners should be required to have one as well.
</P>
<P>
   According to a tape recording of the meeting supplied by
Giuliani campaign aides, the mayor said that anyone wanting to own
a gun should ''have to pass a written exam that shows they know how
to use the gun, that they're intelligent enough and responsible
enough to handle a gun.'' He got applause from those at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt both handguns and rifle owners should be
licensed, Giuliani said, ''We're talking about all dangerous
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has called for a licensing system for handgun
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said he supports Gov. George Pataki's gun-control
proposals unveiled last week. The Pataki plan would require
ballistic records on all handguns sold in New York and mandatory
trigger locks for them. Pataki would also raise the legal gun
purchase age to 21, up from 18, and require instant background
checks on purchasers at gun shows and flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's gun-control statements in Jefferson County came just
hours before the Clinton campaign attacked him for taking $1,000
from Bushmaster Firearms, a contribution that was listed by the
Giuliani Senate campaign as coming from the head of ''Bushmaster
Farms.'' The mayor said he didn't know anything about the
contribution or the person who gave the money.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also came under fire from Clinton for taking a $1,000
contribution from Charlton Heston, the actor who is president of
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the NRA has increased in recent days after the
group's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said during a
March 12 television appearance that President Clinton was ''willing
to accept a certain level of killing to further his political
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment Monday from the NRA to Giuliani's licensing
position.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's camp continued its criticism of the mayor on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He ought to break with Charlton Heston and his friends in the
gun-industry,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor's record on gun control is one of the strongest in
the country,'' Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum
responded. ''New York City has extremely strong gun-control laws
and the mayor's position on that is well established. Once again,
it's the difference between a record and rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani aide said ''the mayor's visit to Watertown
illustrates perhaps one of the greatest distinctions between him
and Mrs. Clinton -- the mayor doesn't pander.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Shares Rebound From Plunge  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Share prices rallied Tuesday, led by gains
in Taiwan's big computer chipmakers as worries about a war with
China subsided and the market bounced back from an early drop.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks jumped almost 5.5 percent, with investors sensing
bargains after a sell-off Monday pushed the Taipei market 2.6
percent lower following the presidential election win by an
opposition party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Government funds intervened by purchasing shares -- which lifted
sentiment at the same time street protests against the leadership
of the defeated Nationalist Party were dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Prices dropped 2.1 percent in the first few minutes of trading
but quickly rebounded into a powerful rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Weighted Price Index closed with a gain of 468.43 points at
9,004.48.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan dollar edged higher against the U.S. dollar,
reversing recent declines.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about panic-selling, Finance Minister Paul Chiu has
imposed an emergency decree limiting any share falls to 3.5 percent
over the next two weeks, half the normal daily limit of 7 percent.
Chiu did not change the 7 percent limit for price rises, however.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was led by Taiwan's two biggest high-tech companies --
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., up 6 percent, and United
Microelectronics Corp., up 6.8 percent. Their shares account for
about a fifth of the value on the Taipei market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold heavily on Monday, with two-thirds of the listed
companies in Taiwan falling as far as they could.
</P>
<P>
   But some companies did well Monday on perceptions that
President-elect Chen Shui-bian will boost economic ties with
mainland China rather than push Taiwan into a war with its bigger
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping concerns rose, after Chen said he wants to establish
air and sea links with China -- which would save time and money for
Taiwanese companies that do business there but now must send people
and goods through another point, often Hong Kong, because of
Taiwan's ban on direct travel to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Amid Taiwan's political upheaval, protesters turned out in force
-- clashing violently with police Sunday and Monday -- as they
demanded that President Lee Teng-hui step down as chairman of the
Nationalist Party to accept blame for its candidate's loss in the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of diehards still protesting Tuesday were peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Lee agreed to quit the top party post, but not until September.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's election stirred fears of conflict with China, which
claims Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited with the
mainland at some point, even though the two have been governed
separately since the Chinese communists won a civil war on the
mainland in 1949. Chen's party favors independence, which China
says would lead to war, though Chen himself has backed off that
stance.

<HEADLINE> EU Waking Up to e-trade Sweepstakes  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Slowly, the European Union is waking up
to the multibillion-dollar e-trade sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Lagging behind the United States in many new technology sectors
-- from e-commerce to Internet applications -- Europe does hold a
coveted trump: it leads in the mobile telephone industryand hopes
that will pay off handsomely in the burgeoning wireless Internet
market.
</P>
<P>
   To reach such potential, Europe is busy catching the e-buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians are exhorting businesses to get aboard the
e-commerce bandwagon, essentially the electronic vending of
anything -- shoes, stocks, vacations, pension plans, mortgages, you
name it.
</P>
<P>
   E-businesses want politicians to cut tax and labor red tape so
they can keep up with those free market Americans, who already own
20 percent of Europe's e-trade market through such companies as
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   To help close the gap, the 15 European heads of government will
convene Thursday for a two-day summit in Lisbon, Portugal, to
discuss how to better embrace information technology, which
analysts say promises jobs by the millions and solid economic
growth over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Europe is not yet realizing the full potential of the
Internet,'' says Erkki Liikanen, the EU information society
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is wide. Enter 100 European homes and you will find that
88 are not hooked to the Internet. In the United States, roughly
half of all homes are online.
</P>
<P>
   In a pre-summit letter, summit host and Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres, told his colleagues, ''Europe is lagging
behind significantly (but) we have the conditions to define a new
strategic goal for the next 10 years: to make the European Union
the world's most dynamic and competitive economic area.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, the EU will need to build on the strengths
highlighted by its Seville, Spain,-based Institute for Prospective
Technological Studies, which found Europe to be strong in the
mobile telephone industry, consumer electronics and on-board
computing for autos.
</P>
<P>
   The new technologies require new skills, new jobs and changes in
social legislation that promise tough choices. Some EU nations
cling to cushy social security systems that make for unresponsive
labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, joblessness ranges from just about nothing in the
Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg to double-digit unemployment in
France and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The labor markets will need to be increasingly streamlined.
</P>
<P>
   And, the European Commission says, governments must do more to
give tax breaks and other incentives to Internet and other
companies that foster greater use of new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also says Europeans must become much more
Internet-savvy -- and recommends that all schools be online by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Lisbon summit will address these and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle is an aging population. By 2010, workers in Western
Europe in the 55-65 age group will outnumber those aged between 16
and 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The Seville institute's report makes clear, however, it is
swim-or-sink time if Europe is to keep up with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge. By 2010, half of all EU jobs will be in
industries that either produce or use information technology,
according to EU Employment Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou.
</P>
<P>
   But today, she says, ''Net access is not only much lower than in
the United States, it is concentrated among higher income groups,
among men, and in northern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is in the air, though. Dot-com companies are making
inroads in the EU, and some are already reaping a bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our greatest expectations have been met and exceeded,'' said
Jean Zurstrassen of VMS-Keytrade.com, a Belgian online broker that
went public in December. ''And this is only the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Zurstrassen's company had 4,500 clients at the start of 2000. He
expects 15,000 by year-end. Compared to the traditional industries,
e-business moves lightning fast in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''One year in e-commerce means about seven years in the rest of
the economy,'' said Peter Ploegaerts, business manager of Azur, a
year-old Belgian online shopping company that is taking on such
American goliaths as Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the business-to-business, or B2B, side of global
e-trade was worth an estimated $145 billion, with Europe accounting
for 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The independent information technology research firm Gartner
Group sees Europe's B2B e-trade -- which cuts production, inventory,
distribution and procurement costs -- reaching $2.3 trillion by
2004, or a third of worldwide e-business.
</P>
<P>
   The information industry's labor shortage is already acute,
however. Germany and Britain -- two EU nations that have progressed
furthest down the e-highway -- are lacking 60,000 and 20,000
e-workers respectively.

<HEADLINE> Bloomsburg mourns three dead fraternity brothers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Two of the three people killed in a
weekend fire at Bloomsburg University were from New Jersey,
according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania authorities have not released the identities of two
of the three victims. But The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in
Tuesday's editions that the third victim has been identified as
Kristoffer Polhemus, a former star wrestler from Hunterdon County.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning Sunday blaze also killed Cliff Vail of
Dunellen, and Marcus LaBuda, of Hazelton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Polhemus, 21, of Hampton Borough, a 1995 graduate of Voorhees
High School, was remembered Monday as a ''jokester'' and ''a sweet
kid'' who had an outgoing personality.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Dotzman, a senior from Bensalem, Pa., was sitting
outside her sorority house when a friend drove up and gave her a
hug. Both girls sobbed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Vail and Polhemus, who became inseparable friends, had lived
next door to the sorority house two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were always borrowing stuff,'' Dotzman said. ''And we
borrowed stuff from them. Then we just started hanging out all the
time. We became really good friends. They treated me like I was
their sister.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hampton, Polhemus was remembered as both a star athlete and
polite young man. One family friend described him as ''just a sweet
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Very polite, the kid that every parent would say, 'I'm glad my
son has a friend like that,''' said Pat Tuma, whose son, Brian, was
a good friend of Polhemus.
</P>
<P>
   At Voorhees High School, Polhemus, who won two district
wrestling championships and also pitched for the baseball team, was
known for his friendly personality.
</P>
<P>
   His baseball coach, Chip Clymer, said he would tell a joke even
when the team was losing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was the team clown, a jokester,'' Clymer said. ''He was
liked by everybody on and off the team.''
</P>
<P>
   One classmate at Bloomsburg remembered how Vail helped her
through a particularly tough problem in her financial accounting
class. Kelly Marshall, a senior from Hazleton, Pa., who was also
friends with LaBuda, said Vail ''went over the problem again and
again and again. There's not many people who would have taken the
time to do that. He was so caring.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire was the second fatal blaze at the campus in six years.
A 1994 blaze killed five fraternity brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never, ever imagine you'll go through it once,'' said Jim
Hollister, the fraternity's adviser and university spokesman. ''A
second time is truly unbelievable. Who could ever imagine it? Who
could ever?''
</P>
<P>
   Two other TKE brothers, Kevin Murphy of Norristown and Dave
Pulieri of Bethlehem, and TKE alumnus Jamie Dezzi of Philadelphia,
escaped the blaze unharmed. Two had to leap off a second-story
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Vail's principal at Dunellen High School, Donald Burkhardt, told
The Star-Ledger, ''He would light up a room when he walked into it.
He was a real well-liked, well-respected kid. The whole town is
gong to be shaken by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail played football, basketball and baseball although he was
just 5-feet-7 and 140 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He played big,'' football coach Jeff Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cliffsy was just a wonderful kid -- a wonderful kid all
around,'' said Pio Pennisi, the assistant high school principal and
former head football coach. ''I can't sit here and say he broke all
kinds of records. All I can say is I would take 11 of him on a
field any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students, many of them wearing sweatshirts adorned
with their Greek letters, packed the campus auditorium Monday
morning to hear details of the fire from university president
Jessica Kozloff.
</P>
<P>
   As she solemnly announced LaBuda's death, dozens of students in
the front gasped and whimpered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This university,'' Kozloff declared, ''is in mourning. There
are simply no words to express our sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire started several hours after the end of a party attended
by about 30 students.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 fire led to a few changes. Bloomsburg required the
fraternities to pass an annual code inspection to keep their
university recognition. The city got a second code enforcement
officer. Student government donated thousands of dollars to the
local fire department.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fire came only a few months after the TKE brothers
corrected several code violations. They had an empty fire
extinguisher, a smoke detector without a battery and an outlet
overloaded by five heaters.
</P>
<P>
   By January, all of those violations had been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators worked, knots of students made their way down
the hill from campus to leave flowers on the curb. Sorority sisters
left notes and candles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Around 6 o'clock I got a phone call yesterday morning, and I
drove over to the house. To see a fire that large, it was just
scary,'' said Greg Bowden, an Alpha Chi Rho brother.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, many students gathered around a flag pole on the edge
of campus to watch as Bowden set the flag at half-staff. Classes
were then canceled for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, what a sight,'' Kozloff said with a deep sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Larry McNeil sat in the driver's seat of a police
cruiser, using the megaphone to say a prayer for the dead brothers.
Later, he comforted a group of tearful women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just telling them that ultimately, the heart of Greek
life is that we exist for each other, that we're brothers and
sisters,'' McNeil said. ''We lean on each other.''

<HEADLINE> Disagreement on Future of Economy  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CUNNIFF, AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- While nothing seems to daunt investors, some of
the companies they invest in may be seeing things a bit
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers, the base of the Old Economy sector which seems to
have undergone a resurrection in recent days, are not totally
convinced that Wall Street is viewing the same future they are.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as the National Association of Manufacturers puts it,
such companies ''are adopting a largely defensive stance despite
the rosy economic picture.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say they are pessimistic. Just, perhaps,
realistic. A survey of 2,500 members shows they anticipate stable
''but significantly slower'' economic growth in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted before Wall Street rediscovered
old-line stocks last week, but its findings still indicate serious
reservations and concerns about many bullish forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey supports sentiments often expressed by the National
Association of Manufacturers that interest rates are already high
and that further tightening of monetary policy would
''disproportionately'' damage manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Business, whose 600,000
members range from proprietorships to companies with more than a
billion dollars in sales, is equally restrained about prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, economist William Dunkelberg, who conducts regular
surveys of member sentiment, reports sharply lower expectations
about the general business climate and their own sales volume.
</P>
<P>
   They're not saying the bottom is going to fall out, says
Dunkelberg, ''but they're inclined to think we've topped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the latest survey, he said, members expect a weakening
over the next six months. Seasonally adjusted, companies expecting
an improved economy fell sharply to its lowest level in nearly a
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, there seems to remain a contradiction between what
members of both organizations say and what they do.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Association of Manufacturers, for
example, continue with plans to expand internationally, with nearly
a quarter expecting at least a 6 percent increase in exports. And
they continue to hire and, in fact, complain about a lack of
skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the National Federation of Independent Business also
express concern about a lack of skilled workers; nearly one-third
complained in the latest survey about difficulty in filling job
openings. And rather than reducing capital spending plans and
inventories, they've been raising them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither organization foresees an economic bust, nor anything
approaching it. And it's understandable that each complains about
the added business costs associated with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the difference between business attitudes and those of
the people who invest in business, is worth considering, because
the reality is likely to be found somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   And what is strongly suggested is that: 1. the economic
expansion isn't going into reverse, and 2. it isn't going to meet
some of the more optimistic expectations of investors.

<HEADLINE> Former Black Panther Said Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A former Black Panther leader wanted in
the fatal shooting of an Atlanta sheriff's deputy was captured in
Alabama Monday after he was spotted in a rural shed by federal
marshals, began firing at them and fled, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, once known as H. Rap Brown, was arrested
in Alabama's Lowndes County, west of Montgomery, FBI agent Theodore
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities used tracking dogs and a helicopter as they closed
in on him, Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said at a
late-night news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was scheduled to make a court appearance in Montgomery
on Tuesday and expected to be returned to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Al-Amin was spotted about 6:30 p.m. and was
arrested about three hours later in Autaugaville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin was seen peering out from a shed, and he immediately
began firing shots at the team of U.S. marshals who found him,
Jackson said. He ran from the shed into nearby woods with marshals
chasing him. Jackson said shots were fired on several occasions
during the pursuit. He said federal and state agents circled him,
then released dogs into the area. Within moments, Al-Amin was
arrested, uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is accused of fatally shooting deputy Ricky Kinchen
and wounding deputy Aldranon English in a shootout in Atlanta
Thursday night. Montgomery is about 160 miles southwest of Atlanta.
The deputies were trying to serve Al-Amin arrest warrant at his
store.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant was issued after Al-Amin failed to appear in court
in January on charges of theft by receiving stolen property and
impersonating an officer. Those charges stemmed from an incident
last May, in which Al-Amin was allegedly stopped in a stolen car
and flashed a badge.
</P>
<P>
   They did not know he was the former Black Panther militant known
as H. Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   As the deputies approached a black Mercedes-Benz, the driver got
out and started shooting a high-powered assault rifle. English
identified the shooter as Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of national Islamic groups had urged the ex-Black
Panther to turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s Al-Amin served as a leader of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and justice minister of the
Black Panthers. He once exhorted blacks to arm themselves, saying,
''Violence is as American as cherry pie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he was charged with inciting a riot in Cambridge, Md.,
where he had told about 400 blacks: ''It's time for Cambridge to
explode, baby. Black folks built America, and if America don't come
around, we're going to burn America down.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, shots were fired between blacks and whites.
Al-Amin was wounded in the forehead by a shotgun pellet, and a
white police officer was shot in the neck, face and hand. No one
was killed. The next morning, a school and two city blocks burned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he was accused of aggravated assault after a man
claimed he was shot by Al-Amin. The man later recanted and said he
was pressured by authorities to identify Al-Amin as the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin went to Atlanta in 1976 after converting to Islam while
serving five years in prison for his role in a robbery that ended
in a shootout with New York police. In recent years, he has been
the spiritual leader of a mosque and operated a small grocery in
Atlanta's West End.

<HEADLINE> 36 Sikhs Killed in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Gunmen rounded up and killed 36 Sikh
villagers in India's disputed Kashmir state, police said Tuesday,
even as President Clinton was beginning a visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's massacre was the first major attack on Kashmir's
small Sikh community since separatist Muslims launched their
insurgency 10 years ago. Sikhs are considered a neutral minority,
but Indian officials earlier had warned of violence by Muslim
militants hoping to draw attention to Kashmir during Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan claim the Himalayan territory and have
fought two wars over it.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were not immediately identified and no group claimed
responsibility for the attack, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton -- who arrived Monday evening in New Delhi, 400 miles to
the south, after a visit to Bangladesh -- had said that reducing
tensions between India and Pakistan was one of his objectives of
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kashmiris were hoping the president's visit would lead to a
breakthrough in the long deadlock on the region's future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart expressed outrage over the
killings, saying in a statement that ''our most profound sympathies
go out to the victims of this brutal massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   The attackers entered the village of Chati Singhpura Mattan
after dark and forced the residents from their homes, police
officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They separated the men from the women, announcing that they were
conducting a ''crackdown.'' Indian security forces operate
similarly when searching a neighborhood for militants they suspect
may be hiding there.
</P>
<P>
   Then the gunmen opened fire on the men, killing 34 of them and
wounding four. Two later died in hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They brought out the males from their homes and shot them at
point-blank range,'' said A.K. Bhan, the director general of
police. He said the attackers spoke Urdu, the language common in
both Kashmir and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Army troops began searching the hills and forests near the
village, about 42 miles from Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital.
</P>
<P>
   Sikhs have lived mostly undisturbed in the Kashmir Valley, the
only area in predominantly Hindu India with a Muslim majority. Many
run the trucking companies that supply the valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, attacks by the militants have focused on
army bases and patrols rather than random terrorism, and have shown
a higher degree of training and expertise, senior army officers
told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   They said about 3,500 militants were in Kashmir, and many of
them had infiltrated the cease-fire line from Pakistan, with the
help of the Pakistan army. Pakistan denies giving active aid to the
militants.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the Sikh village is controlled by armed Kashmiri
groups which abandoned separatism and were recruited by the Indian
army as a counterinsurgency auxiliary force.

<HEADLINE> Latest police shooting draws scrutiny to drug operations  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Undercover police efforts to arrest people who
buy or sell drugs on the streets have come under scrutiny following
the death of Patrick Dorismond, the fourth unarmed black man
fatally shot by cops in the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   The newest such initiative, Operation Condor, has netted 21,445
arrests since it began on Jan. 17, according to police statistics
released Monday. Condor's goal: to stem the slight increase in
crime that occurred last year, after a decade in which murder,
robberies and other violent crimes plummeted to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   Although the undercover detectives who approached Dorismond
outside a Manhattan bar asking for drugs and then shot him were not
part of Condor, their aggressive tactics have prompted community
leaders and a black officers' group to question all undercover
narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond said ''no'' when one of the undercovers asked if he
knew where the officer could buy marijuana. But the cop persisted,
angering Dorismond, which led to a fight that ended with the
26-year-old man shot once in the chest by Detective Anthony Vasquez
on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the first black man in history who died for saying, 'Just
say no to drugs,''' said Lt. Eric Adams, a frequent critic of the
police department and head of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir has defended Condor and other
drug initiatives. The commissioner, who was not at work Monday, has
repeatedly said that drugs have a great deal to do with crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eighty percent of crime -- I believe in this country -- has a
nexus to drug trafficking,'' Safir said in an interview with The
Associated Press last year. ''If you significantly impact on drug
trafficking, then you reduce violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A host of experts on anti-drug efforts disagree. Joseph
McNamara, a former New York Police Department deputy inspector and
former police chief in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose, Calif., said
undercover initiatives are highly confrontational and dangerous and
don't work.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get all of this police violence without any of the
promised results of less drugs,'' said McNamara, a research fellow
at Stanford University's Hoover Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive tactics have hurt police credibility in minority
neighborhoods, where most drug arrests occur, he added. NYPD
officials did not provide racial breakdowns of drug arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Small, director of public policy and community outreach
at The Lindesmith Center, said undercover initiatives create an
atmosphere of an accident waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the police are actually doing is not sitting around and
watching for people selling or buying drugs -- they are actually
approaching people, initiating contact,'' said Small, whose New
York City-based research institute focuses on drug policy and
related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy
Foundation in Washington, D.C., said buy-and-bust operations have
not significantly reduced drug trafficking in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's fair to say when you arrest a street-level drug
seller, you create a job opening,'' said Sterling. ''You're not
shutting down an enterprise. You're not stopping crime from being
committed in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara called for an end to the so-called war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police chiefs across the country have voted on prevention,
treatment and education to focus on that,'' he said. ''We know that
treatment can be effective, and it's better to stop people from
using drugs than incarcerating them without any prevention
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Safir has remained committed to tough enforcement. The NYPD
has budgeted $24.3 million through June for overtime costs
associated with Operation Condor. The initiative puts 520 extra
plainclothes narcotics cops on the streets daily.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 19, those officers had worked 325,601 hours of
overtime on Condor, which stands for Citywide Organized Narcotics
Drug Operational Response. The majority of arrests made through the
program, 65 percent, have been for misdemeanor offenses, police
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   However, violent crime is up slightly in the city, including the
homicide rate, which had fallen to record lows in the 1990s. As of
Sunday, there have been 173 homicides in the city in 2000, compared
with 141 during the same period last year, a 22.6 percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Judge declares mistrial in arson murder case  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- The state must decide whether to put a
Branford business owner on trial for a third time on charges he set
a fire that burned down his store and killed a firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The second trial of Anthony ''Gene'' Bontatibus ended in a
mistrial Monday after a juror admitted he asked about the
flammability of vinyl flooring at a store over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Michael Dearington said he would talk to the
relatives of firefighter Edward Ramos, 36, to see if they wanted to
go through another trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we have become friends over the past three years, I
think I would be somewhat deferential to their feelings,''
Dearington said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos' brother Gary, said he would not let the case drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I'm just going to say that we will be back,''
Gary Ramos said. ''Whatever we do, we want to find justice for
Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Bontatibus, 60, is charged with arson murder and three counts of
arson in the fire on Thanksgiving Day 1996 that killed Ramos, 36. A
trial in July 1998 ended in a hung jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking for a favorable verdict,'' said Bontatibus'
lawyer, Thomas Ullmann. ''He's upset that it ended this way. The
Bontatibus family was hopeful this nightmare would end.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had argued that Bontatibus poured flammable liquid
on the floor of his business and set it on fire for $124,000 in
insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   An expert for the state testified that burn patterns on the
vinyl tile on the floor showed that the fire was set.
</P>
<P>
   Experts for the defense said the fire could have started from a
persistent natural gas leak or electrical problems at Bontatibus'
Floors and More. Bontatibus testified in his own defense and denied
setting the fire.
</P>
<P>
   With jurors about evenly divided over whether the fire was
arson, one juror, Victor Pacheco, told the judge he went shopping
for kitchen flooring over the weekend and asked the salesperson
about the flammability of vinyl tile.
</P>
<P>
   Such outside investigation is forbidden in trials. Jurors are
required to rely only on the information presented in court.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco started to tell his fellow jurors what he found out when
other jurors told him to stop. They reported the incident to the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Bruce W. Thompson said he had ''absolutely
no alternative'' but to declare a mistrial since the jury was
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow jurors said they were disappointed or angry about the
mistrial, but some said they doubted if the jury would have reached
a verdict anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not clear to make a decision one way or another. We
were in the course of sorting things out. It was not easy,'' said
Mark Fawzy, 59, of New Haven, a director of Swiss Bank in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Friedberg, an English literature professor at Wesleyan
University, said some jurors seemed psychologically unable to
convict, as if they feared the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed because in my opinion, Gene Bontatibus is
getting away with murder, and I'm particularly distressed that four
weeks of concentrated effort on the part of the entire court, not
simply the jury, was wiped out in a stroke,'' Friedberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Carmine Bracale of Hamden, 34, an employee of SNET, said
he favored acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel there was enough evidence. The evidence was
well-presented, but it didn't cover every possibility,'' Bracale
said. ''Before you send a guy away for the rest of his life, you
have to look at all their options.''
</P>
<P>
   Bontatibus is scheduled to be back in court May 2.

<HEADLINE> State's plan to cut back on rush hour hassles has slowed down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Department of Transportation
says businesses are not doing enough to help cut down on rush hour
traffic in lower Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $60 million plan to improve mass transit in the area,
the department has reached just 18 percent of its total goal of
removing 8,600 vehicles from the highways.
</P>
<P>
   DOT officials say they are confident that the goals will be met,
but they also say the business community has not helped change the
commuting behavior of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The major reduction in rush-hour traffic under the plan would
come from people changing their behavior -- working from home,
working flexible hours or carpooling with co-workers, among other
ideas,'' said Harry Harris, the DOT's public transportation bureau
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Governor John. G. Rowland rode the train from Fairfield to the
South Norwalk train station in March 1998 to announce a $58.4
million plan to alleviate regional traffic congestion. The plan
earmarks $57 million to add parking and make improvements at train
stations and uses $1.4 million to survey commuters and begin a
marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has not started and the state has been unable to
acquire sites for new train station parking.
</P>
<P>
   And members of the council overseeing the DOT's progress have
complained that the plan is not comprehensive enough to meet the
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I'm saying here is, 'Where's the beef?' '' said Karyl Lee
Hall, who has been the council's most vocal critic of the
department. ''I applaud their effort, but it's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   According to DOT estimates, 1,504 vehicles have been removed
from Interstate 95, Route 1 and the Merritt and Wilbur Cross
parkways over the plan's first two years. That's 1,200 fewer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   However, DOT officials said earlier this month that counting
cars -- the plan's measurement of success -- may be flawed. If
traffic is moving slower, they said, fewer vehicles pass highway
counters in a given time period, incorrectly indicating that there
aren't as many cars on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to bureaucracy as a problem in making progress to
cut traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT has taken almost a year to hire a firm to conduct a
survey of commuters, which would be used to base several strategic
and marketing decisions throughout the five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland called for a 7-cent cut in the state's gasoline tax and
a 15 percent increase in bus fares, which has drawn fire from some
key legislators who question whether he remains committed to the
plan he took credit for two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand people questioning that,'' said state House
Speaker Moira Lyons, D-Stamford. ''The facts, all those pieces,
don't indicate an individual who understands how critical the
problem of congestion is down here, or how crucial it is to move
people to new forms of transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said that is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm never satisfied with the progress, and we're going to
continue to work with DOT to respond to traffic conditions there,
ranging from building new parking spaces, trying to affect rider
behavior and getting more people to ride the trains,'' Rowland said
last month. ''It's going to take a little bit of time, but I'll
continue to push DOT and any other interested parties to make it
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Andy Heck Returns to Redskins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Offensive tackle Andy Heck signed a
three-year contract with the Washington Redskins on Monday, even
though he may be demoted from starter to backup next season.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.3 million deal, which includes a $250,000 signing bonus,
is structured so Heck probably actually will only play one season,
The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, 33, started all 16 games last season, but started to wear
down late in the year before tearing a hamstring in the playoff
game against Detroit. He missed the playoff loss at Tampa the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   He is being brought back as an insurance policy. The Redskins
have the second and third overall picks in the April draft, and
they are considering selecting Alabama tackle Chris Samuels --
especially if Cleveland chooses one of the two available Penn State
defensive standouts, LaVar Arrington or Courtney Brown.
</P>
<P>
   If the Redskins choose Samuels, Heck will serve as his veteran
mentor. Otherwise, the team will sign a veteran free agent tackle
to compete with Heck for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Heck was a first-round draft pick for Seattle in 1989. He played
with the Seahawks from 1989-93 and with the Chicago Bears from
1994-98.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 105, Clippers 93  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mitch Richmond scored 13 of his 21 points in
the third quarter and Washington's reserves outscored the Clippers'
61-24 Monday night as the Wizards beat Los Angeles 105-93 for their
third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Juwan Howard added 18 points for the Wizards, who have beaten
the Clippers five straight times in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby scored 20 points and Derek Anderson had 18 for the
Clippers, who lost for the 36th time in 41 games. Starting point
guard Lamar Odom was in street clothes because of a strained right
calf, missing a game for the third time this season.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 19 points on Howard's slam dunk with 6:55 left
in the third quarter, the Clippers trimmed the deficit to 70-60
with an 11-2 spurt capped by Eric Piatkowski's 16-footer, a
3-pointer by Pete Chilcutt and a layup by Nesby with 3:58 left in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles got as close as 78-70 on a dunk by Charles Jones
with 25 seconds left in the third, but then shot themselves out of
it by missing 10 of their first 13 field goal attempts in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards put it away with a pair of free throws by Chris
Whitney, a 3-pointer by Tracy Murray and a dunk by Howard in a 1:15
span, extending their lead to 101-84 with 3:16 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards led this matchup of last-place teams 55-39 at
halftime without any of their players scoring in double figures.
Their bench outscored Clippers reserves Keith Closs, Pete Chilcutt
and Jeff McInnis by a 38-2 margin. Jones didn't play in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles failed to make a basket during a 6:14 span of the
second quarter, while Whitney's pair of 3-pointers helped fuel a
17-0 run that turned a three-point deficit into a 45-31 lead with
4:24 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Clippers have had at least one player sit out because
of injury or illness in 56 of their 68 games this season. It's just
as well. When everyone is healthy, their record is only 1-11. The
lone victory was a 102-90 decision over Vancouver at Staples
Center. ... Despite squandering all of a game-opening 8-0 run, Los
Angeles led 25-24 after one quarter. It was the seventh time in 10
games that the Clippers took a lead into the second period, but
their record in those seven games is 1-6. ... The Wizards, who
haven't won four consecutive games since the last four games of the
1997-98 season, will attempt to match that figure on Tuesday night
at Sacramento in Mitch Richmond's first game at Arco Arena since
leaving the Kings. ... The Wizards snapped a nine-game road losing
streak against Pacific Division teams. ... The Wizards are 11-18
since Michael Jordan took over as president of basketball
operations.

<HEADLINE> Activists call for federal intervention in wake of Dorismondshooting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Community leaders and politicians have stepped
up demands for federal oversight of the New York Police Department
in the wake of the police shooting of an unarmed Brooklyn man.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton met for more than an hour with
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, head of an ongoing
investigation into whether the police department fosters abuse of
minorities through lax discipline of officers who use excessive
force.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton emerged from the closed-door meeting saying he had
urged Lynch to impose a federal monitor in brutality cases. Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, took a similar position in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''In view of the danger to which all New Yorkers are exposed in
the absence of new management policies and training procedures, we
are left with no recourse but to appeal for federal action,''
Rangel wrote in a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lynch declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at City Hall, the city's top lawyer defended Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's release of Patrick Dorismond's criminal record,
including a sealed juvenile offense.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, a security guard, was fatally shot in a scuffle
with an undercover officer outside a Manhattan bar last week.
Police and the officer's attorney have said Dorismond tried to grab
the undercover officer's gun after the officer asked him if he knew
where to buy marijuana as part of a police drug buy-and-bust
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton repeated charges that Giuliani and police Commissioner
Howard Safir had poisoned the local inquiry by making public
Dorismond's criminal record. Calling Lynch noncommittal, he said he
would organize protesters for a large-scale march on Manhattan's
Federal Plaza next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole nation is watching New York,'' Sharpton said.
''We're certainly going to let them understand that we will not be
a city run by people who would dig up in the middle of the night
people's juvenile records to try to justify'' the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at City Hall, corporation counsel Michael
Hess defended Giuliani's much-criticized public discussion of
Dorismond's juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a violation of law in any way,'' Hess said. ''The
policy of confidentiality is to allow a person who's committed an
act at a young age to rehabilitate themselves. ... When someone
dies, that right to privacy is eliminated. ... In this particular
situation, when the decedent passed away, his right to privacy ...
died with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess added that Giuliani was just trying to make sure the
information available about Dorismond's shooting was balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt to have an even-handed approach to the
public, to let the public know about the police officer and about
the decedent, and it was an attempt to balance out the
information,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton -- noting the recent acquittal in Albany of four
officers in the fatal shooting of another unarmed man, Amadou
Diallo -- also dismissed assurances by Manhattan District attorney
Robert Morganthau that his office would fully investigate the
shooting and present its findings to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to see what happened in Albany happen again
with a state bogus prosecution,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Brooklyn, seven Haitian organizations held a news
conference to rally behind Dorismond's family and protest the
release of his rap sheet, which comprised three misdemeanor cases,
none resulting in a jail sentence. Dorismond's parents are Haitian
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand with the Dorismond family, we grieve with the
Dorismond family, we are angry with the Dorismond family,'' said
Vladimir Rodney, vice chairman and spokesman for the groups, known
as the Haitian American Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   He announced a community day of mourning on Saturday, when
Dorismond will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Among speakers at the news conference in a Brooklyn church was
Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who was the victim of a brutal
sodomy attack in a police precinct house in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Two former police officers face long prison terms for violating
his civil rights. One of those officers plus two others were
convicted two weeks ago of a conspiracy to conceal details of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought after what happened to me there would not be any
more police brutality again,'' Louima said. ''But it seems like
it's getting worse. That makes me feel like my suffering was in
vain.''

<HEADLINE> Suns 110, Celtics 106  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Clifford Robinson made six free throws in the
final 1:46, helping the Phoenix Suns cut off Boston's attempts to
rally in a 110-106 victory over the Celtics on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson finished with 22 points and nine rebounds as the Suns
moved within one game of clinching a playoff berth with their
fourth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd had 16 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds, and
Shawn Marion scored 18 points. Rodney Rogers added 17 and Penny
Hardaway 13 in the balanced Suns attack.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce scored 27 points for the Celtics, who were stymied
in their attempt to win three road games in a row for the first
time since December 1995. Antoine Walker added 23 points and 14
rebounds for Boston, which had its three-game winning streak
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd scored Phoenix's last field goal with 4:05 to play, driving
to the baseline for a 10-foot jumper that bounced around the rim
and finally dropped through. He was fouled and made the free throw
for a 104-92 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson tried to rally the Celtics, making a layup,
tipping in his own missed shot and passing to Walker for a dunk in
a 1:05 spurt that got Boston within 104-98 with 2:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   After that, every inbounds pass went to Robinson, and he went to
the line four times. The Celtics could get no closer than the final
margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns led just 84-83 starting the fourth quarter after the
Celtics put on an 11-5 surge in the last 2:13 of the third, but
Robinson, who had 11 points in the final quarter, made two quick
field goals as the Suns opened a 91-86 lead in the first 2:02.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led throughout the first quarter, but that changed
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Bailey had two three-point plays during a 24-6 run by the
Suns in the first 5:46 of the second quarter that carried them to a
52-36 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce had 10 points as Boston responded with a 16-5 run of its
own, but Rogers and Hardaway hit 3-pointers to give Phoenix a 62-52
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Suns went 15-0 at home against the East this year,
their first sweep of visiting Eastern Conference teams in the Suns'
32-year history. ... The Suns are 27-5 when reaching triple digits,
and Celtics are 6-26 when that an opponent gets there. ... The
Celtics are 0-7 on the road against the Pacific Division. ... The
game was the first in six in which Walker failed to score at least
25 points.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Test Delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next test of the National Missile Defense
system has been postponed until late June, a Pentagon official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the delay, it is uncertain whether President Clinton
will still be in office to make the deployment decision, and
whether the system can be completed by the target date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials will announce the delay at a news conference
Tuesday, spokesman Lt Col. Lane Vandesteeg said. The test,
originally scheduled for April 27, will be held on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen had planned to review the
readiness of the missile defense project in June. On the basis of
that review, Cohen would have recommended to the president whether
to move ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned by the Pentagon, the system would use a network of
radars and silo-based interceptor missiles to detect, track and
shoot down long-range ballistic missiles outside Earth's
atmosphere. Congress has required the administration to deploy such
a system as soon as technology allows.
</P>
<P>
   So far two tests have been staged of the system's ability to
intercept a target missile in space. The first, last fall,
succeeded. The second, in January, failed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to postpone the test was first reported in Tuesday
editions of The washington Post.

<HEADLINE> Pope Tours Holy Land  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- On the first day of his long-awaited
spiritual tour of the Holy Land, Pope John Paul II received warm
receptions from both Christians and Muslims in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop -- Israel -- might be a bit more tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   The frail 79-year-old pope will greet thousands of the faithful
at a Mass in Jordan's capital today, the second day of his weeklong
Holy Land pilgrimage, before heading on to neighboring Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He will be welcomed by Israel's president and prime minister -- a
sharp contrast to the last papal visit in 1964, when Pope Paul VI
and Israeli leaders pointedly kept their distance and the pope
avoided saying the country's name in public.
</P>
<P>
   The pope wants his trip to be a spiritual celebration that
promotes harmony among Christians, Jews and Muslims. But some
Israelis and Palestinians see the pilgrimage as a forum to press
their claims for control of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has stressed that the pontiff has no political
agenda, though John Paul acknowledged the region's political
turmoil shortly after touching down Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this area of the world, there are grave and urgent issues
of justice, of the rights of peoples and nations which have to be
resolved,'' he said at the Amman airport. ''No matter how
difficult, no matter how long, the process of seeking peace must
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Jordanian ceremonies have been relatively low-key
since the pope arrived Monday afternoon, Israel is planning its
biggest security operation ever.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, police on Monday ordered Palestinians to remove a
huge balloon tethered to Orient House, the PLO headquarters in the
eastern part of the city. ''Jerusalem, the eternal Palestinian
capital, welcomes His Holiness, the Pope,'' the balloon read.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, police said suspected right-wing Jewish
extremists vandalized the helipad where the papal helicopter is to
land, spray-painting swastikas and slogans such as ''Pope Out.''
Mainstream Jewish leaders welcome the pope's visit and his
statements promoting reconciliation among faiths, but they would
like him to go further in acknowledging the church's past
discrimination against Jews and its public silence during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is scheduled to start his day today with a morning Mass
that is expected to draw tens of thousands to an Amman sports
stadium. Next, he heads for the east bank of the Jordan River that,
according to some religious scholars and archaeologists, is the
site of Jesus' baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The claim has sparked a friendly cross-border rivalry with
Israel, which has long maintained that Jesus was baptized on the
western side of the river, now under Israeli military control. In
the interest of fair play, John Paul will be traveling to the
Israeli site later in the week. The Vatican has not taken a
position on either side's claim, and the dispute may have as much
to do with tourism revenue as religious scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's first stop in Jordan on Monday was at a site holy to
the three religions, Mount Nebo. Tradition holds that the prophet
Moses first saw the Promised Land from the hilltop after wandering
for 40 years in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The pope stood for five minutes, peering at the Dead Sea,
Jericho and the hills of Jerusalem through the afternoon haze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our gaze directed toward Jerusalem, let us lift up our prayers
to Almighty God, for all the people living in the land of promise,
Jews, Muslims, Christians,'' he said. ''Bestow upon all who live
here the gift of true peace, justice, fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope slurred his words and his left hand shook as he gripped
his silver staff -- symptoms of Parkinson's, a progressive
neurological disorder.
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived from Rome earlier, the pope was welcomed in Jordan
by King Abdullah II along with Christian and Muslim clerics. The
pope no longer kisses the ground upon arrival, though he made the
sign of the cross after receiving a pot of Jordanian soil from a
Muslim boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your visit, your holiness, brings the hope for a brighter
future to those who have known nothing but the miseries of the
past,'' King Abdullah told the pontiff. ''Hope for the Palestinians
who yearn for justice and stability. A promise for the Israelis of
security and acceptance. Comfort for the Lebanese of a better
tomorrow. And the hope for the Syrians that the sad chapter of war
is finally over.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Communist's Future Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Gennady Zyuganov heads Russia's largest political
party with millions of ardent followers and decades of hard nosed
experience. Which is why he's been written off in Sunday's crucial
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: Zyuganov is the candidate of the Communist Party,
which is losing its direction as Russians grow more accustomed to
the freedoms -- and headaches -- of capitalism and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are the party of my grandfather. The Communists have no
future,'' said Marina Davydova, 33, a soft-spoken graduate student
watching Zyuganov sign autographs during a campaign tour of the
industrial city of Chelyabinsk. ''I almost pity them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the Soviet system collapsed, most Russians
revile or ridicule the Communist Party. Those who do support it are
mostly past retirement age, and many are ill and dying.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' ranks are fracturing as its leadership casts
about for ways to survive: reaching out to youth, striking deals
with political foes, moderating hard-line rhetoric. None of it
seems to be helping.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov is expected to come in second in Sunday's vote, behind
acting President Vladimir Putin -- way, way behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential elections, Zyuganov came so close to
victory that Davydova urged her friends to vote for Boris Yeltsin.
She considered Yeltsin a power-hungry alcoholic, but the threat of
renewed Soviet-era repressions under Zyuganov terrified her.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Communist threat appears to be losing its teeth.
''We've come too far to go back,'' said Davydova. She's not sure if
she will vote at all this time.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment was echoed throughout Zyuganov's tour of
Chelyabinsk. Workers in the Ural Mountains region's factories and
nuclear research centers rallied behind Zyuganov in 1996, but
support this year has been lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zyuganov knows he will not win, and this is probably his last
chance at coming close,'' said Andrei Ryabov of the Moscow Carnegie
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists are the country's largest party mainly by
default. Most of the parties that have emerged since the 1991
Soviet collapse have failed to attract lasting support or to
develop a strong ideological alternative to the Communists'
well-known line.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Communists' main challenge is to keep their position as
Russia's main opposition force,'' Ryabov said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is discord among the Communists about how to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 12 candidates in the presidential race are former
Communist backers who have broken from the party: filmmaker
Stanislav Govorukhin, lawmaker Alexei Podberyozkin and Kemerovo
regional Gov. Aman Tuleyev.
</P>
<P>
   Govorukhin says the Communists have gone soft and calls for a
tighter nationalist line. Podberyozkin, meanwhile, says the party
is inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov appears to be seeking middle ground. On the campaign
trail, he rarely utters the word communism. He said Russia could
learn from social-democratic governments in Sweden and France.
</P>
<P>
   But his platform relies on renationalizing oil companies,
reversing most privatization and cracking down on capital flows. He
talks of ensuring press freedom and other rights, and then praises
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the party's supporters are retirees. Their savings have
been wiped out by inflation and banking crises. Their pensions
average $18 a month -- when they are paid on time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe the Soviet system wasn't right, but wasn't it better
than this?'' asked 78-year-old Fyodor Polkov, who worked in a
tractor factory for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the impression of a spent force, the Communists have
been inconsistent in their role as Russia's leading opposition
force.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party has the largest faction in Russia's lower
house of parliament, and together with hard-line allies blocked
some of Yeltsin's key reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Communist lawmakers backed down on other key votes,
approving Yeltsin's budgets and his frequent government reshuffles.
Observers said the Communists preferred compromise to the threat of
Yeltsin disbanding parliament if they didn't oblige.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, an ex-KGB agent, has won over some Communist voters with
talk of restoring law and order and Russia's global clout. Some
reformers say Putin's and Zyuganov's platforms are remarkably
similar, and either could introduce a new totalitarianism.

<HEADLINE> Organic Farmers Question New Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- To organic farmer John Sundquist, the hedge
of blackberry bushes bordering a plot of leafy red mustard and
blooming arugula is as important as the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist, who farms 33 acres of old river-bottom land between
Coburg and Harrisburg, says the hedges offer food and habitat for
wildlife. In his eyes, organic growers must be able to farm
indefinitely without harming or depleting the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not making money hand over fist, but I'm providing a lot
of wildlife cover,'' says Sundquist, 52. ''What is the value of
living a life that can't be sustained?''
</P>
<P>
   For many organic farmers, philosophy, lifestyle, politics and
conservation principles are inextricably intertwined with farming
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Such values form the ''National Organic Program Revised Proposed
Rule,'' the 652-page document released earlier this month by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The document suggests national
standards for organic produce, livestock and processed goods.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, when finalized, will affect organic growers and
processors nationally, including the 486 growers registered with
the Oregon Department of Agriculture. A 90-day comment period ends
June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Baker, policy director of the international Organic
Materials Review Institute, based in Eugene, says some of the
proposed regulations are stricter than standards set by certifiers
and state organic programs, including Oregon's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tightening all the way around,'' he says. ''It's
certainly going to be interesting to hear the comments.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The tougher it is, the better,'' says Jack Gray of the
150-acre Winter Green Farm in Noti.
</P>
<P>
   The organic market has grown at a rate of 20 percent a year
nationally for the past decade, drawing in producers beyond farmers
such as Sundquist, whose farm reflects his passions and
idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   ''On behalf of Oregon Tilth, I would say we're interested in
changing the way agriculture is conducted, not just nationally but
internationally as well,'' says J.J. Haapala, who is research and
education director for Oregon Tilth and who cultivates 20 acres at
a farm in Junction City.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mixed bag when you have large processors like General
Mills coming on board, but it does demonstrate that the body of
agriculture is moving toward more-sustainable practices. And that's
a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the proposed regulations will raise the bar for
the organic community, says Baker of the Organic Materials Review
Institute. On the whole, the document tends toward the stringent
end of existing standards around the country, and in some cases,
goes beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed regulations are so involved that many questions
remain. This week at the Organic Trade Show in Anaheim, Calif.,
members will hear presentations on the standards. The National
Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture will meet to discuss
implications. Haapala expects the meetings to result in a position
statement at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between the black and white of obvious organics are many
shades of gray,'' Haapala says. ''We will need to look at the devil
in the details of this plan -- and it's such a huge document, we're
going to need more than 30 days just to read it.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Expects Interest Rates To Rise  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is prepared to keep
boosting interest rates until the speeding economy slows to a more
sustainable pace that's not likely to spark inflation, private
economists believe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, has
raised new worries that too-rapid growth could derail the
record-breaking economy, which entered 108 months of uninterrupted
growth in March. Many economists took those remarks as a signal
that higher interest rates would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greenspan is behaving like a track coach,'' said Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI economist David Wyss. ''He is telling us not to blow
out. By running a smooth and steady pace, you can keep going a lot
longer and a lot faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew by a breakneck 6.9 percent annual rate in the
final three months of 1999 and many economists believe growth in
the current quarter will come in around 5 percent, far above the
3.5 percent rate the Fed would like to see at this stage of the
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, many economists predict the central bank is poised
to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the fifth rate
increase since June.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee was
scheduled to meet today to review interest rate policy. A
midafternoon announcement of its decision was expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has already raised rates four times in quarter-point
steps, boosting the federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks in turn have increased their prime lending rate
in lockstep with the Fed's moves, pushing the benchmark for
millions of consumer and business loans to 8.75 percent, its
highest level since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But, thus far, those higher rates have done little to either
slow the economy or its main engine -- consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as though the economy has an incredible head of steam
and the momentum just won't go away,'' said William Cheney, chief
economist for John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has warned in recent speeches that the strong consumer
demand, which he said was being powered by the surge in wealth
created by the stock market, cannot continue to outstrip supply
without triggering serious inflation problems.
</P>
<P>
   To some Fed watchers, Greenspan's warning seemed to indicate the
Fed was aiming its interest rate increases squarely at the
high-flying stock market, prompting some in Congress to question
what business the Fed has in trying to jack up interest rates in
order to make stock prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe Greenspan's comments were misinterpreted and
the point he was trying to make was that strong demand, from
whatever source, needs to moderate in order to keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been on a wild ride this year, with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average posting huge declines from late January
until last week, when it roared back to life with a 666-point gain
for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, even with robust growth, core inflation has remained
tame. Prices at both the wholesale and consumer levels surged in
February, but that was largely due to a big jump in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another rate increase would ''combat any inflation that may be
lurking out there,'' said Richard Yamarone, economist with Argus
Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond today's meeting, many economists are looking for at least
two more rate increases -- at the May 16 meeting and the June 28
meeting -- pushing the funds rate up to 6.5 percent, the highest it
has been since January 1991 when George Bush was in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   After that, many analysts believe the central bank will sit back
and watch how the economy reacts during the summer and fall
presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Resume Drive for State  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Palestinians resume their drive for a
state and for part of Jerusalem as the Clinton administration
reopens Middle East negotiations today at a screened-off Air Force
base in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by two major Israeli concessions, the Clinton
administration will play an attentive host as Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators take up the statehood and Jerusalem issues,
as well as another projected Israeli pullback on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran American mediators Dennis Ross and Aaron Miller will
alternate between the two delegations, with about a week of
negotiations in prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would like Israel to consent to
statehood, and President Clinton has backed ''Palestinian
aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has vowed to declare a state if Israel doesn't yield in
the months ahead. If he does, Israel is considering a unilateral
move of its own: recognizing a state in part of the West Bank,
annexing clusters of Jewish settlements there and declaring it is
willing to negotiate the future of the rest of the territory, about
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, opening at lunch today in a townhouse at Bolling Air
Force Base, also will take up another promised Israeli withdrawal
on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has already conceded 41 percent of the land and all of
Gaza, and it has promised another withdrawal in June. Prime
Minister Ehud Barak is likely to improve on the amount of
additional land that his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, was
prepared to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The goal set by Clinton, Arafat and Barak is a final accord by
mid-September that would settle Palestinian statehood demands and
the future of Jerusalem, which Israel reunited in 1967 by expelling
Jordanian troops from the eastern section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is eyeing the eastern part of the city as a Palestinian
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to try his personal diplomacy this weekend with
Syrian President Hafez Assad in a parallel bid for a second Middle
East accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser attributes the stepped-up
U.S. role to dynamics abroad, not to any effort to build a larger
legacy for Clinton in his final year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is not the friend of peace in the Middle East,'' said
Sandy Berger, traveling with Clinton in South Asia. ''Any sense of
urgency comes from their clocks and not our clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing he would meet Sunday with Assad in Geneva,
Switzerland, Clinton said in Dhaka, Bangladesh: ''I don't want to
unduly raise expectations, but I think this is an appropriate thing
for me to do to try to get this back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction in Damascus to the announcement.
The government-controlled Syrian media continue to question
Israel's interest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said the United States hopes the Geneva
meeting will bring about a resumption of the Israel-Syrian
negotiations broken off in mid-January, but that is not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Sending a signal of compromise, Israel's Cabinet approved on
Sunday a pullback from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, which puts a
Jewish settlement under the effective security control of the
Palestinians for the first time and gives the Palestinians land on
the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen families in the tiny gated Jewish settlement
called Negohot, about an hour's drive from Jerusalem, may be
subjected to Palestinian checks entering and leaving their
community.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat lays claim to virtually all of the West Bank, where tens
of thousands of Jews live. Most of it remains under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
   In another significant concession by Barak's government, Israel
will give the Palestinians three suburbs near, but not abutting,
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Ross and Miller
intend to ''be helpful'' to the negotiators but may not participate
in all meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian delegations.
The delegations are led by senior negotiators Oded Eran for Israel
and Yasser Abed Rabbo and Saeb Erekat for the Palestinians.

Pentagon Delays Missile Defense Test
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The next test of the National Missile Defense system has
been postponed until late June, a Pentagon official said Monday. Because of the
delay, it is uncertain whether President Clinton will still be in office to make
the deployment decision, and whether the system can be completed by the target
date of 2005. Pentagon officials will announce the delay at a news conference
Tuesday, spokesman Lt Col. Lane Vandesteeg said. The test, originally scheduled
for April 27, will be held on June 26. Defense Secretary William Cohen had
planned to review the readiness of the missile defense project in June.

Pope Tours Holy Land

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- On the first day of his long-awaited spiritual tour of
the Holy Land, Pope John Paul II received warm receptions from both Christians
and Muslims in Jordan. The next stop -- Israel -- might be a bit more
tumultuous. The frail 79-year-old pope will greet thousands of the faithful at a
Mass in Jordan's capital today, the second day of his weeklong Holy Land
pilgrimage, before heading on to neighboring Israel. He will be welcomed by
Israel's president and prime minister -- a sharp contrast to the last papal
visit in 1964, when Pope Paul VI and Israeli leaders pointedly kept their
distance and the pope avoided saying the country's name in public.

attack on Kashmir's small Sikh community since separatist Muslims launched their
insurgency 10 years ago. Sikhs are considered a neutral minority, but Indian
officials earlier had warned of violence by Muslim militants hoping to draw
attention to Kashmir during Clinton's visit. India and Pakistan claim the

territory of Kashmir. Clinton, the first American president to visit India in 22
years, and his daughter, Chelsea, walked hand-in-hand to the memorial and bowed
their heads silently as a wreath of white flowers was laid. Afterward, Clinton
hoped to persuade reluctant Indian leaders to ban nuclear testing and cool

<HEADLINE> Col. Gov, Walters Spar Over Ramsey  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- She's one of the most famous interviewers in
television history. But Colorado Gov. Bill Owens doesn't like
Barbara Walters' style -- and told her so on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' Owens accused Walters on
Monday of going soft in her interview with John and Patsy Ramsey
last week. Walters said she resented the governor's comments.
</P>
<P>
   He was on ABC's morning show for his reaction to the interview
and Walters was subbing for host Diane Sawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Walters' interview with the parents of JonBenet Ramsey was aired
on ABC's ''20/20'' last week. They have written a book about the
slaying of their 6-year-old daughter, suggesting a male intruder
killed her in their Boulder, Colo., home.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said that the Ramseys should cooperate more with
investigators and quit hiding behind ''easy journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In your interview you had a chance to really follow up,''
Owens said to Walters. ''You had a chance to give America some new
information on this case. And yes, they came to you with no
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, you know, they didn't go to Peter Jennings, they didn't
go to Tom Brokaw,'' he said. ''They went to you. And I think we
should have expected more from that interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Walters responded: ''I have to say, governor, I rather resent
your implication that if they had gone to Peter Jennings or Tom
Brokaw, they would have had a tougher interview. I think the
interview was relatively tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said that the Ramseys should have been forced to talk
about whether they have cooperated with the murder investigation
and their delay in agreeing to a formal police interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   ''They, in fact, misled the American television audience on a
number of occasions on Friday night with no follow-up by Miss
Walters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walters gave Owens a taste of follow-up questions. She asked him
three times what new information he had that the Ramseys could have
given on the air. Finally, the governor said he would not disclose
any new information because he has sworn not to talk about the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Walters wasn't available to talk about the Owens interview later
Monday. Spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said: ''It was our feeling that
Barbara did a very thorough and probing interview with the Ramseys.
We're proud of it and don't think she has anything to apologize
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulder authorities have said the Ramseys remain under a cloud
of suspicion in the case. Owens has stopped short of calling the
Ramseys suspects in JonBenet's slaying but contended they are
trying to ''orchestrate a feeling across the country that they are
the victims in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on ''Good Morning America'' whether he believed John or
Patsy Ramsey, or both, were responsible for murdering their child,
he said he would not answer.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Death Toll at 330  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- After several hundred members of a
religious sect committed suicide in southwestern Uganda,
psychiatrists and theologians blamed poverty, the AIDs epidemic and
the country's Roman Catholic church for the rise of doomsday cults.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, hundreds of cult members burned to death inside a
chapel on the sect's prosperous farm near Kanungu, 220 miles
southwest of Kampala. Authorities are treating the deaths as a mass
suicide, one of the largest in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Banura, a theologian at Makerere University, said church
officials ostracized the leaders of the 10-year-old Movement for
the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God -- all former
Catholics -- when they disagreed with certain sections of the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somehow the official (Catholic) church made a mistake by
isolating these people,'' Banura said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a bulldozer pushed the charred remains of several
hundred members of the religious sect into a mass grave. Police and
prisoners from a nearby jail were to complete the burial today in a
trench dug from the red earth where sect members grew sugar cane,
bananas and pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Edward Rugumayo said Monday that police had
counted 330 dead, including 78 children. Earlier reports had put
the death toll as high as 600 and as low as 235. Rugumayo said the
group kept meticulous records in a small office in the compound and
had recorded the names of nearly 1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   But police at the scene said they were unable to separate many
of the bodies, which were fused together by the intense heat from
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy occurred as Uganda celebrates more than a decade of
peace and growing prosperity -- at least in urban areas -- after
years of anarchy and civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Florence Baingana, head of the mental health division at the
Ministry of Health, believes people who lived in the shadow of the
dictatorial regime of Idi Amin are naturally vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our history has made us more vulnerable because life was very
hard,'' she said. ''People have these gaps in their lives --
spiritual gaps -- and they look for different ways of filling them,
like joining cults.''
</P>
<P>
   Several religious cults that grew out of Amin's brutal 1971-79
rule later turned into guerrilla movements, one headed by a woman
named Alice Auma Lakwena.
</P>
<P>
   The Kanungu cult was also headed by a woman, a 40-year-old
former prostitute named Clendonia Mwerinde who claimed the Virgin
Mary had appeared to her in a vision and told her and close
colleagues not to follow mainstream Catholic religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Police first claimed that Mwerinde and other cult leaders died
in the church fire. But Rugumayo said only two bodies had been
identified -- one of the farm manager and the other described as
that of a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Banura said three of the male leaders were suspended from the
church in the early 1990s because they opposed receiving communion
while standing, preferring instead to be on their knees.
</P>
<P>
   None of Uganda's 26 Catholic bishops could be reached for
comment. Catholic officials in Kampala said they had gone on
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholicism, established in Uganda in the late 19th
century, was the country's first Christian denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Grace Kaiso, secretary-general of the Uganda Joint
Christian Council, said the combination of widespread AIDS, rapid
urbanization, poverty and the growing popularity of nontraditional
Christian churches served as a backdrop to the tragedy at Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are leaving their rural areas and losing their local
network, which takes care of them,'' he said. ''AIDs has meant
people have fewer opportunities of support as relatives and friends
die. The fact that so many people have died has also given rise to
the belief that the end of the world is near. They see all these
bad things and think, 'Why invest in the future?' ''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Discuss US-India Trading  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India is removing decades-old barriers
against hundreds of U.S. products and slashing import duties on
high technology ranging from cell phones to computers.
</P>
<P>
   And, as India planned the first visit by an American president
in two decades, the U.S. Export-Import Bank announced guarantees of
up to $1 billion in loans as an incentive for small and midsize
Indian companies to buy American products.
</P>
<P>
   India is hoping to build on that economic climate while
President Clinton is in India. Clinton met with Indian leaders
today on the first full day of a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 52 years since it gained independence from
Britain, India pursued a socialist economic pattern of state-run
enterprises, nationalization of banks, investment in heavy industry
and tariffs that protected local products.
</P>
<P>
   India still has a long way to go in eliminating red tape,
corruption, bribery and suffocating paperwork before it is
attractive to Western business.
</P>
<P>
   The world's two largest democracies, India and the United
States, had two-way trade of $10 billion in 1998-99. U.S. exports
to India are growing by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In January, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said
India had agreed to remove decades-old trade barriers from hundreds
of U.S. products ranging from manufactured goods to food. Half the
restrictions were to be lifted within three months, with the
remaining restrictions eliminated by April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Indian relations suffered a major setback after the United
States and other Western countries imposed economic sanctions
following India's tests of nuclear devices in 1998. Neighboring
Pakistan, which Clinton is visiting briefly, also was placed under
sanctions that bar bank loans and severely limit investment.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the idea of globalization is finally taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   Two Indian software companies, Infosys and Satyam, have had
highly successful listings on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Azim
Premji, head of an Indian computer company, Wipro, has been ranked
among the five richest people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian company, Tata Tea, this month bought British tea
company Tetley in a $433.6 million deal. British tea plantations
had been a symbol of India's colonization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risks in India are because of the slowness of our system.
It is the hassle factor,'' said Gurcharan Das, an economist. He
does not expect rapid change, as experienced by the so-called Asian
Tiger economies of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''India will not be a tiger. It will be an elephant, hopefully a
wise elephant. ... The democratic process slows you down,'' Das in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Slowness is practically a byword for doing business in India.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the U.S. power company Cogentrix, based in
Charlotte, N.C., abandoned a $1.3 billion, 1,000-megawatt
electricity project in the southern state of Karnataka after legal
wrangles and seven years of delays in getting government
clearances.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers go abroad and scout for investment like
good salesmen, said Anand Seth, joint director of the federation of
Indian Export Organizations. ''But when the investors arrive in the
country, they are confronted with bureaucratic delays and
corruption,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, during the past year India received less than 17
percent of the $10 billion in foreign investment the government had
counted on.

<HEADLINE> Errors Blamed in Suspect's Release  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Errors by poorly trained immigration agents
and design flaws in their computerized lookout system are blamed by
an inspector general for the release of a suspected ''railroad
killer'' wanted by the FBI and state police.
</P>
<P>
   A firestorm of protest enveloped the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's handling of the illegal alien, Angel
Maturino Resendiz, also known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, because
he allegedly murdered four more people in this country after INS'
Border Patrol released him back to Mexico on June 2, 1999. When
released, he was wanted by the FBI, Texas Rangers and Houston
police for questioning about murders near rail lines in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Since his surrender July 13, he has been charged with seven
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The INS promised to fix the problems cited Monday by acting
Justice Department Inspector Robert Ashbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the report painted a picture of
''Keystone Kops'' and that the House immigration subcommittee he
chairs was investigating the case and other crimes by deportable
aliens who have been released.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general recommended that INS' computerized IDENT
fingerprint and lookout system be linked ''as soon as possible''
with the FBI's computerized fingerprint and criminal history
system. He noted, however, that the FBI did not convert from paper
to computer records until a month after Resendiz's release.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Justice Department announced a plan to link
those databases but said it could take five years and substantially
more than $200 million to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The INS said it would proceed ''as expeditiously as possible in
the proposed merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report absolved the INS Border Patrol
agent who released Resendiz after he was apprehended in the desert
near Santa Teresa, N.M. ''The agent did not know that Resendiz was
wanted in connection with several murders, had been previously
deported three times by the INS or had an extensive criminal
record,'' because that information was not in IDENT, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Houston police and Texas Rangers had contacted
INS investigative and intelligence officers three times between
January and March to obtain information about Resendiz and have a
lookout posted for him. The FBI issued a federal warrant for him
May 27.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet, none of the INS investigators who were contacted by the
law enforcement officers seeking Resendiz in early 1999 thought to
have a lookout for him placed in IDENT,'' the report said. ''One
investigator apparently did nothing, and two other investigators
referred the police to Customs Service employees to place a lookout
for Resendiz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Customs computer is used for lookouts at guarded border
crossings, but Resendiz usually crossed in desolate areas, the
report said. Even so, Customs didn't post a lookout until after
June 21.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized these immigration agents for not
telling local police about IDENT or its information on prior border
crossings by Resendiz, which could have given them leads.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticized INS for training Border Patrol agents
about IDENT, but not immigration investigative and intelligence
agents. ''Many INS employees ..., particularly those outside the
Border Patrol, had little knowledge about IDENT,'' the report said.
''And no IDENT training was provided to INS intelligence employees
outside the Border Patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   INS promised to devise a plan that ''intensifies and
standardizes IDENT training.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general noted that he had criticized IDENT
training in 1998 but that INS had ''largely rejected'' his
recommendation for improving it.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized INS for putting only new lookouts
into IDENT, when it was installed in 1997, but Resendiz had many
convictions and deportations before IDENT was installed. INS agreed
historical data would have been useful but said that it did not
have the money to include it.

<HEADLINE> Primary Changes May Alter Strategy  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The earliest end ever to a presidential
primary season has opened a debate on whether elections should be
coordinated to give more voters more of a say.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties recently met to
discuss this very topic after the presidential nominees became
clear just six weeks into an 18-week season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a crazy quilt system that makes no sense whatsoever,''
said Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga. ''All of a sudden Iowa's the Holy
Grail, then New Hampshire, then Washington (state). And the entire
universe follows like a pack of puppies from minute
constituencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in about half of the states won't get to help choose the
nominees because Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al
Gore locked up the Republican and Democratic nominations last week
during a slate of Southern primaries dubbed ''Stupor Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The six contests in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and Texas became moot when challengers John McCain and
Bill Bradley bowed out a week earlier after Bush and Gore dominated
the Super Tuesday contests held in more than a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois voters go to the polls today and officials are
expecting a low turnout because the presidential nominations are
largely decided and there are no interesting statewide contests on
the ballot. The situation is likely to be the same in other states
holding primaries through June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew and his GOP
counterpart, Jim Nicholson, met last week to discuss ideas for
amending the primary calendar, including coordinating elections by
region, time zone, and population -- or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries of state have endorsed dividing the country into
four regions, with each state in the region voting on the same day
and a month separating each regional election. The region that
votes first would go last the next time around, and New Hampshire
and Iowa would retain their traditional kickoff roles.
</P>
<P>
   The East would inaugurate such a system in 2004, followed by the
South in 2008, the Midwest in 2012 and the West in 2016.
</P>
<P>
   Some say such a system could influence what type of politician
seeks the White House. For example, a social conservative might be
more apt to run when the South kicks off the regional primaries,
while a social liberal might be encouraged to run when the East is
first.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say a rotation would level the playing field, but
opponents contend it infringes on states' rights and changes the
dynamics of an election.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that while Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina
each had a disproportionate effect on the GOP primary this year,
those states are in different regions. That, they say, forced
candidates to appeal to different constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This plan could pit region against region,'' said Sen. Paul
Coverdell, R-Ga., Bush's liaison in the Senate. ''It reminds me of
Washington types who think they can sit around over coffee or beer
and fix everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Fowler, a South Carolinian and former DNC chairman, prefers
the regional plan.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal would separate states by time zone. Critics say
it would be confusing, especially since time zones don't
necessarily correspond to state boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South is the South for a reason -- it's a region,'' said
Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin, who supports a
regional primary. ''People don't say, 'Hey, I'm an Eastern
time-zoner, what are you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Sen. Bill Brock, head of a GOP commission
studying the primary calendar, supports the so-called ''Delaware
plan'' that would allow the smallest states to vote first, with
larger ones voting last. The idea is to force candidates to
acknowledge the small states, but California and Texas are crying
foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think change is badly needed,'' Nicholson, the Republican
chairman, said recently. Without it, ''we're headed inexorably to a
national primary day and I think that would be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, the Democratic chairman, said the goal has to be
increasing voter participation, ''not just a rigid system that
tries to spread things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Should all of the ideas fall through, Rep. Bob Riley, R-Ala.,
has a solution. ''Personally, I'd like to see the primaries held
alphabetically,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sylvia Plath's Journals Detailed  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- American poet Sylvia Plath, who committed suicide
after a failed marriage, blamed her mother for the death of ''the
only man who'd love me steady through life'' -- her father,
according to her diaries to be published in full for the first time
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries, extracts of which have been serialized in London's
The Guardian newspaper this week, provide new details about Plath's
troubled life and her turbulent marriage to British poet Ted
Hughes. Plath gassed herself in her kitchen at the age of 30 a few
months after Hughes left her for another woman.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her death in 1963, Plath had just one book
published under her name. But a decade later, she was considered a
feminist martyr, the mourned and beloved author of the ''Ariel''
poems and the novel ''The Bell Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third and final installment of extracts from ''The
Journals of Sylvia Plath,'' The Guardian published today a long
entry dated Dec. 12, 1958, where Plath wrote about a counseling
session with psychiatrist Dr. Ruth Beuscher.
</P>
<P>
   Describing it as better than ''shock treatment,'' Plath said the
psychiatrist gave her permission to hate her mother. '''I hate her,
doctor.' So I feel terrific,'' Plath wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Plath's mother, Aurelia, raised the writer and her brother,
Warren, after their father died in 1940 from complications brought
on by diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She came home crying like an angel one night and woke me up
and told me Daddy was gone, he was what they called dead, and we'd
never see him again, but the three of us would stick together and
have a jolly life anyhow, to spite his face,'' Plath wrote. ''Me, I
never knew the love of a father, the love of a steady blood-related
man after the age of eight. My mother killed the only man who'd
love me steady through life.''
</P>
<P>
   Plath admitted her mother had a ''lousy life'' and said she felt
pity for her. ''But that is only pity. Not love,'' Plath added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate her because he wasn't loved by her,'' Plath wrote. ''He
was an ogre. But I miss him. He was old, but she married an old man
to be my father. It was her fault. Damn her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to her journals, the counseling session also explored
Plath's relationship with Hughes, whom she met at Cambridge
University in England and married in 1956. After her death, Hughes,
who later became Britain's poet laureate, was demonized by some
Plath fans. His name was even chipped off her tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   After saying little about their marriage, Hughes died from
cancer in 1998. Only months before his death, he published
''Birthday Letters,'' a poetic -- and often touching -- account of
their relationship that has led many to re-evaluate the famous
pair.
</P>
<P>
   Plath wrote that her psychiatrist asked if she would have the
''guts to admit you'd made a wrong choice?''
</P>
<P>
   ''In a husband. I would,'' Plath said. ''But nothing in me gets
scared or worried at this question. I feel good with my husband ...
What is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that
boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my
husband. So I don't want to look around any more: I don't need to
look around for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian's extracts conclude with the last line from Plath's
surviving journals. Dated Nov. 15, 1959, Plath wrote: ''A bad day.
A bad time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her last journal, which Plath kept until three days before her
death, was destroyed by Hughes, who said he did not want their
children to have to read it.
</P>
<P>
   After Plath's death, Hughes maintained control over her journals
and permitted only a much-edited version to be published in 1982.
The couple's children are now permitting publication of the
complete diaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Journals of Sylvia Plath,'' edited by Karen V. Kukil, will
be published on April 3.

<HEADLINE> Group Wants Census Bureau Apology  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Census Bureau expressed its regrets once
again for providing information that helped the military ferret out
and detain Japanese-Americans during World War II, and stressed
such breaches in confidentiality will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   A research paper authored by two scholars, professors William
Seltzer of Fordham University and Dr. Margo Anderson of the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, concluded that the Census Bureau
supplied demographic data to the War Department following the
bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. The data was broken down
into geographic units as small as city blocks, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been reported previously, the authors stressed.
Nevertheless, their findings again stirred critics who contend the
Census Bureau never officially made amends for assisting the
military in locating areas of Japanese concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask for the census director to make an apology about that,
because it's taken so long for that information to come out,''
Karen Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific
American Legal Consortium, said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very disappointed and deeply troubled that the
internment of Japanese Americans was actively facilitated by the
Census Bureau,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deeply regret any role that the Census Bureau played in a
really sad, sad (time) in our history,'' said Martina Hone,
associate undersecretary for the Commerce Department, which
oversees the Census Bureau. ''We want to reassure the community
it's not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said Monday the Clinton
administration has previously apologized for the government's role
in detaining Japanese-Americans during World War II and stands by
the apology. Technically, the bureau did not break the law then in
effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a sad, shameful moment in American political
history,'' Prewitt said. ''The Census Bureau's legal obligation and
ethical policies would never allow a repeat of what occurred in
1942.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper is being distributed Saturday at a conference in Los
Angeles of the Population Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The research paper quotes Dr. Leon Truesdell, then the Census
Bureau's chief population statistician, as saying to the Census
Advisory Committee in January 1942: ''We got a request yesterday,
for example, from one of the Navy officers in Los Angeles, wanting
figures in more or less geographic detail for the Japanese
residents in Los Angeles, and we are getting that out.''
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting on Jan. 10, 1942, when senior Census Bureau
officials indicated they were already providing the military
tract-level data on Japanese-Americans, the paper quotes the bureau
director, J.C. Capt, as saying he would give military officials
''further means of checking individuals'' if they wanted names of
Japanese-Americans in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer noted his paper also said other Census officials took
different views over use of demographics to keep track of the
population, specifically a then-proposed ''population register.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer quotes Forrest E. Linder, a Census demographer in 1942:
''Traditional American thinking regarding freedom of action and
thought might consider a mandatory identification register an
infringement of that liberty and the beginning of an American
'Gestapo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, the bureau's current director, said the agency
''cooperated with the war effort by providing special tabulations
of the Japanese-American population for counties and county
subdivisions.'' He stressed there is no evidence that individual
census records went to the War Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau still provides such data today, but it is
coded to ensure that individuals' addresses will not be known, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of challenges the Census Bureau faces -- like
saying 'trust us' to the public,'' said Narasaki, voicing
confidence in the bureau's current confidentiality policy. ''Our
community understands that the information is confidential.''

By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez has announced an
ambitious plan to rebuild Venezuela's northern coastal region,
which has been devastated by landslides and flooding that killed
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally televised speech Monday night, Chavez laid out
plans to spend more than a billion dollars to rebuild thousands of
homes, expand the country's main airport and construct canals that
can channel the fury of raging rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists estimate total damage caused by December's disaster
to be between $10 billion and $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a leftist nationalist who counts Fidel Castro
among his close friends, said the reconstruction ''requires the
participation of the private sector'' because the government cannot
shoulder the costs on its own.
</P>
<P>
   He said the program involves building new homes for 40,000 slum
dwellers and 1,294 middle class homes in the state of Vargas, where
last Dec. 15 massive avalanches of mud, water and boulders came
crashing down the mountain that separates Caracas from the
Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between 5,000 and 30,000 people were killed, though
the exact number of dead is not known. More than 100,000 people
were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not abandon Vargas to the grace of God,'' said Chavez,
a former army paratrooper who staged an unsuccessful coup attempt
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that in the three months since the disaster,
his government has invited experts from around the world to assess
Vargas' needs and figure out how to rebuild out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   This, Chavez said, will involve building huge canals in Vargas'
towns and villages that can channel any future flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In two towns, Tanaguarenas and Los Corales, he said the
government would expropriate land to build the canals.
</P>
<P>
   The president said another two towns, Macuto and Camuri Chico,
would be restored to their previous status as tourist meccas for
the capital city's five million residents.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government would spend $100 million to expand
Venezuela's main international airport located in Vargas state,
including the construction of a new hotel. The country's main sea
port, also in Vargas, would be ''modernized,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In his three-hour speech, he showed drawings, computer graphics
and blueprints of how the state will look once reconstruction is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' worst hit towns, including devastated Carmen de Uria
where most structures were swept out to sea, will not be rebuilt at
all, Chavez said. Instead, they will be turned into parks, bathing
resorts or other outdoor facilities.

<HEADLINE> Study: Empathy Eases Depression  </HEADLINE>
By MEKI COX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- David Grande knows how to heal broken bones,
prescribe powerful drugs and perform surgery. Empathy, though, was
only touched on briefly at his medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet doctors and student physicians like Grande who lend an
empathetic ear to caregivers for the terminally ill can make a
difference, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors who really listen to patients and caregivers and spend
time understanding, that lessens the burdens on caregivers. They
feel heard. It's a key element to feeling supported,'' said lead
researcher Ezekiel J. Emanuel of the Department of Clinical
Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Without doctors' intervention, caregivers to patients with a lot
of physical needs were significantly more likely to be depressed,
forced to take out loans to pay for health costs and deal with
patients considering euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In the study in today's issue of the Philadelphia-based Annals
of Internal Medicine, 42 percent of caregivers with non-empathetic
doctors reported depressive symptoms, compared to 27 percent of
those with an empathetic doctor, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Helping doctors empathize could be taught through a more
formalized and structured curriculum during medical school,
internships and residency trainings, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Such teachings could make the dying experience more pleasant for
everybody, Emanuel said. Caregivers with a good attitude could even
make terminally ill patients feel less guilty about the pressures
they may put others under.
</P>
<P>
   Better training for doctors may also reduce the chances
caregivers will undergo costly medical care for their own
depression, he said. Too often, though, doctors aren't trained that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the later years, there were no role models practicing these
things, so it's difficult to expect students to learn it and put
those skills in action in their own practice,'' said Grande,
president of the American Medical Student Association in Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care groups refer patients to community-based
organizations that could provide such services without extra costs,
said Mohit Ghose, spokesman for the Washington-based American
Association of Health Plans, the largest trade group to represent
managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''But a study like this takes us into that next level of
discussion on how to include such benefits in a standard package in
taking care of hospice patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted in six randomly selected cities with 988
terminally ill patients with different illnesses and 893
caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies showed that terminal illnesses create high
economic burdens, but they did not say why. The latest study shows
that high caregiving needs, like transportation, homemaking and
personal care, are the driving cause behind a caregivers'
depression and financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 26 years, Suzanne Mintz, president of the National
Family Caregivers Association in Kensington, Md., has been a
caregiver to her husband who suffers from multiple sclerosis. She
said the study is a wake-up call to physicians and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although their legal responsibility is to the patient, the
concept of illness and disability is a family affair,'' Mintz said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Want Higher Price Supports  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Roger Winter lost $28,000 on his wheat and
dairy farm in Callaway, Minn., last year, and is in Washington this
week trying to make sure that doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here to be a voice for the rest of the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winter is one of more than 1,000 farmers participating in the
Rally for Rural America this week, aimed at increasing crop
supports for struggling family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The main villain for the mostly Democratic gathering, dubbed
''Rally for Rural America,'' was the 1996 Freedom to Farm law,
which reduced crop subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Family farmers have been the victim of bad public policy in
this country, and it's time to straighten it out,'' said Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman agreed. ''It is time to
rewrite that 1996 Freedom to Farm bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation called for price supports to be gradually scaled
back over seven years. The law, pushed by Republicans, was intended
to wean farmers from federal support, but since its passage
Congress has passed several multibillion-dollar bailouts. Last
year, the package totaled $8.7 billion, with the bulk going to
Midwestern Corn Belt farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's made farmers more dependent on Congress,'' said Rep. Earl
Pomeroy, D-N.D. ''It's wrong -- it's just dead wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the Agriculture
Committee, has resisted holding hearings on overhauling the law,
which expires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll rewrite the farm policy in 2002 -- we have a seven-year
contract with American farmers, and it was something they wanted,''
Lugar spokesman Andy Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Farm income dropped from $53 billion in 1996 to $48 billion last
year, but Fisher said that was due to cyclical changes, not federal
farm policies.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, many wearing baseball caps and a few sporting
cowboy hats, were organized by the National Farmers Union and a
coalition of other organizations. They were bused in from all over
the country, with the largest contingents from Minnesota and North
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers also complained about agribusiness mergers. The
resulting mega-companies dominate the marketplace, making it harder
for family farmers to get a good price for their crops, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., promised to re-introduce
legislation calling for a moratorium on agriculture mergers, after
polling the crowd in a tent on the Capitol Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll bring it back!'' he yelled. ''We'll do it!''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., used the rally to pitch legislation
calling for the U.S. government to match what European nations pay
their farmers in subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say don't blame them, let's match them,'' Conrad said.

<HEADLINE> Pope Leads Mass in Jordan  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Tens of thousands of cheering Catholics
packed a sports stadium today for a Mass led by Pope John Paul II,
who is making a special plea for interfaith harmony on his Middle
East pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has been warmly received by Jordan's small Christian
community, as well as the country's Muslim political and religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   At the Amman International Stadium, many in the crowd wore
T-shirts that featured both the pope and King Abdullah II, and
read, ''Jordan welcomes John Paul II.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the faithful came from neighboring Middle Eastern
states, including Iraq, where the pope had hoped to visit holy
sites, but ultimately dropped the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't slept for four days,'' said Odai Shaamoun, a
30-year-old waiter who traveled from Iraq's capital, Baghdad, to
see the pope. ''We hope he will pray for (Iraqis) and call for the
lifting of sanctions for the sake of our children and our
elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been under international sanctions for nearly a decade
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and the pope has expressed
sympathy for the suffering of ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who arrived Monday in Jordan for the start of his
weeklong Holy Land tour, has sought to make his visit a spiritual
celebration. But he has acknowledged the region's political strife.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this area of the world, there are grave and urgent issues
of justice, of the rights of peoples and nations which have to be
resolved,'' the pope said Monday. ''No matter how difficult, no
matter how long, the process of seeking peace must continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope could get his first taste of religious and political
controversy today.
</P>
<P>
   At his last stop in Jordan, the pope will visit the east bank of
the Jordan River, the site of Jesus' baptism, according to some
religious scholars and archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian claim has sparked a friendly cross-border rivalry
with Israel, which has long maintained that Jesus was baptized on
the west bank, now under Israeli military control.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of fair play, John Paul will be traveling to the
Israeli site later in the week. The Vatican has not taken a
position on either side's claim, and the dispute may have as much
to do with tourism revenue as religious scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   After his afternoon trip to the Jordan River, the pontiff heads
on to Israel later today. He will be welcomed by the country's
president and prime minister -- a sharp contrast to the last papal
visit in 1964, when Pope Paul VI and Israeli leaders kept their
distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has stressed that the pontiff has no political
agenda, but some Israelis and Palestinians see the trip as a forum
to press their claims for control of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's first stop in Jordan on Monday was at a site holy to
the three religions, Mount Nebo. Tradition holds that the prophet
Moses first saw the Promised Land from the hilltop after wandering
for 40 years in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The pope stood for five minutes, peering at the Dead Sea,
Jericho and the hills of Jerusalem through the afternoon haze.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our gaze directed toward Jerusalem, let us lift up our prayers
to Almighty God, for all the people living in the land of promise,
Jews, Muslims, Christians,'' he said. ''Bestow upon all who live
here the gift of true peace, justice, fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Jordanian ceremonies have been relatively low-key,
Israel is planning its biggest security operation ever.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, police on Monday ordered Palestinians to remove a
huge balloon tethered to Orient House, the PLO headquarters in the
eastern part of the city. ''Jerusalem, the eternal Palestinian
capital, welcomes His Holiness, the Pope,'' read the balloon.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, police said suspected right-wing Jewish
extremists vandalized the helipad where the papal helicopter is to
land, spray-painting swastikas and slogans such as ''Pope Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Jewish leaders welcome the pope's visit and his
statements promoting reconciliation among faiths, but they would
like him to go further in acknowledging the church's past
discrimination against Jews and its public silence during the
Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Women Miners Disappearing  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A shift to a new kind of economy may be under
way nationwide, but one of the blunt truths of the blue-collar
world is still largely unchanged: The last hired means the first
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jody Hogge of Taylorville, Ill., who in 1978 joined the
first wave of American women to go to work in underground mines by
joining Peabody Coal Co.'s No. 10 mine near Taylorville.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started at the mine there were more than 1,000 union
members working there, and maybe a dozen of them were women,''
Hogge said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Hogge joined at a good time. Employment in the American coal
industry reached its modern-day peak of 260,000 workers in 1979.
Since then, the number of miners nationwide has declined steadily,
reaching 122,000 workers in 1998, the latest year for which
complete figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Among the casualties is the Coal Employment Project. Begun in
1978, the organization was instrumental in helping many women make
the transition into an industry long dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often, I would be the only woman on a shift,'' said Cosby
Totten of Tazewell, Va., one of the founders of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The project's membership peaked in 1984 at nearly 1,000 people,
including women miners, some of their male co-workers and activists
from other unions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the organization disbanded in June of last year,
there were only 12 working miners among the 50 attendees.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the coal mining jobs being gone, there are just so
few women still working that we couldn't keep it going,'' said
Hogge, who served on the project's board of directors for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Coal Employment Project eased the transition
for many women trying to make their way into a workplace long
barred to them. Even in the 1970s, many men still believed it was
the worst kind of bad luck for a woman to go underground, a sure
bet to cause an explosion or some other disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, the women who went in first had more problems with the
men than I did,'' Hogge said. ''Some of the men even thought that
women should be paid less for doing the same job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogge was laid off from Peabody's No. 10 mine in 1991, and in
1996 the mine closed down. The decision to disband the project was
like losing part of her family, Hogge said.
</P>
<P>
   ''CEP started as a network, but it became more like we were
sisters,'' she said. ''It was really a support system. When you're
out there by yourself, there's just nobody else to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   In 13 years underground, she advanced to a skilled position as a
shuttle car operator, earning close to $17 an hour plus benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The good pay underground was attractive to women with families
to raise, and family issues became one focus of the project. Their
activism led to provisions for family leave in many coal industry
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a job Hogge, 57, needed as she and her husband struggled
to raise seven children. Although no longer a miner, she is still
active in the United Mine Workers union, often working as a labor
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, she served as a delegate to the union's
constitutional convention in Las Vegas. Her regular work is
providing home health care for homebound patients.
</P>
<P>
   She still has to answer certain questions about working
underground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like I always get asked the same two questions,'' she
said. ''Women always want to know, 'Where do you put your purse?'
and 'Where do you go to the bathroom?'''

<HEADLINE> Arrests Made in Oscar Statues Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The drama of Academy Awards night will almost
be anticlimactic after the mystery of the stolen Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 55 statues reported stolen last week were recovered
over the weekend next to a trash bin by a man scavenging for
valuables. Police said Monday that two men who worked for the
company delivering the Oscars were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did it for profit. They thought they could make money,''
said Detective Marc Zavala.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Davis, Academy executive director, said the 52 recovered
statues look fine and some probably will be awarded Sunday. If any
are ''nicked or dinged, they will not be used,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Academy officials, also stung when 4,000 Oscar ballots got
lost in the mail this month, hope their biggest remaining worry is
how host Billy Crystal will make fun of all the headaches leading
up to the big night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he'll have a field day,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Oscar theft was an inside job involving two
10-year employees of Roadway Express, the company hired to deliver
the statues. Anonymous tips received Saturday led police to the
men, but detectives would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Keith Hart and Lawrence Edward Ledent, both 38, were
arrested Saturday and booked for investigation of grand theft. They
were held on $100,000 bail each.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the oddest presentations in Oscar history, officers
wheeled two carts loaded with the statues into a news conference by
Chief Bernard Parks. Officers slipped on rubber gloves to remove
six of the Oscars from their packaging and set them on a table.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives and Academy officials said they didn't know the
location of the three other Oscars. The gold-plated statues are
13{-inches tall and weigh 8{ pounds each. The 55 statues cost about
$18,000 to manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars were shipped March 3 from manufacturer R.S. Owens of
Chicago and arrived at Roadway Express' warehouse in Bell, Calif.,
on March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Gerloff, security manager for Roadway's western division,
said the company believes Hart and Ledent made off with the statues
the same day the shipment arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy quickly put in a replacement order to R.S. Owens for
more statues to make sure enough would be on hand for Oscar
winners.
</P>
<P>
   The statues were found Sunday night by Willie Fulgear, who had
been foraging through trash bins and called police to report the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he hopes to collect some or all of a $50,000 reward
put up by Roadway Express. Gerloff said the company had not figured
out whether Fulgear would receive some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Academy executives also said they might invite Fulgear to the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   With some Oscars already in the Academy vaults and the new
statues being made, organizers now have far more than they will
need for the big night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have enough for about three years,'' Academy President
Robert Rehme said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Academy officials also said they have their fingers crossed that
nothing else goes wrong in the next five days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've even got a guy guarding Oscar tickets this year,'' Davis
said. ''Suddenly, we're paranoid about everything.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo stock Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose slightly Tuesday as
investors await a U.S. decision about whether to raise interest
rates. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues rose 36.04 points, or
0.18 percent, to close at 19,602.36 points on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. On Friday, the average closed up 313.04 points, or 1.63
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was trading at 106.48 yen on the Tokyo foreign
exchange market, up 0.54 yen from late Friday and also higher than
its late New York level of 106.36 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday for a national
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices started lower before rebounding as
players avoided making significant moves ahead of a key U.S.
monetary policy meeting scheduled for later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Market participants said they would closely monitor the U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the impact of any
interest rate decision on volatile U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street observers expect the Federal Reserve Board to
raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, the fifth
increase since last June. Higher interest rates generally send
stocks lower because they cut into corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Traders in Tokyo said investors had already factored in the
FOMC's expected decision.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Nasdaq composite index fell 188.13 to 4,610.00
at Monday's close. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.01
points to close at 10,680.24.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 1.67 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,674.22. The
TOPIX closed up 28.65 points, or 1.74 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar gained some ground against the
yen as foreign and domestic players sold the Japanese currency in
the absence of major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   But many investors were retreating to the sidelines ahead of the
Fed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 103.54 yen, up from
102.60 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8650 percent from Friday's finish of 1.8300. Its price fell
0.29 points to 99.45.

<HEADLINE> Fans Hope For a Peek at the Stars  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HARRIGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They're the best seats -- just not in the
auditorium. And competition for the bleachers that line the red
carpet for the Oscars gets tougher every year.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Glenice ''Babe'' Churchill and Sandi Stratton have been
claiming a pair of those seats for 31 years. In 1970, they arrived
on Oscar day and had no problem getting seats.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they had to show up on Saturday, eight days before
the ceremony, just to ensure a place in line for one of the 200
bleacher seats.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, they had been joined by about 20 people who had
pitched tents and supplies of food, clothes and Oscar memorabilia
on the sidewalk outside the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Churchill and Stratton have braced the elements
and ill health for the opportunity to stargaze before and after
Hollywood's most elegant party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sat through rain, cold, heat, wind, a little bit of
everything,'' said Churchill, 69, a Chino hairdresser. Her
57-year-old sister is a housewife from Escondido.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Churchill came even though she had lost her
hair during chemotherapy after cancer surgery. Stratton came the
next year despite two broken ribs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, seven younger relatives and friends are helping the
sisters hold their spots in line, sleeping in a tent and lounging
on an inflatable sofa and chair while the older women go to a
nearby motel.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill said her biggest thrill over the years was ''seeing
Paul Newman and Liz Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Hernandez publishes a newsletter and runs a Web site for
the hardy bunch of bleacher fans. She was taking a break to get a
shower Monday, but left her place in line under a friend's guard.
</P>
<P>
   The early bird fans won't be able to claim their bleacher seats
until the day of the Oscars, about 11 hours before the stars arrive
in their limousines.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the veterans, the four-star generals of the bleacher
section,'' said Chris Bergland, a security officer. ''We really
don't have any security problems with the bleacher people. They're
always cooperative. The first 20 people in line know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Once these diehard fans get in the bleachers, they stay
throughout the ceremony, Churchill said, so they can see the stars
leave.
</P>
<P>
   But they do get to see the big events occurring inside, she
added: ''We're taping it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Preaches Hope in S. Asia  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton scattered rose pedals
today at the memorial of the father of the Indian nation, revered
pacifist Mohandas Gandhi. But fresh images of violence intruded on
the first American presidential visit in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Vajpayee turned their
attention to modern-day problems facing the world's largest
democracy, a new clash in the disputed Kashmir region claimed the
lives of 35 villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, through press spokesman Joe Lockhart, expressed outrage
on behalf of all Americans. ''Our most profound sympathies go out
to the victims of this brutal massacre,'' Lockhart's statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   India's tense rivalry with Pakistan, underscored by the latest
bloodshed, and differences over nuclear weapons remained the two
toughest issues for the leaders as they worked to put an end to
lingering Cold War-era strains.
</P>
<P>
   After arrival festivities, Clinton and Vajypee and their top
aides opened talks at Hyderabad House, a 1920s-vintage palace used
by the government for meetings and banquets.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders planned a joint news conference after the
session. They were also to issue a ''vision statement'' pledging to
warmer relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hoped to persuade India to scale back its nuclear
weapons program and reopen a peace dialogue with Pakistan. But
officials of both governments held out little prospect for major
breakthroughs on either front.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's state visit began with an elegant arrival ceremony in
the courtyard of the presidential palace, Rashtrapati Bhavan, a
massive domed sandstone structure that formerly served as the home
for British viceroys.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted by an honor guard of two dozen men on horseback,
then reviewed the troops. ''I'm delighted to be here. I'm honored
to be here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he and daughter Chelsea visited the simple black marble
platform where Gandhi, the patron of nonviolence who was the
spiritual leader of India's independence from Britain, was cremated
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   With incense and Indian religious music in the air, Clinton and
Chelsea walked hand-in-hand to the memorial and bowed their heads
silently as a wreath of white flowers was laid. Then they each
scattered rose petals on the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton arrived in New Delhi Monday night after a daylong
visit to Bangladesh, gunmen massacred three dozen Sikhs in India's
Kashmir state, 400 miles to the north. Indian army officers had
said earlier they expected a major operation by pro-separatist
militants to draw attention to Kashmir during the president's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was using the episode to renew the U.S. call to both
India and Pakistan cool tensions over the disputed Himalayan
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But India has shown little willingness to reopen peace talks in
the aftermath of last October's military coup in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the United States has offered to serve as a mediator,
India has been adamant in refusing to request such a U.S. role.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do U.S. officials hold out much hope that India will agree
to abandon its nuclear weapons program or even agree to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty anytime soon, even though Clinton has
strongly urged it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Tit-for-tat nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998 shook
the world and triggered a slew of U.S. economic sanctions on both
nations, many of which remain.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clinton has strongly urged India to abandon its
nuclear ambitions and sign the treaty, ''we have no intention of
pressuring the Indians,'' national security adviser Sandy Berger
said in advance of today's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The failure by the Senate last fall to ratify the test ban
treaty weakens Clinton's hand in urging either India or Pakistan to
sign the pact, U.S. officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   However, administration officials were hopeful to win more
modest agreements from India on steps to safeguard its nuclear
arsenal and to tighten controls on exports of weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in turn, would support an easing of
remaining U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States and India seek a new, closer relationship
after years of Cold War estrangement -- when India aligned itself
with the Soviet Union the United States tilted toward Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to visit five Indian cities in five days.
</P>
<P>
   He travels to military-ruled Pakistan on Saturday for a brief
visit. Then he was to fly to Geneva for a Sunday meeting with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to urge him to resume peace
negotiations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Final arguments set in death penalty hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Lawyers have finished presenting
evidence to the jury charged with deciding whether serial killer
Michael Ross should live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Final arguments in the case are scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has admitted to raping and killing eight young women
including, and was convicted of six capital felonies.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to die in 1987. But the state Supreme Court,
while upholding the convictions, ordered the new penalty hearing.
The court ruled the state improperly withheld from the defense a
letter from a psychiatrist that could have led the original jury to
impose a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the defense again focused on the letter from Dr.
Robert Miller, who declined to testify for the prosecution 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see how I could testify to psychopathology not playing
a mitigating role in the type of penalty,'' Miller wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has since died. The final pieces of evidence presented at
the hearing included a videotape of Miller's elderly widow
testifying to the doctor's honesty and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Miller said on the tape that although she did not
routinely discuss work with her husband, she said he was a ''highly
principled, opinionated gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of a single mitigating factor in Ross' life would
be enough to spare him the death penalty. His lawyers contend he
suffers from sexual sadism.
</P>
<P>
   The state alleges Ross, a graduate of Cornell University, is
faking mental illness and is smart enough to manipulate his
psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the psychiatric mitigation, Ross' attorneys have
contended that Ross can be an asset to the medical community, which
can learn from him about his mental illness.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers react to triple-fatal fraternity house fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- State legislators have reacted to the
triple-fatal fraternity house fire at Bloomsburg University with a
resolution and a bill aimed at improving campus fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael McGeehan, D-Philadelphia, on Monday announced
legislation that would force public and private universities to
install sprinklers for all student housing within five years. The
bill, still in draft form, also would create a loan program to help
schools pay for the installations.
</P>
<P>
   While McGeehan's bill addresses the issue of fire safety in
college housing, he said it doesn't address off-campus, private
buildings such as the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity house that
burned Sunday at Bloomsburg University. He said future legislation
may target private buildings where students live.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three people killed in fire at Bloomsburg University
were from New Jersey, according to published reports. The
Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Tuesday's editions the third
victim has been identified as Kristoffer Polhemus, 21, a former
star wrestler from Hampton Borough, Hunterdon County. The early
morning blaze also killed Cliff Vail, 21, of Dunellen, and Marcus
LaBuda, 21, of Hazelton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate adopted a resolution from Sen. Michael Waugh,
R-York, that orders the Legislative Budget and Finance Committee to
study the possibility of requiring college dormitories and
high-rises to use sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution was introduced in response to a fatal dormitory
fire at Seton Hall University in New Jersey that killed three
freshmen two months ago. The resolution was awaiting action even
before the Bloomsburg University fire.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh said he had not envisioned the resolution to cover
off-campus fraternity houses.

   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel began withdrawing troops from 6.1 percent
of the West Bank on Tuesday as part of a land-for-security deal that would give
the Palestinians control over 41 percent of the disputed territory. At this army
base near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli army officers shook hands with
Palestinian security officers in a ceremony marking the land transfer. Similar
ceremonies were to take place near the West Bank cities of Hebron and Nablus.
Israeli officials gave the Palestinians five copies of the maps outlining the

   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Gunmen rounded up and killed 36 Sikh villagers in
India's disputed Kashmir state, police said Tuesday, even as President Clinton
was beginning a visit to India. Monday night's massacre was the first major
attack on Kashmir's small Sikh community since separatist Muslims launched their
insurgency 10 years ago. Sikhs are considered a neutral minority, but Indian
officials earlier had warned of violence by Muslim militants hoping to draw
attention to Kashmir during Clinton's visit. India and Pakistan claim the
Himalayan territory and have fought two wars over it.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins West Bank Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEITUNIA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel began withdrawing troops from
6.1 percent of the West Bank on Tuesday as part of a
land-for-security deal that would give the Palestinians control
over 41 percent of the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   At this army base near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli
army officers shook hands with Palestinian security officers in a
ceremony marking the land transfer. Similar ceremonies were to take
place near the West Bank cities of Hebron and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials gave the Palestinians five copies of the maps
outlining the area being transferred. Soldiers placed rocks marking
the new boundary, and Palestinian security officials waited at a
nearby gas station, ready to enter the area.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer gives the Palestinians populated swaths of land
bordering cities almost entirely under Palestinian control, giving
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat more of the contiguity he needs
for a state.
</P>
<P>
   In 5.1 percent of the West Bank being transferred, the
Palestinians were already in charge of civilian institutions but
were also being given security control. The rest of the West Bank
was going from full Israeli control to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians had demanded suburbs of Jerusalem, claimed by
both sides as their capital, but settled on the villages after five
weeks of deadlock. Many of the areas to be handed over are near but
do not border Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal came just hours after two shootings Monday night
killed a Palestinian woman and injured her husband and three
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis were injured, one of them seriously, after gunmen
in a car opened fire on them as they were delivering holiday
baskets for the Jewish festival of Purim to soldiers near Hebron.
Israeli soldiers set up roadblocks following the attack, and later
opened fire on a Palestinian car, killing the woman and seriously
injuring her husband.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said in a statement Tuesday that the soldiers
opened fire after the vehicle's driver tried to run over one of the
soldiers at the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority were on high security
alert for Tuesday's arrival of Pope John Paul II for a historic
six-day Holy Land pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   The redeployment completes a three-part phase in a series of
land transfers under interim peace accords. The peace process,
which started with a general agreement negotiated in secret in
Oslo, Norway, in 1993, envisioned a series of confidence-building
handovers of territory to Palestinian civilian control, as the two
sides negotiated a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The interim accords call for one more transfer of territory.
Israel had wanted to fold it into a withdrawal marking final
borders, but the Palestinians refused
</P>
<P>
   The sides reached a compromise in which they committed to
reaching a framework for a final peace treaty in May, with the
final interim transfer in June. Negotiators were to resume
negotiations over the framework agreement Tuesday outside
Washington, with the goal of signing the treaty itself in
September.

<HEADLINE> Activists call for federal intervention in wake of Dorismondshooting  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Community leaders and politicians have stepped
up demands for federal oversight of the New York Police Department
in the wake of the police shooting of an unarmed black Brooklyn
man.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Rev. Al Sharpton met for more than an hour with
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, head of an ongoing
investigation into whether the police department fosters abuse of
minorities through lax discipline of officers who use excessive
force.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton emerged from the closed-door meeting saying he had
urged Lynch to impose a federal monitor in brutality cases. Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, took a similar position in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''In view of the danger to which all New Yorkers are exposed in
the absence of new management policies and training procedures, we
are left with no recourse but to appeal for federal action,''
Rangel wrote in a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lynch declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at City Hall, the city's top lawyer defended Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's release of Patrick Dorismond's criminal record,
including a sealed juvenile offense.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, a security guard, was fatally shot in a scuffle
with an undercover officer outside a Manhattan bar last week.
Police and the officer's attorney have said Dorismond tried to grab
the undercover officer's gun after the officer asked him if he knew
where to buy marijuana as part of a police drug buy-and-bust
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton repeated charges that Giuliani and police Commissioner
Howard Safir had poisoned the local inquiry by making public
Dorismond's criminal record. Calling Lynch noncommittal, he said he
would organize protesters for a large-scale march on Manhattan's
Federal Plaza next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole nation is watching New York,'' Sharpton said.
''We're certainly going to let them understand that we will not be
a city run by people who would dig up in the middle of the night
people's juvenile records to try to justify'' the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at City Hall, corporation counsel Michael
Hess defended Giuliani's much-criticized public discussion of
Dorismond's juvenile record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a violation of law in any way,'' Hess said. ''The
policy of confidentiality is to allow a person who's committed an
act at a young age to rehabilitate themselves. ... When someone
dies, that right to privacy is eliminated. ... In this particular
situation, when the decedent passed away, his right to privacy ...
died with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess added that Giuliani was just trying to make sure the
information available about Dorismond's shooting was balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt to have an even-handed approach to the
public, to let the public know about the police officer and about
the decedent, and it was an attempt to balance out the
information,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton -- noting the recent acquittal in Albany of four
officers in the fatal shooting of another unarmed man, Amadou
Diallo -- also dismissed assurances by Manhattan District attorney
Robert Morganthau that his office would fully investigate the
shooting and present its findings to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to see what happened in Albany happen again
with a state bogus prosecution,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Brooklyn, seven Haitian organizations held a news
conference to rally behind Dorismond's family and protest the
release of his rap sheet, which comprised three misdemeanor cases,
none resulting in a jail sentence. Dorismond's parents are Haitian
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stand with the Dorismond family, we grieve with the
Dorismond family, we are angry with the Dorismond family,'' said
Vladimir Rodney, vice chairman and spokesman for the groups, known
as the Haitian American Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   He announced a community day of mourning on Saturday, when
Dorismond will be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Among speakers at the news conference in a Brooklyn church was
Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who was the victim of a brutal
sodomy attack in a police precinct house in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Two former police officers face long prison terms for violating
his civil rights. One of those officers plus two others were
convicted two weeks ago of a conspiracy to conceal details of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought after what happened to me there would not be any
more police brutality again,'' Louima said. ''But it seems like
it's getting worse. That makes me feel like my suffering was in
vain.''

<HEADLINE> BASF to buy herbicide division of American Home Products  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- In a move that would double its business in
agricultural chemicals, German chemical giant BASF announced plans
Monday to buy the herbicide division of American Home Products
Corp., for $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cyanamid makes herbicides, fungicides and pesticides.
Madison-based American Home has been looking to jettison the
division so it can focus on the more profitable drug business and
possibly try to merge with other big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   BASF said acquiring Cyanamid will give it a greatly expanded
product range and also said the company should be able to save $250
million a year by eliminating overlapping operations. BASF also
said the new operations would help it penetrate growing markets in
North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned the price paid for Cyanamid and worried
about the assumption of debt. But other analysts said the deal is
positive because it bolsters BASF position as one of the world's
top agrochemical producers.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is cleared by regulatory authorities, it would take
effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the German company would assume debt from AHP's
Cyanamid unit related to operations in Asia. BASF wouldn't say how
much debt it would take, but The Wall Street Journal, citing
unidentified sources in Tuesday's editions, put the figure at $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows American Home's failed attempt six months ago
to merge with Warner-Lambert Co., which is being acquired by Pfizer
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After that, American Home said it decided to sell Cyanamid.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of Cyanamid would highlight American Home's image as
a health care drug company, which also would put American Home in a
better position to possibly merge with another big drug company.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal said Swiss drug giant Novartis AG is interested, as
is Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc., which will soon complete its own merger
with Monsanto Co.
</P>
<P>
   But American Home may first have to deal with its diet-drug
liability talks before it can try another such move. This is
because some investors continue to worry a $3.29 billion charge the
company says was adequate to pay for court and related costs
involving its recalled diet drugs Redux and Pondimin may not be
enough. That charge was taken last year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge is expected to decide whether to give final
approval to a national settlement plan in May.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the failed merger with Warner-Lambert, American
Home in 1998 unsuccessfully attempted a merger with Monsanto. The
company also held negotiations with SmithKline Beecham PLC that
fell apart.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 30
points in today's early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a slim lead over gainers.

   There could well be two stock market sessions today, the one
before the Fed's expected rate hike announcement and the one
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve is
meeting in Washington to decide whether higher interest rates are
needed to keep a lid on inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing opinion is that the Fed will opt for its fifth
rate hike since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of that expected announcement at 2:15 Eastern time,
analysts say stocks should remain fairly well contained.
</P>
<P>
   The market's moves following the announcement could well depend
on the policy statement released by the Fed along with its interest
rate announcement.

   ''Twenty Four Seven'' (Virgin) -- Tina Turner
</P>
<P>
   This disc disappeared from public consciousness about five
minutes after its release, completely on merit. But it's worth
examining why, if only because it's hard not to like and root for
Tina Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's not a songwriter, so she has to depend on her taste and
the talents of others for material. Here, both let her down. The
songs are weary hackwork, the kind where you can frequently guess
the next line and are disappointed when you're right. She needs to
be more adventurous in her choices.
</P>
<P>
   The music is immaculately produced pop, modern and
clean-sounding. But who wants that from Tina Turner? Her advantage
as an artist is that she's lived life, she exudes sass and spirit.
Polite arrangements negate this. Only the title cut, with some
down-and-dirty harmonica, shows some life, and then you have to
wince your way through lines like, ''if lovin' you is a prison, I
don't want parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it time for Turner to leave Europe for the Nutbush city
limits? It wouldn't hurt.

   ''Life'll Kill Ya'' (Artemis) -- Warren Zevon
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this old curmudgeon's still around, and this disc proves
there's some life left in him. Zevon turns his jaundiced eye to
songs about the inevitability of death, Elvis Presley's long fade
and traveling both sides of the mountain of fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are loves songs, too, in a dark and twisted sort of way.
He begs to be taken prisoner by one lover: ''You can treat me like
a dog if you make me feel what others feel.'' In another, he
promises to make a dirty little religion out of loving.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly noteworthy are his stark, scary cover of Stevie
Winwood's ''Back in the High Life Again,'' and another song, where
discretion forbids us from printing the title. Discretion even
prevented Artemis Records from printing the title on the back of
the CD but trust us, the song's there.
</P>
<P>
   Zevon's singing voice isn't what it used to be, and he frankly
could do a better job of covering that up. But his pen is still
mighty, and his old friends will enjoy hearing from it again.

   ''Purpose By Design'' (Verity Records) -- Fred Hammond
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hammond has been at the forefront of the contemporary
gospel scene for years -- as a member of the group Commissioned,
then with his own solo efforts. But it was his 1998 effort, the
two-disc ''Pages of Life,'' that garnered him the most praise and
success based on the strength of such songs as the powerful ''No
Weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his newest album, ''Purpose by Design,'' isn't nearly
as lengthy, it has the potential to be just as successful. Hammond
skillfully mixes traditional gospel and contemporary R&AMP;B in a
well-rounded album that will attract young and old alike.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the R&AMP;B-tinged tracks don't exactly sound like the
type of music played on urban radio today. Rather that delve into
Kirk Franklin's type of music -- often a fusion of hip-hop and
aggressive sampling with a gospel message -- Hammond's flavor is
more the kind that favors strong melody with real instrumentation.
And that works wonderfully on songs like ''Let Me Praise You Now,''
in which the voices of Hammond and his choir ride the uptempo
groove without overpowering it.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs are equally enriching: ''Give Me Clean Heart'' is a
tender, slow track in which Hammond, in his deep, rich voice, asks
God for ''a clean heart, and I will serve nobody but you.'' ''Jesus
Be A Fence'' is a rousing live track that recalls the traditional
gospel songs still sung in churches every Sunday, with solo and
choir performances that demand an encore. You can almost envision
the choir director wildly waving her arms.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the songs recorded in front of a live audience and
where the choir has the strongest presence tend to be the strongest
-- like ''When We Praise'' -- perhaps because they best embody the
church experience.

<HEADLINE> Justices Clarify arbitration Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to have a federal judge confirm or
wipe out an arbitrator's award need not be filed in the court
closest to where the award was made, the Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision in a case from Alabama and Mississippi
resolved a deep split among the nation's federal appeals courts on
a narrow but important point involving disputed arbitrations.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes at a time when an ever-increasing number of
business contracts include provisions that require all disputes to
be settled by arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Arbitration Act says efforts to overturn or confirm
an award ''may'' be filed in the federal judicial district where
the award was made. Today's ruling said that district is only one
of several places such efforts can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case raises the issue of whether the venue provisions of
the Federal Arbitration Act are restrictive, allowing a motion to
confirm, vacate or modify an arbitration award ... only in the
district in which the award was made, or are permissive, permitting
such a motion either where the award was made or in any district
proper under the general venue statute,'' Justice David H. Souter
wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hold the FAA provision permissive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez Byrd Chips Inc. hired an Alabama construction company in
1995 to build a mill in Brookhaven, Miss., for production of wood
chips used in the paper-making industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harbert Construction Co., based in Birmingham, Ala., signed
a $1.3 million contract with Cortez Byrd Chips but later sought to
adjust the sum it was to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The contract-price dispute went to an arbitration panel in
Birmingham, which awarded the construction company an additional
$488,500 for its work.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez Byrd Chips responded by asking a federal judge in
Mississippi to set aside the arbitration award. A week later, Bill
Harbert Construction asked a federal judge in Birmingham to confirm
the award.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for such ''mirror-image'' lawsuits to be
filed in different courts over the same dispute. When it happens,
federal courts generally allow the lawsuit that was filed first to
proceed and dismiss the later-filed lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The general policy gives rise to the so-called ''race to the
courthouse'' by parties locked in a legal dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But J. Foy Guin Jr., a federal trial judge in Birmingham, ruled
that he had the authority to preside over this case despite the
earlier-filed Mississippi lawsuit. ''The place of arbitration
determines the jurisdiction of the court,'' he said, and then ruled
that Bill Harbert Construction was entitled to $274,000 more than
the original contract price, plus interest and costs.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Guin's ruling,
sparking the Supreme Court appeal filed by Cortez Byrd Chips.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision provided a victory for Cortez Byrd Chips by
reversing the appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Cortez Byrd Chips vs. Bill Harbert Construction,
98-1960.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mostly lower today as investors
awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest
rates. Technology stocks led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 72.29 at 10,607.95.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The already slumping
Nasdaq composite index was down 96.54 to 4,513.46, and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.45 at 1,447.18.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MicroStrategy, which lost more than half its market value Monday
after revising downward its financial results for 1998 and 1999,
continued its slide today. Shares fell 15] to 71].
</P>
<P>
   Volume was light as many investors opted to remain on the
sidelines until this afternoon, when the Fed was to announce its
decision on interest rates. Most analysts were anticipating an
increase of a quarter-percentage point, which would be the fifth
such increase since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said most Wall Street traders have already
factored in a modest rate increase, but remained wary about the
possibility that the Fed might raise rates more than a quarter
point.
</P>
<P>
   Central bankers were expected to make their announcement at 2:15
p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 3-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq.
NYSE volume came to 129.80 million shares, slightly ahead of
Monday's pace.

   U.S. Trade Deficit Hits Record
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. monthly trade deficit shot up to a
record $28 billion in January as demand for foreign oil hit an
all-time high while sales of exports slipped. The Commerce
Department said today that the deficit widened by 13.8 percent in
January compared to a $24.6 billion December deficit, stark
evidence that the country began the year with the same weakness in
trade that was exhibited throughout 1999. For all of last year, the
deficit soared to an all-time high of $267.6 billion, 62.9 percent
above the previous record, an imbalance of $164.3 billion in 1998.

   Fed Expected To Boost Rates Today
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is
expected to raise interest rates again today, with an announcement
expected about 2:15 p.m. EST Private economists say the Fed is
prepared to keep boosting interest rates until the speeding economy
slows to a more sustainable pace that's not likely to spark
inflation. The Fed has already raised rates four times since June
1999 in quarter-point steps, boosting the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75 percent.

   Supreme Court: FDA Can't Regulate Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled today that the
government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive
drug. The ruling is a defeat for the Clinton administration's
anti-smoking initiative. The justices said the Food and Drug
Administration overreached when it reversed a decades-old policy in
1996 and sought to crack down on cigarette sales to minors. The
Clinton administration has argued that the best way to cut down on
smoking is to reduce the number of teen-agers who start, and the
1996 initiative was the centerpiece of its anti-smoking efforts.

   BMW Shareholder Denies Sale Rumor

   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- BMW shares rose today on speculation
that the German automaker may have sold its Rover holdings to make
itself a more attractive takeover candidate. But its controlling
shareholder denied BMW was for sale. BMW shares were up 3.75
percent in midday Frankfurt trading. Analysts say a leaner BMW will
be more focused on its core brand of luxury cars and will be a
target for a takeover by one of the global auto industry titans.
Volkswagen has its eye on the company, according to a report today
in the Berliner Zeitung. There was also market speculation that
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. are interested in the
German automaker, or that BMW might be looking to joint forces with
France's Peugeot SA.

have requested a Federal Communications Commission waiver of the
prohibition on one company owning two TV networks. Last Thursday, a
New York State Supreme Court judge let stand a legal provision
Viacom had triggered six weeks ago forcing Chris-Craft to sell out
to Viacom for $5 million or buy the other half of UPN for the same
price. Viacom had to abide by Chris-Craft's decision; yesterday was

<HEADLINE> Shareholders Sue Over Peapod Plunge  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Still scrambling to find enough financing to stay
in business, troubled Internet grocer Peapod Inc. is being sued by
shareholders over a stock swoon that began only last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two New York law firms -- Abbey, Gardy &AMP; Squitieri and Faruqi &AMP;
Faruqi -- filed a class-action complaint in federal district court
in Chicago on behalf of shareholder Lila Gold, charging Peapod and
its top executives with misrepresenting its cash funding needs.
</P>
<P>
   The action says the company ''artificially inflated'' the stock
price in violation of federal regulations, most notably with a Nov.
8 statement that it had sufficient funds to operate into the third
quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More investors are expected to sign onto the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Skokie, Ill.-based Peapod, Paula Wheeler, said
the company had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's stock plunge continued for a fourth day today. After
plummeting 52 percent last Thursday when the chief executive's
abrupt departure caused key financiers to pull an offer of $120
million, it fell 12 percent Monday and another 12 percent in early
trading, sinking 37{ cents to $2.75 a share on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's big problems are traced to the health problems of CEO
Bill Malloy, who informed the company last week he had to leave the
post. Officials close to the company say the 47-year-old Malloy -- a
highly regarded former top executive at AT&AMP;T Wireless Services who
joined Peapod six months ago -- was hospitalized for exhaustion
after marathon talks to try to secure urgently needed financing.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod is the No. 1 Internet grocer in a fledgling field, with
100,000 customers in eight U.S. markets, but like many high-promise
e-commerce businesses it is still striving to turn growth into
profit.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Malloy's illness and the funding withdrawal by
four institutional investors last week, the company said it only
has $3 million cash left and is exploring all options, including a
sale of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Zona Research Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., said Peapod erred by
failing to take advantage of existing services and warehouse
products, as competitor WebVan does. Also, it said, Peapod fell
victim to the huge infrastructure costs of home delivery services,
which even a 20 percent quarterly growth in its customer base
couldn't overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the shakeout in the online grocery business
doesn't mean the industry as a whole is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is absolutely a company-specific event,'' said Barry
Stouffer, an analyst for J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street took a bite out of most Internet grocers'
stocks Monday, Peapod competitor NetGrocer.com, based in North
Brunswick, N.J., received a $30 million infusion in cash from
Italian foodmaker Parmalat SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Chambers, chairman and chief executive of NetGrocer.com,
said the company sees potential for the business both in the United
States and abroad.

   GENEVA (AP) -- For the first time in almost two years, China met
formally with the World Trade Organization's members today to talk

Long Yongtu said. He declined to say how long the membership bid
would take.
</P>
<P>
   China has been trying to join the WTO, the body which sets down
rules on international trade, for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings of the working group on Chinese membership were
suspended in July 1998 because China still had to sign bilateral
agreements on market access with many countries.
</P>
<P>
   Long said China was in the process of reviewing its domestic law
to bring it into conformity with WTO rules. He presented the full
text of 177 laws and regulations concerning China's economic and
trade relations with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the preparations China has done for joining the WTO
clearly demonstrate that the Chinese government has the
determination, confidence as well as capability'' to function in
the WTO, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the bilateral agreements, the WTO working group must
agree on an overall protocol for China's membership.
</P>
<P>
   Long said he did not believe the process towards joining would
be stalled by the U.S. Congress, which has yet to approve the
market-access agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is strongly in favor of Chinese
membership, but many U.S. politicians have said improved trade
relations between the two nations should be dependent on
improvements in China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I firmly believe that the Sino-U.S. trade agreement is in the
interests of the business community. I don't see any reason that
the U.S. Congress would not pass that legislation,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   The working group is expected to meet again in mid-May.

<HEADLINE> Fed Expected To Hike Interest Rates  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is prepared to keep
boosting interest rates until the speeding economy slows to a more
sustainable pace that's not likely to spark inflation, private
economists believe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
raised new worries that too-rapid growth could derail the
record-breaking economy, which is in the 108th month of
uninterrupted growth. Many economists took those remarks as a
signal that higher interest rates would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greenspan is behaving like a track coach,'' said Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI economist David Wyss. ''He is telling us not to blow
out. By running a smooth and steady pace, you can keep going a lot
longer and a lot faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew by a breakneck 6.9 percent annual rate in the
final three months of 1999 and many economists believe growth in
the current quarter will come in around 5 percent, far above the
3.5 percent rate the Fed would like to see at this stage of the
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, many economists predict the central bank is poised
to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point, the fifth rate
increase since June.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee was meeting
today to review interest rate policy. A midafternoon announcement
of its decision was expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has already raised rates four times in quarter-point
steps, boosting the federal funds rate, the interest that banks
charge each other, to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks in turn have increased their prime lending rate
in lockstep with the Fed's moves, pushing the benchmark for
millions of consumer and business loans to 8.75 percent, its
highest level since late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But, thus far, those higher rates have done little to either
slow the economy or its main engine -- consumer spending, which
accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems as though the economy has an incredible head of steam
and the momentum just won't go away,'' said William Cheney, chief
economist for John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has warned in recent speeches that the strong consumer
demand, which he said was being powered by the surge in wealth
created by the stock market, cannot continue to outstrip supply
without triggering serious inflation problems.
</P>
<P>
   To some Fed watchers, Greenspan's warning seemed to indicate the
Fed was aiming its interest rate increases squarely at the
high-flying stock market, prompting some in Congress to question
what business the Fed has in trying to jack up interest rates in
order to make stock prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe Greenspan's comments were misinterpreted and
the point he was trying to make was that strong demand, from
whatever source, needs to moderate in order to keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has been on a wild ride this year, with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average posting huge declines from late January
until last week, when it roared back to life with a 666-point gain
for the week. By late morning the Dow had gained 100 points and the
Nasdaq, continuing a recent losing trend, was down 8.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, even with robust growth, core inflation has remained
tame. Prices at both the wholesale and consumer levels surged in
February, but that was largely due to a big jump in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another rate increase would ''combat any inflation that may be
lurking out there,'' said Richard Yamarone, economist with Argus
Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond today's meeting, many economists are looking for at least
two more rate increases -- at the May 16 meeting and the June 28
meeting -- pushing the funds rate up to 6.5 percent, the highest it
has been since January 1991 when George Bush was in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   After that, many analysts believe the central bank will sit back
and watch how the economy reacts during the summer and fall
presidential campaign.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures edged lower in early
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid more forecasts
for rain in Midwestern growing areas.
</P>

   Corn also sank for a second straight day, with the prospects for
additional moisture further dampening concerns about possible
drought impact on this year's crop.

crop in Kansas and Oklahoma as well as by the forecasts for more
rain in the southern and central Plains.

<HEADLINE> Court says government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as drug  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled today the government
lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug, rejecting
the Clinton administration's main anti-smoking initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling 5-4, the justices said the Food and Drug Administration
overreached when it reversed a decades-old policy in 1996 and
sought to crack down on cigarette sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that Congress has clearly precluded the FDA from
asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products,'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''By no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that
the FDA has sought to address,'' O'Connor said. ''The agency has
amply demonstrated that tobacco use, particularly among children
and adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat
to public health in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, ''It is plain that Congress has not given
the FDA the authority that it seeks to exercise here.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Breyer said the federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act allows the FDA to regulate tobacco. ''Far more than
most, this particular drug and device risks the life-threatening
harms that administrative regulation seeks to rectify,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Smith, spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
said, ''Business and industry throughout the nation ought to
breathe a sigh of relief. The highest court in the land has
confirmed that a federal agency cannot on its own go beyond its
limits of authority set by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had no immediate reaction to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Banzhaf of Action on Smoking and Health, which supported
the government's appeal, said he was disappointed but not surprised
and said the ruling ''will put tremendous pressure on Congress,
especially during an election year, to ensure that nicotine does
not remain the only totally unregulated drug.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, most tobacco stocks gained ground after the
ruling. Philip Morris was up 93} cents at $20.87{ at late morning
on the New York Stock Exchange, where R.J. Reynolds Tobacco was up
43} cents at $16.93}, and Loews, which owns Lorillard, was up
$2.12{ at $47.25. But the U.S. shares of British American Tobacco,
which owns Brown &AMP; Williamson, were down 37{ cents at $$9.87{.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration called the 1996 initiative the FDA's
most important public health and safety effort in the past 50
years. The best way to cut down on smoking is to reduce the number
of teen-agers who start, officials contended.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has been under increasing pressure for
selling a product the American Cancer Society calls the leading
cause of cancer. The Justice Department is suing the industry,
which already has agreed to pay the states $246 billion for the
cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris Co.,
acknowledged last October that smoking is addictive and causes
cancer. The third-biggest company, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, said
in April 1999 that smokers ''are taking significant health risks.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, a Philip Morris Co. executive said the New
York-based company was willing to discuss some government
regulation of the tobacco industry, but that the company still
opposed the FDA's effort to regulate tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said for decades that it lacked authority under a 1938
law to regulate tobacco so long as cigarette makers did not claim
that smoking provided health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But it reversed itself in 1996, saying it could regulate tobacco
because of new evidence that the industry intended its products to
feed consumers' nicotine habits.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states already ban tobacco sales to anyone under 18. In
addition to adopting that as a federal rule, the FDA required
stores to demand photo I.D. from all tobacco purchasers under age
27 and limited vending-machine cigarette sales to adults-only
locations, such as bars.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies sued, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled in 1998 that the FDA could not regulate tobacco. The
court said that decision is up to Congress, which previously has
banned broadcast advertising of tobacco, prohibited smoking on
airlines and required warning labels on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments before the Supreme Court last December,
Solicitor General Seth Waxman said the FDA can regulate tobacco as
a drug because nicotine is ''highly addictive'' and acts as a
stimulant, a sedative and an appetite suppressant, and also feeds
smokers' addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Forty states backed the government's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry's lawyer argued that if FDA regulation
were allowed, the government would be forced to ban tobacco
products because they have not been shown to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's opinion noted that the FDA has concluded that
cigarettes are unsafe and dangerous. As a result, she said, federal
law ''would require the FDA to remove them from the market
entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for
tobacco products within the (federal law's) regulatory scheme,''
she wrote. ''If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic
purpose, and yet they cannot be banned, they simply do not fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said he did not believe the law would require a ban on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the fact that only 2.5 percent of smokers manage to
quit each year ''illustrates a certain reality -- the reality that
the nicotine in cigarettes creates a powerful physiological
addiction flowing from chemically induced changes in the brain.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton on attack over latest police shooting  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In one of her strongest attacks yet, Hillary
Rodham Clinton criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over his handling
of a fatal police shooting, saying he had ''hunkered down, taken
sides and further divided this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Monday she was still waiting for a ''full and fair
investigation'' of the killing Thursday of 26-year-old Patrick
Dorismond during an attempted drug sting outside a midtown
Manhattan bar. He was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, the mayor has not (waited) and that is just
wrong,'' she said, drawing applause from a crowd of about 1,000
people at the Bethel AME Church in Harlem. They cheered
enthusiastically and stood as she arrived late to the tall church
with a horseshoe-shaped balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has led the rush to judgment. That is not real
leadership,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At his press availability today, Giuliani denied Mrs. Clinton's
charges, but gave reporters new details about Dorismond's brushes
with the law, including a March 7 incident in which Dorismond
allegedly punched his girlfriend on the side of the head while she
was holding the couple's 1-year-old child. The girlfriend filed a
domestic incidents report with police, but no charges were filed
against Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am giving you facts that you resist printing,'' Giuliani
said. ''That Mr. Dorismond spent a good deal of his adult life
punching people is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said there ''was no indication'' that the
Dorismond shooting ''had anything to do with race.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were among her strongest direct attacks on
Giuliani, her opponent in an already bitter race for the U.S.
Senate. Until recently, she rarely even mentioned him by name.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was wrong of the mayor to attack Dorismond's
character by releasing his juvenile record, just as it would be
wrong to try to taint the reputations of the police officers
involved by dredging up stains in their past before the facts were
in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should instead be looking for ways to make sure this never,
ever happens again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shooting of Dorismond came just weeks after four
police officers were acquitted of all charges in the fatal police
shooting of Amadou Diallo in February 1999. The officers,
mistakenly thinking Diallo was armed, fired 41 shots, striking him
19 times.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum, in a statement after Clinton's campaign appearance,
recalled that during another stop in Harlem, she referred to the
shooting of Diallo as a murder. She later said she misspoke.
</P>
<P>
   He said her comments Monday were an attempt to score political
points off a tragedy, ''just like she did when she rushed to
judgment and called the police officers involved in the Diallo case
murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she had spoken to police officers unhappy about
some New Yorkers' distrust of them. And she blamed Giuliani for
increasing distrust of police officers by defending them before the
facts are in.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York has a real problem and we all know it. All of us, it
seems, except for the mayor of this city,'' she said. ''When a real
leader would have headed out to heal the wounds, he has chosen
divisiveness.''

<HEADLINE> Bill Brochtrup Gets NYPD Blue Badge  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bill Brochtrup, who plays ''NYPD Blue''
squadroom gatekeeper John Irvin, is talking about the flurry of
script changes often visited on the cast by the drama's exacting
co-creator, David Milch.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brochtrup glances outside his trailer on the Fox studio
lot. ''Oh, there's David,'' Brochtrup says, as a nuanced expression
of got-caught-talking-about-the-boss-but-didn't-say-anything-wrong
flits across his face.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of subtle reaction that makes Brochtrup a standout
on the ABC series although his character is bound to a reception
desk and often on the periphery of the action.
</P>
<P>
   His sidelong glances provide a running commentary -- ''kind of a
Greek chorus,'' as Brochtrup puts it -- on the thugs and sadsacks
who fill the station house. The detectives have bullet-proofed
themselves against tragedy; John Irvin is the innocent who feels it
all.
</P>
<P>
   He moves closer to center stage in Tuesday's episode (10 p.m.
EST), in which detectives Andy Sipowicz and Danny Sorenson (Dennis
Franz, Rick Schroder) investigate a homicide that may involve a
love triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives ''come to John for some advice on a case and he
turns out to be not too bad a junior detective and, I think, earns
a little grudging respect from Sipowicz,'' said Brochtrup.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the actor is more relaxed and assured than his
character (aside from that one Milch-centered blip). After more
than a decade of building a career in TV, film and theater,
Brochtrup, 36, is entitled to confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A third-generation Californian who grew up in Washington, where
his father teaches at Pacific Lutheran University, Brochtrup
studied drama at New York University and then headed back West to
start his career.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his fresh-scrubbed good looks, he was cast as a teen
rapist (twice) and in other odd roles in reality-based court TV
shows. He moved up to a better class of drama with appearances on
''Picket Fences,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and other series.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was and is his passion. Brochtrup's credits include a
starring role last summer in the off-Broadway play ''Snakebit'' and
an award-winning Los Angeles performance in D.H. Lawrence's ''The
Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   But ''NYPD Blue'' is his haven. Milch and series co-creator
Steven Bochco have been his career angels since a Los Angeles play
brought him to their attention six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They hired him for ''NYPD Blue's'' second season, 1994-95, when
Gail O'Grady briefly left her role as receptionist Donna Abandando
to star in a made-for-TV movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''They brought me on as this temp, this gay temp, who was
supposed to be funny for two episodes and go,'' said Brochtrup. He
got conflicting advice about how broadly the role should be played,
but Milch set him straight.
</P>
<P>
   ''David said, 'No, the role isn't flamboyant. He's a real
person. He wouldn't last a day in this squad if he weren't good at
his job,''' Brochtrup recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was bumped to a different precinct job to accommodate
O'Grady's return. Then, in a bit of TV sleight-of-hand, he was
plunked down in another series altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steven called me and said, 'I have a new show coming called
''Public Morals,'' a sitcom, and I love this character (Irvin) and
I think there will be more for him to do on that show.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''They had a going-away party on 'NYPD Blue' and then I arrived
on a sitcom on another channel carrying the same box I left 'NYPD
Blue' with,'' said Brochtrup, who called ''Public Morals'' an
enjoyable if short-lived experience: It was yanked after one
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco then cast him as a different character in the ABC
private-eye drama ''Total Security.'' Brochtrup, an avid card
player, took the gamble. The show also foundered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw David on the lot and he said, 'Well, you want to come
home?' I said, 'Yes.' That's all he said to me. And I knew they
would bring me back to this show,'' Brochtrup said.
</P>
<P>
   Milch's writing is one reason the reunion was sweet, Brochtrup
said. ''He is a perfectionist and tinkers with the material
constantly, but it's always better after he toys with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to play Irvin is another reward. ''NYPD Blue''
has twice been honored by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation in Los Angeles for its gay-character portrayal,
Brochtrup noted.
</P>
<P>
   What he values more is the heterosexual response to the
character Brochtrup calls ''a caring, nurturing, good person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I spent the summer doing 'Snakebit' in New York ... I got
waves from cab drivers and truck drivers and burly, macho guys who
you wouldn't think would be wanting to come up and shake my hand on
the street,'' Brochtrup said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think John is sort of an ambassador to the straight
community.''

<HEADLINE> Students Face Punishment by Opera  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIMANTIC, Conn. (AP) -- Students committing minor infractions
at Eastern Connecticut State University now face punishment by
Puccini. A group of offenders next month will be force-fed a taste
of ''Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Peters, associate dean of student affairs, created a policy
that sends students to an opera or a symphony, rather than slap
them with citations or fines.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said Monday his colleagues initially questioned the
Alternative Restitution Program when it began in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they are sold on it,'' Peters said. ''It's something the
(students) don't want to do, so I feel it is a penalty. But I feel
they are getting something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 50 students have been ordered to attend classical
music performances for minor offenses including violating a campus
ban on alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Peters plans to bring the next batch of
troublemakers to see ''Tosca,'' Giacomo Puccini's tragic opera
about love and betrayal.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Gene Patent Contains Errors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Scientists have found at least four
significant errors in a newly issued patent of a human gene that
plays a role in AIDS infection, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes in the description of the chemical makeup of the
gene raise questions about the rush to patent genes and could
loosen Human Genome Sciences Inc.'s hold on the patent, genetics
experts told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a perfect example of the rush to sequence (human
genes),'' said Christopher Broder, a former member of a National
Institutes of Health team that pioneered work on the gene. ''They
get it wrong. They don't know the function.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the company, based in Rockville, Md., maintained
that in spite of any mistakes in the sequence as described in the
patent application, the patent issued last month will hold up to
legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The patent refers to an actual gene -- not the described sequence
-- in a cell deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we file a patent, we don't claim the sequence as the
invention,'' said William Haseltine, the company's chairman and
chief executive. ''The invention we claim is the gene we deposit
with the ATCC. We know that our sequence and most sequences are not
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, legal experts say the sequencing errors could spell
trouble for the company, which is not connected to the nonprofit
Human Genome Project supported by the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't make the written patent final -- subject,
obviously, to some arrangement for correction if there's a clerical
error -- then the rest of the world doesn't know what is patented,
and that isn't right,'' Stanford Law School professor John Barton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the gene is responsible for the production of a
protein that sits on the surface of a cell and is used by the AIDS
virus as a docking site. Scientists targeted the gene after
learning that people who have defective copies of the gene are
resistant to HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Broder, now on the faculty of the Uniform Services University in
Bethesda, Md., told the Times he discovered the errors in the Human
Genome Sciences patent the day it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Broder said he did a quick comparison of the amino acid building
blocks of the protein described in the company's patent and the
protein that had been filed in a public database. He said he found
that four of the 352 amino acids in the protein were incorrectly
identified.

<HEADLINE> Putin Courts Western Investors  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID McHUGH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Battered foreign investors have pricked up their
ears as Russia's acting President Vladimir Putin talks soothingly
about fixing his country's tarnished business climate and luring
back Western investments.
</P>
<P>
   But while Western companies like what they're hearing from the
man expected to win presidential elections on Sunday, nobody wants
to open their wallets until they see Putin back up his words with
action.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1991 Soviet collapse, many foreign companies have
tried to break into Russia's huge, potentially lucrative market of
146 million people. But instead of profits, most have found
corruption, organized crime and hostile or incompetent bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw for many was the August 1998 financial crash. The
economy stalled and the government defaulted on some of its debts,
leaving foreigners holding $12 billion in frozen treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has created a buzz among foreign businesses with his
pro-investment comments. The government, he said at an investment
forum recently, ''must overcome its weakness in everything touching
on the protection of private property, investors and creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has vowed to get Russia's stalled market reforms moving --
promising to fix the tax system, protect investors' rights, and
clean up corruption. It's a message wary Western companies have
been hearing in Russia for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are relatively high expectations, which we are trying to
keep under control, because expectations are almost never met
here,'' said Scott Blacklin, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Moscow. ''But there clearly is an agenda favoring the
business community.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia desperately needs investment for new factories and
equipment. It should be an investor's dream -- a huge country with
an educated population, cheap labor and abundant natural resources
such as oil, natural gas and timber.
</P>
<P>
   But investors, foreign and Russian, lack essential legal
protections. Much of the economy is still mired in Communist habits
and many officials don't understand about market economics or are
actively hostile to foreign firms. Some Russian businesses accept
Western investments and then refuse to share the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements often can't be enforced by a weak court system where
judges can be bribed. Russian owners sometimes dilute the holdings
of their foreign stake holders by issuing more shares or gutting
the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical experience, U.S. investors bought the formerly
state-owned Lomonosov Porcelain Factory in St. Petersburg, a maker
of luxury goods that was founded in 1744 by a daughter of Peter the
Great, only to see its 1993 privatization overturned in the courts.
An appeals court later reinstated the foreign owners.
</P>
<P>
   Large swaths of the economy are controlled by politically
connected moguls dubbed oligarchs, who got choice state-owned oil
and mining companies for pennies on the dollar in dubious
privatization auctions and then strip them of assets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, capital flows out of Russia, rather than in, at the
pace of a billion dollars a month, according to analysts'
estimates. Russia received just $3.6 billion in direct foreign
investment last year -- roughly what went into the Chinese city of
Shanghai. All of China took in $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Russia market is too big to ignore. Western companies
that have built factories in Russia include construction-equipment
maker Caterpillar, candy and soft drink maker Cadbury Schweppes,
razor-blade and shaving products maker Gillette, and tobacco, food
and beer giant Philip Morris. Most say they are in Russia for the
long haul, banking on future profits to offset steady losses.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have given Putin a vote of confidence on Russia's
fledgling stock market, up 48 percent since he took over. But with
a total value of $36 billion, the stock market is too small to jump
start the economy, caught in a decade-long recession.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies ''have a toe in the water,'' said Blacklin of
the American Chamber of Commerce. ''They could pull their toe back
out if the promise for this government is not fulfilled.''

<HEADLINE> Oscar Delivers Big Bucks to Flicks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The Cider House Rules'' doubled its money.
''American Beauty'' climbed past $100 million. ''The Sixth Sense''
is creeping toward the all-time top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Just what are the Oscars worth? Tens of millions of dollars at
the box office for some top nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Many moviegoers are in their annual Oscar mode, scrambling to
see best-picture contenders and other films with big nominations
before they watch the Academy Awards this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mainstream audiences across the country look for reasons to
see a movie that maybe they haven't felt compelled to see yet,''
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.,
which tracks movie admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oscar nominations are de facto word of mouth from a source
they trust. Rather than a friend saying you've got to go see this
movie, it's the Academy saying, 'Go see it.'''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks pulled ''American Beauty'' from all but a few
theaters the weekend before Oscar nominations came out in
mid-February, with plans to re-release it right after. The movie
received a leading eight nominations, and is now in its its widest
release yet, 1,650 theaters. It has added $28 million to its gross,
hitting $103 million last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' was a record 20th movie released last year
to top $100 million, a figure it probably would not have approached
without its best-picture and other nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to tell you I knew this was going to happen, but
when the movie came out, it would have been difficult for me to
think it would do more than $35 million to $50 million,'' said Jim
Tharp, DreamWorks' head of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller movies also benefit from the Oscars. With acting
nominations for Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny, arthouse favorite
''Boys Don't Cry'' has risen from $3.7 million before the
nominations to $6.8 million as of last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With seven nominations, including one for best picture, ''The
Cider House Rules'' quickly cashed in. In fairly narrow release,
''Cider House'' had grossed just $22.7 million before the
nominations, but distributor Miramax has more than doubled the
theater count to 1,738 since then.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miramax' best-picture contenders last year, ''Shakespeare
in Love'' and ''Life Is Beautiful,'' the Oscar nominations have
helped double the take for ''Cider House'' to $45.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's surprise blockbuster ''The Sixth Sense'' is on the
verge of moving into 10th place all-time at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Disney quadrupled the ghost story's theater count, to about 800,
the weekend before the nominations. Since grabbing six nominations,
including best picture, ''The Sixth Sense'' has rung up an
additional $6.5 million, for a total of $288.5 million. That is
just $1.8 million shy of ''The Empire Strikes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-picture nomination for ''The Green Mile'' has helped
the death row saga add $10 million to its gross, pushing it to
$134.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth best-picture hopeful, ''The Insider,'' is the only
nominee that failed to capitalize. The movie took in a
disappointing $26.7 million before the nominations and has added
just $1.6 million since.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences may have viewed the story of real-life tobacco
whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand and his ''60 Minutes'' interview as
too cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an older demographic that watches '60 Minutes,'''
Dergarabedian said. ''Those viewers will probably wait for the

<HEADLINE> What Is Benefit of Mortgage Broker?  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN ALT POWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm going to be buying a home. What are the advantages of
using a mortgage broker to get my loan?
</P>
<P>
   A: It used to be that the best way to get a mortgage was to
telephone lots of banks and savings and loans to find the ones with
the best terms and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   These days, time-deprived Americans prefer one-stop shopping,
and an estimated 70 percent of all home mortgages now are
originated by mortgage brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage Co. in New
York, one of the nation's largest brokers, says one reason is that
home buyers generally can get a better rate.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers essentially ''buy'' mortgage money from a retail lender
-- at a discount -- and ''sell'' it to a customer. ''A good broker
will give the mortgage for less, or at least equal to, what the
customer would have gotten by going directly to a bank,'' Bader
says.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that brokers can offer a variety of
products, from fixed-rate to adjustable-rate mortgages, from
single-family home loans to special financing for cooperative
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ''A customer would have to make 150 phone calls to determine the
best product on any given day,'' says Bader, whose company writes
$2 billion in residential mortgages a year. ''We've got all that
information in house.''
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary, but Bader says the profit to the broker should be no
more than 1 percent of the mortgage, or $2,000 on a $200,000 loan,
and notes that ''the customer doesn't necessarily pay; it can all
come from the institutional side.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation
of America, says that whether a home buyer decides on a bank or a
broker, it's best to be prepared with facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not every broker is going to give you the best deal,'' he
says. ''The biggest mistake mortgage borrowers make is assuming
that the mortgage broker will shop the market for them, and not all
of them do.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the best deal, Brobeck says, ''you have to do your
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   This includes checking the prevailing interest rate on the
Internet, which can be found at a number of sites, including
Freddie Mac, and in local newspapers, most of which carry such
information at least on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he advises: ''Find at least three to five lenders and call
them up. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. And don't be
afraid to negotiate. Everything is negotiable these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Brobeck also says it's not a bad idea to ask real estate agents
for advice on where to get mortgages. ''Research indicates that
real estate agents will find you a good -- but not necessarily the
best -- rate. Their main interest is in keeping you reasonably happy
and getting you qualified (for a mortgage),'' he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mostly higher on Wall Street today
after a favorable Supreme Court ruling lifted tobacco stocks. Large
technology companies advanced, making up for weakness among smaller
high-tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was calm as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal
Reserve's meeting on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 127.82 at 10,808.06.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 16.56 to 4,593.44, having recovered from an early loss of
more than 100 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 13.54
at 1,470.17.
</P>
<P>
   American Express rose 5[ to 147[, and J.P. Morgan rose 5 5/16 to
128} to lead the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris rose ] to 20 5/16 after the Supreme Court ruled
the government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive
drug. The ruling means that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
cannot regulate tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes, label them
as drugs or dictate how they should be marketed unless Congress
passes specific legislation to allow it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Corp. rose 1 13/16 to 46 15/16 and R.J. Reynolds rose { to
17.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq was pulled lower by a handful of technology companies
that sustained sharp losses.
</P>
<P>
   Protein Design Labs plunged 53[ to 81 after the European Patent
Office revoked the claims of its European humanization patent.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, which lost more than half its market value Monday
after revising downward its financial results for 1998 and 1999,
continued its slide today, falling 11} to 75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors gravitated toward larger technology companies like
Cisco Systems, which rose 4 1/16 to 138 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is continuing to rotate into stocks of higher
capitalization,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist
at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. ''This trend is being used as a defensive
tactic'' in light of investors' growing nervousness over smaller,
unproven technology companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volume was light as many investors opted to remain on the
sidelines until this afternoon, when the Fed was to announce its
decision on interest rates. Most analysts were anticipating an
increase of a quarter-percentage point, which would be the fifth
such increase since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts said most Wall Street traders have already
factored in a modest rate increase, but remained wary about the
possibility that the Fed might raise rates more than a quarter
point.
</P>
<P>
   Central bankers were expected to make their announcement at 2:15
p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues and advancers were nearly even on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 2-to-1 margin on
the Nasdaq. NYSE volume came to 702.75 million shares, slightly

<HEADLINE> Oil Pushes Trade Deficit to Record  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trade deficit climbed to a record $28
billion in January, pushed by a surging oil bill and increased
demand for foreign autos, the government said in a report showing
dramatically that America's trade problems carried over into the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   The January imbalance was 13.8 percent larger than December's
$24.61 billion. Not only did imports increase to a record level but
exports suffered their first setback since last May.
</P>
<P>
   America's deficit with China soared to $6 billion, the largest
for any country, a fact certain to be highlighted by opponents in
the upcoming congressional debate over President Clinton's request
to give China normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Granting China permanent trade relations and entry into the
World Trade Organization will continue to swell our deficit and
undermine our economic security,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown of Ohio,
one of a number of Democrats who have broken with Clinton on the
China question. ''The booming economy is bypassing the American
worker.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration said the January deficit report did offer
some signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   While exports declined, they were still up 8 percent over a year
ago, indicating a rebound in sales as overseas economies emerge
from the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we have turned the corner and we now have a
sustained trend of strengthening exports,'' Commerce Undersecretary
Robert Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   But private economists warned that the deficit for this year is
still likely to worsen from last year's record of $267.6 billion,
reflecting higher oil prices and continued strong U.S. consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fundamentals remain unchanged. Our spending continues to
outpace our production,'' said William Cheney, chief economist for
John Hancock in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For January, imports of foreign petroleum climbed to a record
high of $7.87 billion, more than double the level of a year ago,
when Americans were getting a break from a global slide in crude
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil hit $23.18 per barrel in January, the
highest level since December 1990 and far above the $9.19 per
barrel a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The January deficit of $6 billion with China surpassed the
imbalance with the longtime front-runner in this category, Japan.
America's deficit with Japan actually declined by nearly 20 percent
to $5.58 billion in January although economists cautioned this
improvement may be short-lived given that Japan has apparently
slipped back into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Total U.S. exports dipped 1.8 percent in January to $84.06
billion, still the second-highest level on record, following a
record $85.56 billion in December.
</P>
<P>
   The export decline reflected a drop of $347 million in chemicals
and other industrial supplies, a decrease of $355 million in
semiconductors and a decline of $231 million in consumer goods such
as stereo equipment and household appliances. Analysts said some of
this decline may have reflected pre-buying in December by foreign
firms worried that the year 2000 computer switchover might disrupt
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Imports hit another monthly record of $112.07 billion in
January, up 1.7 percent from December.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was paced by the $919 million increase in oil
imports. Other big increases were in autos, up by $677 million, and
imports of capital goods, including computers and
telecommunications equipment, which climbed by $207 million.
</P>
<P>
   America's deficit with Canada, its biggest trading partner, set
a record of $4.29 billion, up 24.4 percent from December. The
deficit with Mexico, the other partner in the North American Free
Trade Agreement, more than doubled in January to $1.77 billion,
reflecting rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   America's deficit with the 15-nation European Union shrank by
0.9 percent to $3.86 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 106.72; Nasdaq Down 4.23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mostly higher today after the
Federal Reserve confirmed Wall Street's expectations of a modest
interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Fed announced its decision to raise rates by a
quarter-percentage point, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
106.72 at 10,786.96. Just before the announcement, the Dow had been
up 134 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators remained mixed. The Nasdaq composite
index was down 4.23 to 4,605.44, having recovered from a loss of
more than 100 points in early trading. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 11.83 at 1,468.46.
</P>
<P>
   The market's muted reaction stemmed from the widespread
expectations of the rate increase. Today's rate increase, the Fed's
latest strike against inflation, is the fifth since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Fed said future ''risks are weighted mainly toward
conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement does not guarantee that there will be future rate
increases, but it does put financial markets on notice that the Fed
continues to be worried about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks that are most sensitive to inflation led the
Dow's advance. American Express rose 4{ to 146{, and J.P. Morgan

<HEADLINE> BMW Shareholder Denies Sale Rumor  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- BMW shares rose Tuesday on speculation
that the German automaker may have sold its Rover holdings to make
itself a more attractive takeover candidate. But its controlling
shareholder denied BMW was for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose 2.4 euros, or 7.8 percent, to close at 33.10 euros
($32.11) in Frankfurt trading.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say a leaner BMW will be more focused on its core brand
of luxury cars and will be a target for a takeover by one of the
global auto industry titans.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has its eye on the company, according to a report
Tuesday in the Berliner Zeitung. There was also market speculation
that Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. are interested in the
German automaker, or that BMW might be looking to joint forces with
France's Peugeot SA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can understand where these rumors are coming from, because
BMW minus the problem child of Rover is a very prime item that a
lot of people would want to get their hands on,'' said Mark Little,
an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal were to go through, BMW could fetch a price as high as
115 percent of sales -- or $40 billion, Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, General Motors and Peugeot would not comment on what they
termed market rumors.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Quandt family, which owns 48 percent of BMW,
denied it was being primed for sale, saying that the family was not
in talks to sell its stake.
</P>
<P>
   ''One would never sell such a pearl,'' spokesman Thomas Gauly
said. ''Enthusiasm for BMW lives on in the fourth generation of
Quandts.''
</P>
<P>
   He also denied a report in Stern magazine that BMW chairman
Joachim Milberg is about to be fired over his handling of the sales
of the MG and Rover auto units to the British investment group
Alchemy and the sturdy Land Rover business to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion sale of Land Rover remains a mystery to most
analysts, some of whom say BMW needed to offset the $3 billion
write-off from the sale of the Rover and MG cars. The company
denied that too, saying it was focusing on the development of its
own off-road model, the BMW X-5.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it made the sales due to slumping Rover car
sales worsened by a strong pound which made the British-made autos
more expensive to buy in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   BMW said Land Rover failed to turn a profit last year for the
same reasons. That division has long been lauded as a British
success story and analysts praised Ford for adding Land Rover to
its lineup of such luxury cars as Volvo and Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   As for BMW, analysts say the decision on the company's future
independence lies with the Quandt family, which neither needs nor
apparently wants to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''You almost have to be German to understand the enormous
prestige attached to the Quandt family in owning BMW,'' Little
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are wealthy beyond belief and selling it could actually
cause them more problems in trying to figure out where to invest
all that money.''

<HEADLINE> Report Questions Medicare Payments  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government investigation is questioning a
majority of the Medicare payments made over a one-year period for
outpatient rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services' inspector general, in a report
released Tuesday, found that $173 million of the $263 million paid
to outpatient rehabilitation facilities in the year ending June 30,
1998, involved ''unallowable or highly questionable services.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that once the Health Care Financing
Administration, or HCFA, the agency that runs Medicare, granted an
outpatient rehab facility participation in the Medicare program
there is ''minimal accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance shown in the six-state review is ''simply
unacceptable,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, ranking Democrat on
the Appropriations Committee that oversees the Medicare budget.
''We can and must do better for the seniors who rely on such
important services.''
</P>
<P>
   The report highlights a broader problem Medicare has had with
overpayments resulting from poor bookkeeping and oversight.
Government auditors have estimated that Medicare lost $13.5 billion
last year because of fraud, waste and mistakes, about 8 percent of
the amount Medicare paid directly to medical providers.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA Administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, in a statement, said
Medicare had reduced the overall improper payment rate from 14
percent four years ago to 8 percent and that last year the
government recovered nearly $500 million from health care
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   She said the agency has begun an aggressive series of steps to
check outpatient therapy providers and that last year alone
Medicare suspended payments to about 20 facilities that submitted
inappropriate claims.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general agreed that the agency was taking steps to
improve review and recertification procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The six states surveyed -- Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Texas -- represent nearly half the $572
million that HCFA paid for outpatient rehab services nationwide in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Court's Tobacco Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Quotes from the Supreme Court's 5-4 tobacco ruling:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   From Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's majority decision:
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case, we believe that Congress has clearly precluded
the FDA from asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products.
Such authority is inconsistent with the intent that Congress has
expressed in the (Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's) overall regulatory
scheme and in the tobacco-specific legislation that it has enacted
subsequent to the FDCA. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''By no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that
the FDA has sought to address. The agency has amply demonstrated
that tobacco use, particularly among children and adolescents,
poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public health
in the United States. Nonetheless, no matter how important,
conspicuous and controversial the issue ... an administrative
agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be
grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is plain that Congress has not given the FDA the authority
that it seeks to exercise here.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   From Justice Stephen G. Breyer's dissent:
</P>
<P>
   ''The statute's basic purpose -- the protection of public health
-- supports the inclusion of cigarettes within its scope. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''Addiction, sedation, stimulation and weight loss are precisely
the kinds of product effects that the FDA typically reviews and
controls. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that only a handful of those who try to quit smoking
actually succeed illustrates a certain reality -- the reality that
the nicotine in cigarettes creates a powerful physiological
addiction flowing from chemically induced changes in the brain.
Hence, nicotine is a 'drug.' the cigarette that delivers nicotine
to the body is a 'device' and the FDCA's language, read in light of
its basic purpose, permits the FDA to assert the disease-preventing
jurisdiction that the agency now claims.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 135.27; Nasdaq Up 16.12  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mostly higher today after the
Federal Reserve confirmed Wall Street's expectations of a modest
interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 135.27 at 10,815.51. Just before
the announcement, the Dow was up 134 points.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 16.12 at 4,626.12, having recovered from a loss of
more than 100 points in early trading. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 19.04 at 1,475.67.
</P>
<P>
   The market's muted reaction stemmed from the widespread
expectations of the rate increase. Today's rate increase, the Fed's
latest strike against inflation, is the fifth since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said today future ''risks are weighted mainly toward
conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the
foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement does not guarantee there will be future rate
increases, but it does put financial markets on notice that the Fed
remains worried about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central bank's credibility is very high right now,'' said
Chris Conkey, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston. ''The news of an increase was already
factored in, and there's a strong sense that the Fed is on top of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks that are most sensitive to inflation led the
Dow's advance. American Express rose 4 to 146, and J.P. Morgan rose
2 13/16 to 126\.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical companies, which fare best when the economy is strong,
were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a real resurgence in the more cyclical parts of
the market, and that's a strong statement in favor of what the the
Fed is doing,'' Conkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris rose 5/16 to 20\ after the Supreme Court ruled the
government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive
drug. The ruling means that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
cannot regulate tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes, label them
as drugs or dictate how they should be marketed unless Congress
passes specific legislation to allow it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Corp. rose 1} to 46~ and R.J. Reynolds rose 11/16 to 17
3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has slumped in recent sessions as investors
took profits from its sprint to new levels earlier this month,
turned higher on the strength of its largest companies. Cisco
Systems soared 5 to 139[, and Yahoo! rose 9 59/64 to 181 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a handful of Nasdaq stocks posted sharp losses that
prevented the index from bouncing back more convincingly. Protein
Design Labs plunged 51~ to 82\ after the European Patent Office
revoked the claims of its European humanization patent.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, which lost more than half its market value Monday
after revising downward its financial results for 1998 and 1999,
continued its slide today, falling 12} to 74.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is continuing to rotate into stocks of higher
capitalization,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist
at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. ''This trend is being used as a defensive
tactic'' in light of investors' growing nervousness over smaller,
unproven technology companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, decliners led by a 2-to-1
margin. NYSE volume came to 840.63 million shares, slightly ahead
of Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.81 to 543.39.

<HEADLINE> Court To Examine Age Discrimination  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices seemed to disagree
Tuesday over how difficult it should be for employees to prove they
were victims of on-the-job discrimination, or at least to get their
claims before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, expected by late June, in a closely
watched age-bias dispute from Mississippi could carry enormous
practical impact. But a 60-minute argument session bogged down
early as the two principal lawyers repeatedly traded barbs.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Smith of Columbus, Miss., said Roger Reeves' contention
that he wrongly was fired from a job he held for 40 years because
of his age was supported only by ''flimsy, weak'' evidence
amounting to little more than ''surmise and suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Sanderson Plumbing Products in Columbus had
legitimate reasons for the 1995 firing. But Reeves' lawyer, Jim
Wade of Tupelo, called the company's stated reason ''a big lie and
a hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was 57 when fired from his supervisory job at a
toilet-seat manufacturing plant. He invoked the federal Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and sued, and a jury awarded him
$70,000 in damages and $28,490 in back pay.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appeals court threw out that award after ruling
that Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal age
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Anthony M. Kennedy seemed to favor a relatively demanding
standard of proof while Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul
Stevens appeared most sympathetic to Reeves' effort to reinstate
the jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the problem of this case,'' Ginsburg told Smith, the
company's lawyer, as one point. ''It looks like a jury case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to be giving deference to the jury,'' Wade argued.
''Are they just figureheads?'' He said the appeals court ruling was
''totally contrary to the 7th Amendment'' right to a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of employment-bias decisions, the nation's highest
court has imposed various requirements on employees who say they
were treated illegally. Reeves was required to prove he was over 40
and therefore protected by federal law, that he was fired and that
he was replaced with someone younger.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate,
nondiscriminatory reason for the firing. Once it did, the burden
shifted back to Reeves to show that the stated reason was phony.
</P>
<P>
   The jury apparently concluded that he had succeeded in doing
that, but the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Reeves
had to do more than discredit the company's stated reason. He also
had to prove that the company's decision was motivated by age bias,
the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts have differed sharply on that point.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Patricia Millett, siding with Reeves,
argued that the appeals court went too far in ruling that Reeves
could not win his lawsuit without additional evidence of the
company's discriminatory intent.
</P>
<P>
   Putting forward a preliminary case in support of one's claim and
discrediting the employer's defense most often is enough to have
such a lawsuit reach a jury, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing Products, 99-536.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down on Rain Forecast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- New forecasts for more rain in the U.S. winter
wheat belt sent wheat prices plunging Tuesday on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Other grains also declined, while soybeans rose.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices initially dived on prospects for improved
conditions for much of the hard red winter wheat crop. Midday
forecasts for increased precipitation in the central and southern
Plains states accelerated the selloff. Prices fell more than 2
percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
   The same forecasts pushed corn slightly lower, with rain
expected to target the western corn belt -- the driest part of the
Midwest -- next week.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans, meanwhile, bucked the daily trend by inching higher on
the strength of gains in soymeal after commercial funds made large
purchases. Prospects for farmers planting more corn and less
soybeans supported the mild price rise.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 6 cents to $2.60\ a bushel; May corn
fell 3} cents to $2.32 a bushel; May oats fell } cent to $1.20} a
bushel; May soybeans rose 1 cent to $5.26} a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while
pork futures fell.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle rose .25 cent to 72.45 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .17 cent to 83.57 cents a pound; June lean hogs
fell .35 cent to 70.65 cents a pound; May frozen pork bellies fell
2.45 cents to 90.27 cents a pound on rising inventory by
meatpackers.

<HEADLINE> Britain Govt. Plans Spending Boost  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair's government announced
plans Tuesday to boost spending, cut income taxes and offer new
incentives to promote Internet usage in the last full-year budget
before national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury chief Gordon Brown said the buoyant British economy had
turned a projected $4.8 billion deficit into a surplus expected to
be $19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He announced a range of incentives, tax cuts and spending
programs designed to appeal to the governing Labor Party's
traditional working-class supporters, some of whom have been
grumbling about Brown's tightfisted policies.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kennedy, leader of the small Liberal Democrat party,
said the budget gave new meaning to Brown's statement, ''prudence
for a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's spending for a second term,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government must call national elections by May 2002,
although Blair is widely expected to choose an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rate of income tax, paid on earnings up to $42,500 a
year, will be cut from 23 percent to 22 percent, Brown said, adding
that it was the lowest rate in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amid the risks of an uncertain and often unstable global
economy, we are determined to maintain our disciplined approach,
determined not to make the old British mistake of paying ourselves
too much today at the cost of higher interest rates and fewer jobs
tomorrow, determined not to make the old mistake of putting
consumption before investment, the short term before the long
term,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   To promote use of the Internet, he announced a $160 credit to
everyone who files income tax and value-added tax returns
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   In another incentive to get Britain online, Brown said small
business would be entitled to a 100 percent write-off on the
purchase of computers or investments in electronic commerce for the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was in line with market expectations, and the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the day down
just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, said
reductions in public debt had to be set against the 2.5 percent
government spending increase announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may worry markets a little and there's nothing there to
stop the Bank of England from raising rates should they need to,''
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown announced increased government spending of $3.2 billion on
health care, $1.6 billion for education, $445 million for
transportation and $450 million for fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   For the elderly poor, Brown announced a 50 percent increase in
the winter fuel allowance.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced lower taxes on automobiles with engines up to
1200cc, as well as small increases on wine and beer. Cigarette
taxes will be increased 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also announced a cut in capital gains taxes for business
assets, from the current 40 percent to 10 percent over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in April 2001, he said the unemployed would be offered
work, work-based training, work experience or self-employment.
''But no fifth option, no staying at home on benefits doing
nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservative Party,
maintained Brown had been raising taxes and said taxes would go up
again next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chancellor is like a mugger who grabs your money, then
wants you to thank him for giving you bus fare to get home,'' Hague
said.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Lottery Scholarships, Bjt,0375  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's Democratic comptroller cautioned
its Republican governor Tuesday against starting a Lottery-funded
scholarship program for one top senior at every high school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   H. Carl McCall said Gov. George Pataki's ''Leaders of Tomorrow''
scholarship plan needs legislative approval just like any other
proposal involving the appropriation of state funds.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pataki administration to move ahead with the program --
the Lottery Division has funded full-page newspaper advertisements
telling schools they have until March 31 to nominate two candidates
-- is ''irresponsible,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor should not be making promises of scholarships
from an unauthorized program to students and parents,'' McCall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery program calls for recipients -- one senior at each of
the 1,300 high schools in New York -- to get $1,000 a year for up to
four years. The program would cost about $1.3 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Teens must be graduating from high school with a ''B'' average
or higher to qualify for consideration for a scholarship, plus have
showed they are ''well-rounded'' academically, socially and
athletically and are going to attend a public or private college or
trade school in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic state senators this month told Pataki it was
illegal for him to award the scholarships without legislative
approval. They also complained that the qualifications for winners
are imprecise and would lead to the awarding of scholarships on an
inconsistent basis from school to school.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is considered a possible Pataki opponent in 2002,
released an opinion Tuesday from his counsel Randolph Treece which
advised that the Lottery Division is not legally authorized to run
a scholarship program without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery Division also can't legally pay for advertising for
the scholarship program, Treece said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word from the Lottery Division on the
latest attack against the Leaders of Tomorrow program.

<HEADLINE> Africa Rebels To Allow Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's feared former rebel
movement has agreed to remove its roadblocks and allow U.N.
peacekeepers to move freely through the war-ravaged nation, a
senior U.N. official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leader Foday Sankoh and his ally Johnny Paul Koroma, head
of an ousted junta, attended a meeting Monday of the commission
that monitors implementation of the shaky peace accord that
officially ended eight years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The former rebels recognized the U.N. peacekeepers' role in the
West African nation, and agreed to remove their roadblocks within
two weeks, said Bernard Miyet, the U.N. undersecretary general for
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   Miyet, who concluded a three-day visit Tuesday to press for
adherence to the July deal signed in Lome, Togo, met separately
with Sankoh on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The peace deal, which brought the Revolutionary United Front
rebels into a power-sharing government, calls for all warring
factions to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   But many fighters have refused to turn in their weapons.
Cease-fire violations remain common, and the rebels have repeatedly
prevented U.N. troops from moving freely through the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the capacity to react if there is any organized
hostility to our forces,'' Miyet said Tuesday. ''We are not fearful
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front remains in control of much of
eastern Sierra Leone, and human rights organizations have reported
rebels looting villages, burning houses, raping women and
mutilating civilians. The rebels killed tens of thousands of people
in their campaign to gain power in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Pope Visits Historic Jordan Site  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WADI KHARRAR, Jordan (AP) -- ''Father Mohammad,'' a Muslim
archaeologist devoted to digging up Christian roots, cheered louder
than most as Pope John Paul II sanctified the site where, Mohammad
insists, John baptized Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the true Bethany beyond the Jordan,'' he said Tuesday,
beaming, in a brown suede jacket among ecclesiastical colors. ''We
were ignored so many years and suddenly, a pope. It makes you
crazy. Something amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul helicoptered to the ruins of a Byzantine church
unearthed in 1996 a mile from the Jordan. Bareheaded in the
wind-whipped sand, leaning on his tall pilgrim's staff, he climbed
up under a makeshift canopy for prayers.
</P>
<P>
   As the pontiff rode a golf cart past 2,000 seated guests,
officials and hand-picked faithful, children among them surged
forward to see him, overwhelming surprised security guards. He
smiled and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The papal visit lasted only half an hour before Bedouin horsemen
accompanied John Paul back to his helicopter. From there he
shuttled 20 miles to Amman's airport to fly on to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But that was long enough for Mohammad Waheeb, the honorary
''father.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bible said John the Baptist was ''a voice crying in the
wilderness,'' he says, this was the place. As proof to settle a
lingering controversy, he cited not only ancient scriptures but
also nearby church remnants dating back 1,900 years.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, this week the pope will also visit the second
possible baptismal site on the opposite Jordan bank on the Jericho
plain, in the Israeli-held security strip along
Palestinian-controlled land in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Many centuries of tradition hold that Jesus was baptized there
in the river. But Waheeb's Baptism Project, funded by the Jordanian
Tourism Ministry, insists otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could it be that the Christians have been worshipping the
wrong place?'' he said. ''I think so. Belief and tradition are
fine, but I'm a scientist. I need evidence. I need coins. I need
ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul prayed by a 4th-century Byzantine church, with an apse
fashioned from a natural cave. That, Waheeb said, is likely where
John the Baptist lived as a holy hermit, by the fresh waters of
what is now St. John's Spring. An ascetic, John would have shunned
the muddy Jordan, Waheeb said.
</P>
<P>
   No one can fix the baptismal site for certain, he allows. At
least 14 natural springs fed the Wadi Kharrar, an ancient tributary
of the Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But the old texts suggest Jesus crossed the Jordan. Herod
imprisoned John in his Mukawir Palace above the Dead Sea. Salome
danced there for the king who gave her, as she asked, John's head
on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Waheeb found 13 sites, which he says are the remains
of a village near Elija's Hill and the old Roman ford on the
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   None of this came up during the brief papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   Jalal Haddad and his family sat in the front row under an open
tent, more interested in the present. Two of his kids made the big
leagues, he said, attending the morning stadium Mass with their
school. But the minors were just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is so good for us to see the pope very close, to pray with
him,'' said Haddad, a bank manager. ''It is our dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Natali Haddad, 5, was taken with it all, if too shy too speak.
Her brother, Bashar, 3, was confused. In Arabic, the pope is Baba,
the word for father.
</P>
<P>
   ''On TV, they kept calling him Baba, and Bashar thought they
meant me,'' Haddad said.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wound tightly in a scarf, bent and wrinkled from 75
hard years, had traveled since 4:30 a.m. for the mid-afternoon
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt lost, living in a well, but now I am out,'' she said,
turning away only when asked her name. ''Thank God, thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Nuha Kandah, 55, a retired teacher, felt certain that
the pope's weeklong Holy Land pilgrimage would bring together
Palestinians and Israelis. ''He has a pure heart, so God will hear
his prayers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enaya Mango, 48, a Muslim interior designer, was dubious. ''You
know what politicians are like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Sari Aakroush greeted the pope with a Jordanian
flag on a pole taller than he was. He was thrilled by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got to see the pope,'' he repeated, happily, to a passing
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was Christian, Sari replied, ''I don't know. I think
so.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Russian Economic Boost  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday he
aims for the country's troubled economy to expand by 7 to 10
percent per year, during a pre-election visit to one of Russia's
heavy-industry centers.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said bolstering Russia's military-industrial complex
through improved technology and quality control would be a key to
achieving such ambitious, sustained expansion. But he did not give
details on how those goals could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 21st century, any country without a developed economy
and armed forces will be doomed to a dependent existence,'' he said
in a meeting with defense workers in Nizhny Novgorod, about 250
miles east of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of decline, Russia last year recorded economic
growth of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the increase appeared to be largely tied to
Russia's 1998 financial crisis: domestic industries have increased
production because the fall of the ruble put imported goods out of
the reach of many consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has not released a detailed platform on how he would
address Russia's complex economic problems if he wins Sunday's
election. Other candidates, especially Communist Gennady Zyuganov
have criticized his lack of such a program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin remains the front-runner in opinion polls, a
survey released Tuesday showed his margin declining. Putin was
recording support of about 60 percent a few weeks ago, but the new
poll showed him dipping to 48 percent, with Zyuganov rising to 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The other 10 candidates are not expected to be significant
threats and Putin is widely expected to win; analysts say the big
question in the election is whether Putin will get the 50-percent
support necessary to win in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Ultranationalist candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky suggested
Tuesday that Putin could be unseated if his challengers unite
behind a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky said he was willing to withdraw from the race and
back Zyuganov or liberal leader Grigory Yavlinsky -- but said that
neither of them would consider his proposal, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, a minor candidate, Yevgeny Savastyanov, said on
Russia's NTV television that he was withdrawing and urged his
supporters to support Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's visit to Nizhny Novgorod appeared aimed at boosting his
support. He visited an exhibition of local defense industry
products and an automobile factory and his remarks focused on those
industries' conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's fourth-largest weapons exporter, but the
defense industry has been struggling because the cash-strapped
Russian government has reduced arms purchases and has not paid for
some old orders.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also visited the GAZ automobile plant for the announcement
of an investment agreement with Italian automaker Fiat to produce
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential press service announced Tuesday that Putin
signed a decree raising the minimum wage for state workers by 20
percent starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage varies and is far lower than the average
monthly wage made by all Russians, which is approximately $58 a
month.

<HEADLINE> Israel Steps Up Security for Pope  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Hundreds of grim-faced Israeli riot police
stood guard Tuesday like trees along a leafy boulevard, one officer
planted every few steps.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with assault rifles and billy clubs, some holding
bomb-sniffing dogs on a leash, they were deployed along Pope John
Paul II's route from a Jerusalem helipad to the Mount of Olives a
full nine hours before his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is not taking chances with the safety of John Paul, the
most important leader to visit the Jewish state at least since 1977
when the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat flew to Jerusalem in
an astounding peace overture.
</P>
<P>
   With the pontiff, the stakes couldn't be higher. About 1 billion
people, or one-sixth of the world's population, are expected to
closely follow the pope's weeklong Holy Land pilgrimage on
television. Some 2,000 foreign journalists have flown in to cover
the visit -- the largest turnout in the 52-year history of a country
that has known an abundance of dramatic events, from wars to
uprisings to assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon, Israeli coordinator of the pope's
visit, said the Jewish state should make the most of such
unprecedented exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a media event of the first order, even in a country
like Israel,'' he said proudly. ''This is an exceptional
opportunity to present positive things about ourselves and what is
happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a downside.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to share the limelight with the Palestinians,
who hope to use the visit to buttress their claims to independence.
Israeli policemen have climbed trees and electricity poles to
snatch Palestinian flags flying over east Jerusalem, the sector
claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital. On Tuesday, eight
Palestinians were ordered by Israeli police to stay out of the city
for a week for allegedly tearing down Israeli flags and replacing
them with posters of the pope and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Expected attempts by Jewish extremists to stage noisy protests
in the pope's presence also will come under worldwide scrutiny. On
Tuesday, police arrested a resident of the northern town of Tsfat
for conducting a kabbalistic ceremony aimed at bringing about the
pope's death -- the ''pulsa de nura,'' Aramaic for ''bolt of fire.''
The ceremony was broadcast on national television on Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police commissioner, Yehuda Wilk, said 18,000
officers are being deployed during ''Operation Old Friend'' -- the
most massive in Israel's history -- to protect the pope. In
addition, Israel's elite security agency, the Shin Bet, is
deploying all of its resources.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing on everyone's memory is the security breakdown that
occurred with the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, who was shot by a Jewish ultranationalist following a rally
in Tel Aviv. Security officials say they've learned their lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavy police presence for the papal trip, vandals
defaced the pope's helipad in Jerusalem over the weekend. Swastikas
and slogans such as ''Pope Out'' were spraypainted on the tarmac
and the Vatican flag was splashed with red paint.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday morning, access to the helipad was blocked off.
Hundreds of officers from the paramilitary border police lined the
1{-mile route from the helipad to the guesthouse of the Papal
Mission on the Mount of Olives.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said undercover officers will be stationed in the
Old City in east Jerusalem, the site of major Christian shrines the
pope plans to visit, including the Church of the Holy Sepulcher,
Jesus' traditional burial place. An ominous-looking chest-high
metal barrel was set up near the church entrance Tuesday. Police
said the container was to be used in case suspicious objects were
found and needed to be exploded safely.
</P>
<P>
   In another precaution, Jewish extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir was
placed under house arrest for the duration of the pontiff's visit
after he plastered anti-pope posters on the walls of Jerusalem on
Monday. Ben-Gvir said other activists would pick up where he left
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''My friends will demonstrate against the pope,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 227; Nasdaq Up 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices bounded higher today amid growing
confidence that the Federal Reserve is just about done raising
interest rates in its battle with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.10 points to close at
10,907.34 today.
</P>
<P>
   The technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq composite index
benefited most from the Fed's announcement of a quarter-percentage
point increase. The Nasdaq rebounded from an early loss of as much
as 100 points to finish up 100.79 at 4,710.79.
</P>
<P>
   The market gathered momentum after the Fed confirmed Wall
Street's expectation of a quarter-percentage point increase in
short-term interest rates. Today's rate increase, the Fed's latest
strike against inflation, is the fifth since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 37.24 to 1,493.87.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,810 up, 1,161 down and 504
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.05 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 912.92
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.89 to 550.09.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its announcement, the Fed said ''risks are weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement does not guarantee there will be future rate
increases, but it does put financial markets on notice that the Fed
remains worried about inflation. Still, market analysts said that
with scattered evidence that the economy is slowing, investors are
becoming increasingly confident that the Fed's long cycle of rate
increases is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central bank's credibility is very high right now,'' said
Chris Conkey, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston. ''The news of an increase was already
factored in, and there's a strong sense that the Fed is on top of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks that are most sensitive to inflation led the
Dow's advance. American Express and J.P. Morgan rose.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical companies, which fare best when the economy is strong,
were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a real resurgence in the more cyclical parts of
the market, and that's a strong statement in favor of what the the
Fed is doing,'' Conkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris rose after the Supreme Court ruled the government
lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug. The
ruling means that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cannot
regulate tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes, label them as drugs
or dictate how they should be marketed unless Congress passes
specific legislation to allow it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Corp. rose and R.J. Reynolds rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has slumped in recent sessions as investors
took profits from its sprint to new levels earlier this month,
turned higher on the strength of its largest companies. Cisco
Systems and Yahoo! rose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a handful of Nasdaq stocks posted sharp losses that
prevented the index from bouncing back more convincingly. Protein
Design Labs plunged after the European Patent Office revoked the
claims of its European humanization patent.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, which lost more than half its market value Monday
after revising downward its financial results for 1998 and 1999,
continued its slide today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is continuing to rotate into stocks of higher
capitalization,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist
at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. ''This trend is being used as a defensive
tactic'' in light of investors' growing nervousness over smaller,
unproven technology companies, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Accused in Nazi-Era Deaths Unfit  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The trial of an aging doctor accused in
the deaths of nine children in a Nazi-run clinic was suspended
indefinitely Tuesday after he was found to be suffering from
worsening dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's court session was the third attempt to prosecute Dr.
Heinrich Gross, 84, on charges linked to the deaths of thousands of
children killed by the Nazis because they were deemed physically,
mentally or otherwise unfit for Adolf Hitler's vision of a perfect
world.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the suspension about a half hour into the
session, after a court-appointed psychiatrist testified that Gross'
dementia had worsened since two examinations in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Karlheinz Seewald ordered more tests over the next six
months, leaving open the possibility the trial could resume.
However, because dementia worsens with age, it appeared unlikely
that Gross would ever be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I very strongly doubt whether Dr. Gross will ever be deemed
fit to stand trial,'' prosecutor Michael Klackl said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Nazi rule, 75,000 people across Europe, including 5,000
children, were murdered for being mentally or physically
handicapped. Children were killed by injection, medical
experimentation or simply starved. The Nazis called them ''unworthy
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross was put on trial twice before, but the case was thrown out
in 1950 because of legal technicalities and again in the 1980s
because the 30-year statute of limitations on manslaughter had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors filed a new set of charges, accusing him of
complicity to murder in the cases of nine children who allegedly
died as a result of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Gross pleaded innocent, and his lawyer, Nicolaus Lehner, said
Gross was at the war front during the time the nine children were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner has called the trial a politically motivated ''scandal''
at a time when Austria's Nazi past is under intense scrutiny.
Austria's new government includes a far-right party whose leader,
Joerg Haider, has praised the Hitler era.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective witnesses included a survivor of the clinic, Johann
Gross, who is not related to the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Johann Gross recalled the defendant giving him injections as
punishment for trying to escape the institution. ''I would crawl on
my hands, dragging my legs behind me because they were devoid of
sensation,'' Gross said. ''Or I would throw up, again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some infants were left on hospital balconies near his
dormitory overnight in winter. ''I heard them whimpering -- and then
I heard the parents got a letter saying their child had died of
pneumonia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Heinrich Gross became a prominent neurologist,
publishing research based on the preserved brains of children
killed by the Nazis.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Lottery Scholarships, 1st Ld-Writethru,0535  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's Democratic comptroller cautioned
its Republican governor Tuesday against starting a Lottery-funded
scholarship program for one top senior at every high school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   H. Carl McCall said Gov. George Pataki's ''Leaders of Tomorrow''
scholarship plan needs legislative approval just like any other
proposal involving the appropriation of state funds.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pataki administration to move ahead with the program --
the Lottery Division has funded full-page newspaper advertisements
telling schools they have until March 31 to nominate two candidates
-- is ''irresponsible,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor should not be making promises of scholarships
from an unauthorized program to students and parents,'' McCall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery program calls for recipients -- one senior at each of
the 1,300 public and private high schools in New York -- to get
$1,000 a year for up to four years. The program would cost about
$1.3 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he wasn't necessarily against issuing the
scholarships, but favors increases in the state Tuition Assistance
Program grants as a way of helping more high schoolers afford
college.
</P>
<P>
   Teens must be graduating from high school with a ''B'' average
or higher to qualify for consideration for a Leader of Tomorrow
scholarship, plus have showed they are ''well-rounded''
academically, socially and athletically and are going to attend a
public or private college or trade school in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic state senators this month told Pataki it was
illegal for him to award the scholarships without legislative
approval. They also complained that the qualifications for winners
are imprecise and would lead to the awarding of scholarships on an
inconsistent basis from school to school.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is considered a possible Pataki opponent in 2002,
released an opinion Tuesday from his counsel Randolph Treece which
advised that the Lottery Division is not legally authorized to run
a scholarship program without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery Division also can't legally pay for advertising for
the scholarship program, Treece said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery proceeds are supposed to go to aid education in the
state according to the constitution, but Treece said that document
stipulates that revenues go to schools ''as the Legislature may
prescribe,'' according to Treece's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Hayes, a spokesman for the state Lottery Division, said
Leaders of Tomorrow is a ''wonderful'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are clearly supporting education with this,'' Hayes said.
''It is clearly within the New York Lottery's province to execute
such a program and we will continue moving forward with this
program.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Lottery currently funds $15,000 scholarships
to the State University of New York at Albany for outstanding high
schoolers who participate in an ''Expeditions'' program.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Ignore Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Squatters ignored a court deadline
Tuesday to leave the white-owned farms they have seized, and police
have taken no action to evict them, a lawyer for the farmers said.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing standoff between white farmers and the squatters,
mainly veterans of the bush war that ended British colonial rule in
1980, threatened to pit the country's executive branch against the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court in Harare on Friday set a deadline of late Monday
for the squatters to leave their encampments on some 600 white
farms across the country or face arrest and prosecution by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no indication the order has been complied with,''
said Alex Masterson, attorney for the Commercial Farmers' Union.
</P>
<P>
   Masterson said the farmers would request that Police
Commissioner Augustine Chihuri, Home Affairs Minister Dumiso
Dabgengwa and Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of the Zimbabwe war
veterans' group, be held in contempt of court for failing to
enforce or comply with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, they could be jailed for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Masterson said police contingents around the country claimed
they had not received orders from their commanders specifying
action to be taken in line with the court order.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans and their supporters armed with spears, clubs, knives
and guns have marked out and claimed plots on private land, and
many farmers and their families have been forced to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer was treated in a rural hospital Monday after being
struck on the head with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans say they were angered by farmers who opposed the
government's plans to nationalize white-owned properties without
paying compensation to owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 white farmers own about a third of the country's
productive land, while landless rural blacks account for more than
70 percent of the 12.5 million population.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's biggest opposition alliance vowed on Monday to stage
protest marches to force President Robert Mugabe to resign because
of the land occupations, which experts say could threaten crop
production.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report: Miss America winners getting skinnier  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Miss America Pageant winners are
getting skinnier and skinnier, according to research published in
this week's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Using the heights and weights from most of the pageant's 78-year
history, two nutrition experts from Johns Hopkins School of Public
Health concluded many are ''in the range of undernutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Benjamin Caballero, director of the Center for Human
Nutrition at Johns Hopkins, authored the one-page research letter.
He says pageant officials should begin screening out contestants
who are too skinny.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no objection or criticism of the pageant itself.
They're trying to present an image of healthy, positive, they call
it scholarship. It wouldn't be difficult for them to say we want to
promote a message of healthiness on both ends,'' Caballero said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used the height and weight figures to calculate
a measure, called body mass index, and learned that it has
generally fallen over the years. BMI is calculated as weight
divided by the square of height.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as they don't accept anyone that has a BMI in the obesity
range, they shouldn't accept people with BMI in the undernutrition
range,'' Caballero said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, contestants had BMIs in the range now considered
normal, which is 20 to 25, the letter said. But an increasing
number of winners since then have had BMIs under 18.5, which is the
World Health Organization's standard for undernutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The highest index was 22.4 for Miss America 1941, Rosemary
LaPlanche; the lowest, 16.9, for Miss America 1986 Susan Akin. The
height and weight data were unavailable for 1927 to 1933, when the
pageant was not held, and for some of the years since 1990, when
the pageant stopped listing contestants' heights and weights.
</P>
<P>
   JAMA did not publish the heights and weights of the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The lightest, according to The Press of Atlantic City newspaper
archives, was also the first -- 1921's Margaret Gorman, who weighed
108 pounds. The heaviest was Miss America 1952 Colleen Kay
Hutchins, who weighed 143.
</P>
<P>
   Pageant winners, like the rest of the United States population,
have gotten progressively taller. But that doesn't explain the
thinning of Miss America, the JAMA report said. Pageant winners'
height increased less than 2 percent, but body weight decreased by
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The actual influence of pageant competitions on young women's
decisions about diet and lifestyle is not well documented, but it
is likely to have a strong, if indirect, effect,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   One eating disorders expert said the report substantiates what
he has suspected all along.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beauty pageants, like the rest of our media-driven culture,
give young women in particular a message, over and over again, that
it's exceedingly important to be thin to be considered successful
and attractive,'' said Dr. Harry Brandt, director of the Center for
Eating Disorders at St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Robert M. Renneisen Jr., chief executive
officer of the Miss America Organization. He says recent winners
have had some of the highest body mass indices, a reflection of
pageant officials emphasizing brains over beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants' scores in the swimsuit competition count for only
10 percent of their total score, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We long ago made the change from more superficial to more
substantial criteria. We're seeing that, not only in the caliber of
the young women competing but the very data they show here, which
shows that from 1986, even physically, the kind of person is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've overgeneralized this. Maybe Miss America is taking the
lead in changing what the role model for American womanhood should
be,'' Renneisen said.

<HEADLINE> Sylvia Plath's Journals Detailed  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Years before her 1963 suicide, American poet
Sylvia Plath told her psychiatrist that she hated her mother,
blaming her for her father's death -- and the confession made her
feel ''terrific,'' she wrote in diary entries published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries, serialized in London's The Guardian newspaper this
week and due to be published in full for the first time next month,
provide new details about Plath's troubled life and her turbulent
marriage to British poet Ted Hughes. Plath gassed herself in her
kitchen at the age of 30 a few months after Hughes left her for
another woman.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her death in 1963, Plath had just one book
published under her name. But a decade later, she was considered a
feminist martyr, the mourned and beloved author of the ''Ariel''
poems and the novel ''The Bell Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third and final installment of extracts from ''The
Journals of Sylvia Plath,'' The Guardian published Tuesday a long
entry dated Dec. 12, 1958, where Plath wrote about a counseling
session with psychiatrist Dr. Ruth Beuscher.
</P>
<P>
   Describing it as better than ''shock treatment,'' Plath said the
psychiatrist gave her permission to hate her mother. '''I hate her,
doctor.' So I feel terrific,'' Plath wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Plath's mother, Aurelia, raised the writer and her brother,
Warren, after their father died in 1940 from complications brought
on by diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She came home crying like an angel one night and woke me up
and told me Daddy was gone, he was what they called dead, and we'd
never see him again, but the three of us would stick together and
have a jolly life anyhow, to spite his face,'' Plath wrote. ''Me, I
never knew the love of a father, the love of a steady blood-related
man after the age of eight. My mother killed the only man who'd
love me steady through life.''
</P>
<P>
   Plath admitted her mother had a ''lousy life'' and said she felt
pity for her. ''But that is only pity. Not love,'' Plath added.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate her because he wasn't loved by her,'' Plath wrote. ''He
was an ogre. But I miss him. He was old, but she married an old man
to be my father. It was her fault. Damn her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   According to her journals, the counseling session also explored
Plath's relationship with Hughes, whom she met at Cambridge
University in England and married in 1956. After her death, Hughes,
who later became Britain's poet laureate, was demonized by some
Plath fans. His name was even chipped off her tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   After saying little about their marriage, Hughes died from
cancer in 1998. Only months before his death, he published
''Birthday Letters,'' a poetic -- and often touching -- account of
their relationship that has led many to re-evaluate the famous
pair.
</P>
<P>
   Plath wrote that her psychiatrist asked if she would have the
''guts to admit you'd made a wrong choice?''
</P>
<P>
   ''In a husband. I would,'' Plath said. ''But nothing in me gets
scared or worried at this question. I feel good with my husband ...
What is only pieces, doled out here and there to this boy and that
boy, that made me like pieces of them, is all jammed together in my
husband. So I don't want to look around any more: I don't need to
look around for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian's extracts conclude with the last line from Plath's
surviving journals. Dated Nov. 15, 1959, Plath wrote: ''A bad day.
A bad time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her last journal, which Plath kept until three days before her
death, was destroyed by Hughes, who said he did not want their
children to have to read it.
</P>
<P>
   After Plath's death, Hughes maintained control over her journals
and permitted only a much-edited version to be published in 1982.
The couple's children are now permitting publication of the
complete diaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Journals of Sylvia Plath,'' edited by Karen V. Kukil, will
be published on April 3.

<HEADLINE> UN: US Used Uranium Ammo in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- U.S. jets used 31,000 depleted uranium rounds --
about 10 tons of the munitions -- during the Kosovo war, a U.N. task
force said Tuesday, citing confirmation by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists believe the rounds, which have been used as far
back as the Persian Gulf War, are environmentally harmful,
especially when people and animals inhale the dust that forms when
the shells disintegrate on impact.
</P>
<P>
   Target zones hit by depleted uranium -- known as DU -- should be
marked and children kept away from them, said Pekka Haavisto, head
of the U.N. Environment Program's Balkans Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Haavisto said NATO's confirmation that it used DU should not
cause alarm, but conceded scientific knowledge of its effects is
limited. He said he was unable to estimate the number of people
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy that this spring we have got finally from NATO
the information, but we would have been more happy if we could have
had this information already last summer,'' Haavisto said.
</P>
<P>
   A set of NATO maps of areas where the munitions were used ''is
not precise enough to make field assessments,'' Haavisto said. He
noted that U.N. experts last year carried out measurements in
Kosovo, but found nothing because the exact locations were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Air Force Lt. Col. Vic Warzinski said the
figure of 31,000 depleted uranium rounds is the Pentagon's best
estimate, and that the ammunition was fired by A-10 aircraft in
attacks on Serb armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the ammunition's
use did not violate any international conventions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the U.S. Defense Department has robustly defended
the use of depleted uranium -- a dense metal which provides enhanced
armor-piercing capability -- saying the rounds pose no more health
risk than conventional anti-tank weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The U. N. task force said the World Health Organization was
preparing a general report on the health effects of depleted
uranium and that the Royal Society, Britain's academy of science,
was producing its own independent study.
</P>
<P>
   NATO secretary-general Lord Robertson wrote to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Feb. 7, acknowledging that DU
rounds were used during last spring's air campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ammunition was part of the A-10's standard load,
meaning that they were used throughout Kosovo on about 100
missions.
</P>
<P>
   The major focus of the operations was an area west of the
Pec-Dakovica-Prizren highway, in the areas surrounding Klina and
Prizren and north of a line between Suva Reka and Urosevac,
Robertson said. But he added that many missions used DU in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The round, Robertson said, uses a byproduct of the uranium
refining process.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Govt., Jews Reach Settlement  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The Dutch government said Tuesday
it had agreed to give the Jewish community $180 million to
compensate for injustices they suffered in Holland after returning
from Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement followed protests from Dutch Jews that an earlier
offer of $114 million -- which the government called its ''moral
obligation'' -- fell far short of real redress for misappropriated
Jewish assets.
</P>
<P>
   The government also earmarked $114 million for Dutch victims of
Japanese World War II prison camps in the former East Indies
colony, now Indonesia, and $14 million for Dutch Gypsies persecuted
by the Nazis, the Finance Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are happy that this settlement has been reached,'' said
Ronni Naftaniel, a spokesman for the Central Jewish Council, which
negotiated the settlement with Finance Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry spokesman Jeroen Sprengers said the government
increased the offer because ''it was convinced by the arguments
that were put forth by the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   Naftaniel said the agreement covers 15 types of assets,
including administrative costs for returned Jewish property and
money confiscated from Jews by the Nazi puppet regime to run
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the payment will go to Dutch Jewish war
victims, most of whom live in the Netherlands, Israel and the
United States. Naftaniel said the council will contribute $23
million to an international fund for war victims.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement followed a series of investigations into the
treatment of Jews and other Nazi victims, exposing the neglect of
their suffering and the plundering of assets following the
Netherlands' liberation from German occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the Netherlands' prewar population of 140,000 Jews, more
than 100,000 died in Nazi death camps during World War II or on the
trains taking them there.

<HEADLINE> Montserrat Volcano Erupts With Fury  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Montserrat (AP) -- After scientists announced in 1998 that
Montserrat's Soufriere Hills volcano had ended a three-year
eruption, weary islanders looked forward to moving back.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists were wrong. In November, after months of
silence, the volcano began spewing molten rock. And late Monday it
briefly exploded, thrusting glowing rock and a thundering ash cloud
six miles high.
</P>
<P>
   ''This volcano likes to give us surprises,'' Gill Norton,
director of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory, said before
Monday's explosion. ''The longer the quiet went on, the more
certain we were that we had seen the end. But apparently it wasn't
done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soufriere Hills' reawakening is yet another blow to
Montserrat, a British Caribbean territory that saw its capital,
Plymouth, destroyed by the volcano in 1997. It has been slowly
rebuilding in a northern ''safe zone'' about five miles away from
the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's explosion, islanders greeted the new
activity with resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought by this time I would be going back to my house, but
that dream is now far off in the distance, I guess,'' said Kenneth
Lee, a 54-year-old tax inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say more molten rock will produce more explosions,
ash clouds and avalanches of fiery rock and gases called
pyroclastic flows. One avalanche killed 19 people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get back to that height again, there's no way I'm
staying,'' said William Taylor, who runs a car rental business.
''There's no way I'm going through that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Montserrat once was a relatively prosperous island with a strong
offshore banking industry, a medical school, light manufacturing
and tourism fueled by wealthy foreigners who built villas in its
verdant hills and spring-fed forests.
</P>
<P>
   When the volcano roared to life in 1995 after 400 years of
quiet, it spread blankets of ash over the island and followed up
with pyroclastic flows that raced into the sea. Montserrat's
population shrank from 11,000 to 4,000 as residents left.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged eruption brought a host of ills. Burglars looted
the vault of the abandoned Barclay's Bank. The island's airport and
pier closed. Insurance companies fled, and without insurance,
residents couldn't build new homes. Plymouth, with its new
hospital, government building and tourist markets, became a ghost
town of blasted buildings and melted windowpanes. Acidic ash
devours metal roofs and swallows all sound in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The new threat comes just as islanders were rebuilding. The
government constructed 200 concrete homes and closed crowded
emergency shelters. A new hospital and 18-room hotel have opened.
</P>
<P>
   British Gov. Anthony Abbott convinced a few insurance companies
to return, and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank agreed to honor
Montserratian cash again after police caught the Barclay's Bank
burglars.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still few jobs, despite a British government offer
of $56,000 to any company willing to return to the island.
</P>
<P>
   The local government is lobbying Britain for a new airport and
easier terms for a mortgage program to enable islanders to build
homes. Many residents are still paying mortgages on homes in an
off-limits zone near the volcano while trying to meet rent payments
in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 100 Montserratians abroad have taken up a British
offer to pay their air fare home. Many are simply unwilling to live
with the sticky gray ash, said Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ''This new growth in the volcano is massively demoralizing,'' he
said. ''I fear that if ashing starts, some of those tremendously
resilient people who have put up with this volcano for years are
just going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Some -- like retired Michigan lawyer Robert Kleeb -- say they will
stay no matter what. He and his wife have ignored government pleas
to abandon their villa near the volcano's lower slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually this will stop and the people will come back,''
Kleeb said as he watched a workman install a new curb along his
driveway as the volcano smoked away across the valley. ''This
eruption won't last forever.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Last of Rebels Purged  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- The Russian military command
claimed complete control Tuesday over a Chechen village nearly
destroyed by weeks of battles -- but soldiers entrenched on the
outskirts still told of shootings and nighttime raids by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week battle for the southern village of Komsomolskoye
has reduced nearly every house to ruins and highlighted the
difficulty Russia will have trying to control Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past weeks and months, rebels have been moving and
regrouping, occasionally slipping through Russian positions and
seizing villages. The militants then prove extremely hard to
remove, withstanding waves of air raids and attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The federal command said that final efforts to purge the rebels
from Komsomolskoye ended Tuesday, and a Russian flag has been
raised over the village.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian troops were entrenched on the outskirts and told of
nighttime movements by rebel groups, and attacks of sniper fire,
according to footage shown on Russia's NTV television station.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying, we are applying all our strength, but this is a
difficult process,'' Grigory Fomenko, a commander of Interior
Ministry troops, told NTV.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't put soldiers holding hands all around the village,
and surround the village like that,'' he said. ''We can't stand in
front of every house.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal command conceded there were still straggling rebels
inside the Russian encirclement that surrounds Komsomolskoye, but
the village itself is now safe, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's presidential spokesman on Chechnya, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, said Tuesday that Moscow worried about new surprise
attacks by rebels ahead of Sunday's Russian presidential election,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''A strike in the back should be expected in Chechnya ahead of
the presidential election,'' Yastrzhembsky said. ''We must be ready
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal command said 500-600 rebels and 50 Russian soldiers
had been killed during the fighting from Komsomolskoye, which saw
the village's entire population flee as their houses were bombed
and shelled. The casualty claims could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Interfax, a military spokesman said scores of
rebels surrendered in Komsomolskoye on Tuesday morning, a day after
federal forces raised the Russian flag over the village.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender came after acting President Vladimir Putin said he
would consider talking with rebels in Chechnya, but only if they
give up their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, NTV reported that several Russian officers have
been arrested on suspicion of selling Grad rockets to the Chechen
rebels. The report did not say when the arrests were made, but said
the officers were seized with a shipment of 180 rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense and Interior Ministries had no immediate comment on
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The war has sent an estimated 250,000 Chechens fleeing their
homes, with many of them ending up in refugee camps in the
neighboring republic of Ingushetia, where they complain of poor
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day we do not know what to expect. We are nervous,''
said Adam Madayev, a refugee in the Sputnik camp near
Sleptsovskaya.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union announced Tuesday it would donate 3,300 tons
of meat and 1,100 tons of rice to refugees and host families in
Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in September, after
rebels invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last
summer. Russia now controls most of Chechnya, but hasn't been able
to defeat rebels in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the arrests, rebels have said they will not quit
fighting and have ambushed Russian troops far behind the front
lines in recent weeks, inflicting heavy casualties.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Holds Presidential Primary  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- For many Illinois voters, Tuesday's presidential
primary was an exercise in democracy -- a chance to support their
candidate in a state that will be important in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore already have won
enough convention delegates to become the presumptive nominees, so
it was mostly dedicated supporters who went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Voter Roger Fisher of Champaign said he didn't care that the
presidential nomination fight was already settled for both parties,
''because I'm for Bush anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's healthy economy under the Clinton-Gore
administration helped the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel satisfied,'' said Gore supporter Linda Hall, 45, of Oak
Park. ''I have more money now than ever before, so I want to keep
the Democrats in.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bush visited Illinois ahead of the primary -- the
vice president on Monday and the Texas governor last week, moving
to build support ahead of Election Day in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general election has started, although it may be a little
early for voters,'' said Pete Giangreco, a consultant to the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters missed vanquished hopefuls Democrat Bill Bradley and
Republican John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not excited about either of them (Gore and Bush), but my
only choice is Gore,'' said retired teacher Elinor Najita, 63, as
she voted in Chicago for the vice president. ''I thought it was
going to be exciting, but it ended too soon. Now, it's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary determines whose delegates go to the political
conventions this summer. There were 161 Democratic delegates at
stake Tuesday, and 74 for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If voters send Bradley or McCain delegates to the conventions,
they may be able to affect the parties' platforms on such issues as
health care or campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, with its mix of races and cultures and economic
conditions, has a history of mirroring the nation and backing the
winning presidential candidate. The only recent exception was in
1976, when Illinois went for Gerald Ford instead of Jimmy Carter.

<HEADLINE> Nabisco to sell ice cream cones outside supermarket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Nabisco ice cream cones are coming out
of the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The snack food giant said Tuesday it plans to sell the Comet and
Oreo ice cream cones to food service vendors, following the
bankruptcy Ace Baking Co., of Green Bay, Wis., the nation's largest
cone maker.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco said its sells about 90 million cones a year, or $15
million, in the nation's supermarkets. The company plans to
increase its capacity this year to an additional 225 million cones
to meet food service vendors' demands, spokeswoman Ann Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the company, which makes Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies
and Ritz crackers, will make cones on demand from vendors. She
could not say how many orders the company had received so far.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, another cookie maker, Keebler Co. won the
right to buy the cone-manufacturing assets of Ace Baking for $6.5
million at a bankruptcy court auction in Wisconsin. Keebler, of
Elmhurst, Ill., has said it should be able to avert any shortage of
cones.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Test Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a new delay in testing, the Pentagon
said Tuesday it still will be able to tell President Clinton this
summer whether its anti-missile system is technically ready to be
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, said Clinton may wait as late as
autumn before deciding to commit the country to deploying missile
defenses. That would give him more time to work with Moscow on arms
control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, told a Pentagon news conference that
the next test of the anti-missile system will be June 26, two
months later than originally planned. The delay gives the Pentagon
time to fix a problem that caused a January test to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Pentagon had said it would make an assessment in
June of the system's readiness to deploy. Because the next test has
been delayed until June, the assessment will be done in July,
Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment in July will be done after 30 days of analysis of
the June test results -- half the time that Kadish's office has
taken to analyze the results of previous tests. Only 85 percent of
the data from the June test will be available for consideration by
July, but that will be sufficient, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged Tuesday that the Pentagon was cutting corners in
order to meet a politically driven timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a rush decision,'' said Stephen Young, deputy director
of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an advocacy group that
believes there is little rationale for erecting a national missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The June test will cost about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The July review will still leave Clinton time to decide, by
October or November, whether to proceed with deployment -- a
decision fraught with political peril, including implications for
Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to wait beyond November, the Pentagon could not
remain on track to completing the construction required at bases in
Alaska in order to have the anti-missile system operating by the
target date of 2005, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has required the Pentagon to deploy a national defense
against long-range missiles as soon as technically feasible.
Clinton has said that in addition to the technical feasibility, he
will take into consideration the financial cost, the level of
threat of missile attack on the United States, and the impact on
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russia and China are strongly opposed to a U.S. national
missile system, which is prohibited by the 1972 Anti-ballistic
Missile treaty. The Clinton administration wants to amend the
treaty to permit such defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- are urging
Clinton to leave the deployment decision to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish said he remains confident that the Pentagon can make an
informed recommendation this summer, despite the test schedule
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We assess ourselves to be just about on the schedule we need
to be on to deploy this system in 2005,'' Kadish said. He added,
however, ''If we have a particular problem that results in a
significant (further) delay, we're going to have to tell people we
can't make our end date.''
</P>
<P>
   The missile defense system would use a network of radars and
interceptor missiles based in Alaska to detect, track and shoot
down long-range ballistic missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Court: FDA Can't Regulate Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government lacks authority to regulate
tobacco as an addictive drug even though tobacco use may be ''the
single most significant threat to public health,'' the Supreme
Court said Tuesday, throwing out the Clinton administration's main
anti-smoking initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling, a victory for an industry under pressure from
numerous lawsuits, said Congress did not authorize the Food and
Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. President Clinton and
others immediately said Congress should pass a law letting the FDA
reinstate its rules cracking down on cigarette sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are to protect our children from the harms of tobacco,
Congress must now enact the provisions of the FDA rule,'' Clinton
said in a statement issued while he was traveling in India.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Smith, spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
welcomed the ruling. ''Business and industry throughout the nation
ought to breathe a sigh of relief. The highest court in the land
has confirmed that a federal agency cannot on its own go beyond its
limits of authority set by Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said, ''By
no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that the FDA
has sought to address.'' She said, ''The agency has amply
demonstrated that tobacco use, particularly among children and
adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to
public health in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ''We believe that Congress has clearly
precluded the FDA from asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco
products.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has been under increasing pressure for
selling a product the American Cancer Society calls the leading
cause of cancer. Cancer society head John R. Seffrin said he was
disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also has a lawsuit pending against the
industry, which has agreed to pay the states $246 billion for the
cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. Cigarette billboards
around the country were taken down last year as part of that
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Writing for the four,
Breyer said the 1938 federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's ''basic
purpose -- the protection of public health -- supports the inclusion
of cigarettes within its scope.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling throws out the FDA's rule requiring convenience
stores and other places that sell cigarettes to require
identification from anyone under age 27 seeking to buy tobacco
products.
</P>
<P>
   Other FDA rules put on hold earlier would have limited
vending-machine cigarette sales to adults-only locations, such as
bars, and would have limited cigarette advertising. All 50 states
already ban tobacco sales to anyone under 18, and the FDA adopted
that rule nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, ''I ask the convenience stores, I
ask our drug stores, I ask our gas stations, other places where
kids can buy cigarettes to not pull back. ... I urge this community
to keep the cigarettes behind the counter, to keep that ID check
sign up'' while lawmakers push for federal legislation allowing FDA
regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and several Democratic members of
Congress also called for such legislation. Attorney General Janet
Reno said, ''Nobody can reasonably question the fact that tobacco
is harmful to children and nobody should reasonably question these
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said some people
will want to give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco but ''I'm
not one of those. ... I don't think they do a very good job with
what they're doing.'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,
added, ''I'm not anxious to extend the power and authority to the
FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks gained ground after the ruling. Philip Morris
rose 31\ cents to $20.25 on the New York Stock Exchange; Loews
Corp., parent of Lorillard Tobacco Co., rose $2 to $47.12{ and R.J.
Reynolds rose 56\ cents to $17.06\. But the U.S. shares of British
American Tobacco, which owns Brown &AMP; Williamson, were down 62{
cents at $9.62{.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris Co., said
last October that it acknowledged smoking is addictive and causes
cancer. Company executive Mark Berlind on Tuesday repeated the
company's position that it was willing to discuss some government
regulation, perhaps regarding ingredient labeling or efforts to
combat youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called the 1996 initiative the
FDA's most important public health and safety effort in the past 50
years. The best way to cut down on smoking is to reduce the number
of teen-agers who start, officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said for decades that it lacked authority to regulate
tobacco so long as cigarette makers did not claim that smoking
provided health benefits. But it reversed itself in 1996, citing
new evidence that the industry intended its products to feed
consumers' nicotine habits.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies sued, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled in 1998 that Congress did not authorize the FDA to
regulate tobacco.

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Lottery Scholarships, 2nd Ld-Writethru,0535  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's Democratic comptroller cautioned
its Republican governor Tuesday against starting a Lottery-funded
scholarship program for one top senior at every high school in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   H. Carl McCall said Gov. George Pataki's ''Leaders of Tomorrow''
scholarship plan needs legislative approval just like any other
proposal involving the appropriation of state funds.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pataki administration to move ahead with the program --
the Lottery Division has funded full-page newspaper advertisements
telling schools they have until March 31 to nominate two candidates
-- is ''irresponsible,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor should not be making promises of scholarships
from an unauthorized program to students and parents,'' McCall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery program calls for recipients -- one senior at each of
the 1,300 public and private high schools in New York -- to get
$1,000 a year for up to four years. The program would cost about
$1.3 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he wasn't necessarily against issuing the
scholarships, but favors increases in the state Tuition Assistance
Program grants as a way of helping more high schoolers afford
college.
</P>
<P>
   Teens must be graduating from high school with a ''B'' average
or higher to qualify for consideration for a ''Leaders of
Tomorrow'' scholarship, plus have showed they are ''well-rounded''
academically, socially and athletically and are going to attend a
public or private college or trade school in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democratic state senators this month told Pataki it was
illegal for him to award the scholarships without legislative
approval. They also complained that the qualifications for winners
are imprecise and would lead to the awarding of scholarships on an
inconsistent basis from school to school.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who is considered a possible Pataki opponent in 2002,
released an opinion Tuesday from his counsel Randolph Treece which
advised that the Lottery Division is not legally authorized to run
a scholarship program without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery Division also can't legally pay for advertising for
the scholarship program, Treece said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery proceeds are supposed to go to aid education in the
state according to the constitution, but Treece said that document
stipulates that revenues go to schools ''as the Legislature may
prescribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Hayes, a spokesman for the state Lottery Division, said
''Leaders of Tomorrow'' is a ''wonderful'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are clearly supporting education with this,'' Hayes said.
''It is clearly within the New York Lottery's province to execute
such a program and we will continue moving forward with this
program.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the Lottery currently funds $15,000 scholarships
to the State University of New York at Albany for outstanding high
schoolers who participate in an ''Expeditions'' program.

<HEADLINE> CIA: U.S. Vulnerable to Surprise  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Try as it might to know what's going on in the
world, the Central Intelligence Agency is more vulnerable than ever
to surprise, Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the rapid spread of new technologies and a greater
ability to deceive the world on the part of countries that spread
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than ever, we risk substantial surprise,'' Tenet told a
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on weapons
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not for lack of effort on the part of the intelligence
community. It results from significant effort on the part of
proliferators.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said efforts to halt proliferation of weapons are
complicated because most programs to make weapons of mass
destruction are based on technologies that have dual use -- that is,
can be used for civilian as well as military applications.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony about the types of weapons threat the U.S. faces
and a review of various regions of the world, Tenet also said:
</P>
<P>
   --Over the next 15 years, our cities will face ballistic missile
threats from a wider variety of actors -- ''North Korea, probably
Iran, possibly Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   --The proliferation of medium-range ballistic missiles, driven
primarily by North Korean sales, is significantly altering
strategic balances in the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   --Russia and China have improved their nonproliferation policies.
But ''little positive can be said about North Korea, the third
major global proliferator, whose incentive to engage in such
behavior increases as it economy continues to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   --The CIA has identified ''well over 50 states that are of
concern as suppliers, conduits or potential proliferators.''
</P>
<P>
   --Although 1999 did not witness the kind of dramatic terrorist
attacks that 1998 did, the U.S. ''profile in the world and thus our
attraction as a terrorist target will not diminish any time soon.''

<HEADLINE> Dems Urge Gun Law Enforcement  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday offered
legislation they say would bolster enforcement of gun laws by
hiring new federal agents and prosecutors and creating a national
database of ''ballistic fingerprints.''
</P>
<P>
   The package of bills dubbed ENFORCE is based partly on proposals
President Clinton advanced in his State of the Union address in
January. It also was presented as an answer to the National Rifle
Association's frequent argument that if enforcement of existing gun
laws improved, new laws would not be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill puts the NRA's sincerity to the test,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, author of the Brady bill requiring background checks
for gun purchasers, was joined by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a New York
Democrat whose husband was killed by a gunman on a Long Island
commuter train, and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The $300 million package would add 500 new inspectors and agents
to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and hire 1,000
local prosecutors and 100 federal prosecutors to handle gun law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   It also would fund so-called ''smart gun'' technology that only
allows guns to be fired by their owners. And it would create a
national ballistics database, referred to by some as gun
''fingerprinting.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a database would require that a gun's unique barrel
markings be kept on file so it could be matched to shell casings
and bullets found at crime scenes. Republican Gov. George Pataki
has proposed such a database for New York.
</P>
<P>
   NRA spokesman William Powers said he could not comment on
specifics of the bill because he had not seen it. But he said if
additional federal agents were hired and earmarked for
''zero-tolerance'' efforts to keep guns out of the hands of violent
felons, the NRA could be supportive.
</P>
<P>
   The package also would close what the Democratic lawmakers
referred to as loopholes in some existing laws, such as one that
allows some violent felons to have their gun rights restored after
being released from prison. And it would increase from one to four
the number of annual unannounced inspections ATF agents could make
at a gun dealer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives our law enforcement and prosecutors the tools they
need to go after bad dealers,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Stratman, a spokesman for House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, R-Ill, said while Hyde wants to pass a gun control bill
this year, the Democrats' measure was little more than
''posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratman said Republicans plan to introduce legislation
Wednesday to nationalize a pilot program called Project Exile.
Operating in Richmond, Va. and Rochester, N.Y., it mandates stiff
jail terms for any felon caught with a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been wrestling with gun control legislation for
more than a year, spurred in part by deadly shootings at schools.
Lawmakers failed to reach a compromise last year on a bill that
would have required guns to be sold with childproof trigger locks
and mandated background checks for people purchasing weapons at gun
shows. President Clinton recently urged lawmakers to convene a
conference committee to work out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates won a major victory last week when the
nation's largest gun manufacturer, Smith &AMP; Wesson, agreed to
install safety locks on its handguns and develop ''smart gun''
technology.

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Custody Case Set  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A woman accused of leaving her 6-year-old
son in a ''flophouse'' where police say he got a gun used to kill a
classmate will stand trial on a child neglect charge, a judge ruled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tamarla Owens, 29, asked for a non-jury trial, which will
determine if she will regain custody of the boy, her 8-year-old son
and 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Independence Agency brought the neglect complaint and
challenged her custody of the children after the Feb. 29 shooting
of 6-year-old Kayla Rolland at Buell Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' sister was given temporary custody and will keep the
three children until the trial, which was set for May 3. If the
court is given jurisdiction, the agency could seek to terminate
Owens' parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Arthur A. Busch wants the court to be able to direct
evaluations and counseling for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the serious matter here is helping this little boy and
his little brother and sister. We were hoping the mother would work
with us,'' Busch said after Tuesday's hearing. ''They want their
dirty laundry hung out there for all the public to see and we'll do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens and her husband, Dedric Owens, who is in jail on an
unrelated probation violation, were charged with child neglect
after the shooting. A date for him was not set because he is in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Independence Agency petition alleges that the mother
allowed her sons to live in a ''dangerous environment'' by taking
them to her brother's residence. Police have said the residence was
used for drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Jamelle James, who shared the house with Owens' brother, Sir
Marcus Winfrey, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in
Kayla's death. James is accused of leaving a .32-caliber
semiautomatic pistol where the boy could find it. Winfrey and
another man are charged with federal weapons violations.

<HEADLINE> Schlessinger TV Show Draws Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gay rights protesters shouting ''shame,
shame, shame'' gathered outside Paramount Pictures Tuesday to
demand the studio drop plans to bring controversial radio host
Laura Schlessinger to television this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-talking host known as ''Dr. Laura,'' who dispenses
relationship advice on her enormously popular radio show, has
called homosexuality a ''biological error'' and ''deviant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When Paramount bought Laura Schlessinger's show, they bought a
battle with the gay community,'' said Joan Garry, executive
director of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signs carried by the more than 200 demonstrators read
''No More Matthew Shepards,'' a reference to the gay student killed
in Wyoming in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, which has been slammed by other gay rights groups,
has stood firm, and none of the stations signed on to air
Schlessinger's show have backed out.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the studio said it was committed to presenting
moral and ethical issues without ''creating or contributing to an
environment of hurt, hate or intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering the demonstrators were about 75 Schlessinger
supporters organized by Campaign for California Families, a
conservative, nonprofit organization.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Respond to Tobacco Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Reaction by presidential candidates George W. Bush
and Al Gore
to Tuesday's Supreme Court decision that the federal government
lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug.
Texas Gov. George W. Bush:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush believes decisions about tobacco regulation
should be made by Congress and state legislatures. He believes that
Congress should pass tough laws to keep tobacco out of the hands of
kids similar to strict anti-teen smoking laws he advocated and
signed in Texas. The Texas laws are recognized as some of the
nation's toughest.''
Vice President Al Gore:
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco is one of the most addictive substances known to man
and should be regulated as a drug. Today's new decision by the
Supreme Court puts this issue back in Congress' court. It is time
for the Republican Congress and George Bush to show their
independence from Big Tobacco and do the right thing by passing
legislation that has had bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court confirms that tobacco use among young people
poses perhaps the most significant threat to public health in the
United States. Tobacco hooks and eventually kills hundreds of
thousands of people, and we shouldn't wait another day until we
strengthen protections against it.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officals To Visit Libya  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Signaling a possibility of closer ties with
Libya, the Clinton administration is sending a four-member team to
Tripoli to assess whether conditions are safe enough to permit
renewed travel by Americans to the oil-rich country.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin said Tuesday that after the visit, a
determination will be made on whether to remove restrictions on
''travel to, in or through Libya.''
</P>
<P>
   During their 26-hour stay, beginning Wednesday, the State
Department team will assess security at airports, hotels and
hospitals and also will confer with foreign diplomats resident in
Tripoli. No meeting is planned with the Libyan leader, Moammar
Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official who briefed reporters said the visit is
unrelated to the coming trial of two Libyan suspects wanted in the
December 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, of Pan Am flight
103. Starting May 5, the two will be tried by a Scottish court
sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The official, asking not to be identified, said the decision to
send the assessment team was part of the administration's
responsibilities to the American traveling public.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has banned use of American passports for
travel to Libya since 1981 on grounds that the North African
country is unsafe for Americans. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright renewed the ban last November.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said increased non-American travel to Libya since U.N.
sanctions against the country were suspended last year has raised
questions about whether previous dangers still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe an objective answer requires an on-the-ground
examination by consular officials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some families of Pan Am 103 victims were briefed on the Libya
visit by Michael Sheehan, head of the State Department
counterterrorism office, before the official announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cohen, of Cape May Court House, N.J., whose daughter was
among 189 American victims, said she is appalled by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sends a signal to Gadhafi that we've changed our policy,
and we're ready to be friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the administration has taken note of positive steps
by Libya to end involvement in terrorism. But, he said, the country
''has a very, very long way to go before it meets the standards
required to be removed from the terrorism list.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, administration officials have a somewhat more
benign view of Libya compared with when President Reagan ordered
air attacks against Libyan targets, once in 1981 and again in 1986,
and barred U.S. oil companies from doing business in Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the bombing of Pan Am 103 was Libya's
response to the U.S. bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi 2{ years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The new mood here was outlined in a speech on Libya last Nov. 30
by Ronald Neumann, a top aide in the State Department's Middle East
bureau. ''Change can now be imagined,'' he said. But, he added, an
accommodation with Libya ''is not necessarily a near-term
likelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said U.S. policy toward Libya will
be determined by whether it complies with U.N. Security Council
requirements growing out of the Pan Am 103 bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements include payment of appropriate compensation to
families of the victims, cooperation with the Pan Am 103
investigation and trial, acceptance of responsibility for the
actions of its officials and a ''renunciation and end to support of
terrorism and terrorist groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pan Am incident, all 259 persons aboard died plus 11 more
on the ground in Lockerbie.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 227.10; Nasdaq Up 101.68  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks bounded higher Tuesday after the Federal
Reserve met Wall Street's expectations of a modest increase in
interest rates, a move that convinced investors that the battle
against inflation is nearing a successful end.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.10 to close at
10,907.34.
</P>
<P>
   The technology stocks that dominate the Nasdaq composite index
benefited most from the Fed's announcement of a quarter-percentage
point increase in short-term rates. The Nasdaq rebounded from an
early loss of as much as 100 points to close up 101.68 at 4,711.68.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 37.24 to 1,493.87.
</P>
<P>
   The market gathered momentum after the Fed confirmed Wall
Street's expectation of a quarter-point rate hike. Tuesday's
increase, the Fed's latest strike against inflation, is the fifth
since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also said it still sees a risk of rising inflation for
the foreseeable future. The statement put financial markets on
notice that the Fed remains worried about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, market analysts said that with a smattering of evidence
that has shown a slight slowdown in the economy, investors are
becoming increasingly confident that the Fed's long cycle of rate
increases is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central bank's credibility is very high right now,'' said
Chris Conkey, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston. ''The news of an increase was already
factored in, and there's a strong sense that the Fed is on top of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks that are most sensitive to inflation pushed the
Dow higher. American Express rose 3~ to 145~ and J.P. Morgan rose 5
9/16 to 129.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical companies, which fare best when the economy is strong,
also rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's been a real resurgence in the more cyclical parts of
the market, and that's a strong statement in favor of what the the
Fed is doing,'' Conkey said.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric rose 9 1/16 to 150 after telling analysts it
expects to exceed first-quarter profit estimates. GE cited strong
growth in its power systems and finance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris rose ] to 20 5/16 after the Supreme Court ruled
the government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive
drug. The ruling means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cannot
regulate tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes, label them as drugs
or dictate how they should be marketed unless Congress passes
specific legislation to allow it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Corp. rose 2 to 47[ and R.J. Reynolds rose 9/16 to 17
1/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which has slumped in recent sessions as investors
took profits from its sprint to new levels earlier this month,
turned higher on the strength of its largest companies. Cisco
Systems rose 6 47/64 to 140 55/64 and Yahoo! rose 19 47/64 to 191}.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Nasdaq stocks posted sharp losses that prevented
the index from bouncing back even more convincingly. Protein Design
Labs plunged 37 13/16 to 96 5/16 after the European Patent Office
revoked the claims of its European humanization patent.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, which lost more than half its market value Monday
after revising downward its financial results for 1998 and 1999,
continued its slide Tuesday, losing 14 7/16 to 73 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is continuing to rotate into stocks of higher
capitalization,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist
at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. ''This trend is being used as a defensive
tactic'' in light of investors' growing nervousness over smaller,
unproven technology companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.28
billion shares, compared with 1.13 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.59 to 552.79.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
slipped 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> FDA Can't Regulate Tobacco As Drug  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government lacks authority to regulate
tobacco as an addictive drug even though tobacco use may be ''the
single most significant threat to public health,'' the Supreme
Court said Tuesday, throwing out the Clinton administration's main
anti-smoking initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling, a victory for an industry under pressure from
numerous lawsuits, said Congress did not authorize the Food and
Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. President Clinton and
others immediately said Congress should pass a law letting the FDA
reinstate its rules cracking down on cigarette sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are to protect our children from the harms of tobacco,
Congress must now enact the provisions of the FDA rule,'' Clinton
said in a statement issued while he was traveling in India.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Smith, spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
welcomed the ruling. ''Business and industry throughout the nation
ought to breathe a sigh of relief. The highest court in the land
has confirmed that a federal agency cannot on its own go beyond its
limits of authority set by Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said, ''By
no means do we question the seriousness of the problem that the FDA
has sought to address.'' She said, ''The agency has amply
demonstrated that tobacco use, particularly among children and
adolescents, poses perhaps the single most significant threat to
public health in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ''We believe that Congress has clearly
precluded the FDA from asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco
products.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has been under increasing pressure for
selling a product the American Cancer Society calls the leading
cause of cancer. Cancer society head John R. Seffrin said he was
disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also has a lawsuit pending against the
industry, which has agreed to pay the states $246 billion for the
cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. Cigarette billboards
around the country were taken down last year as part of that
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, John Paul Stevens,
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Writing for the four,
Breyer said the 1938 federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act's ''basic
purpose -- the protection of public health -- supports the inclusion
of cigarettes within its scope.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling throws out the FDA's rule requiring convenience
stores and other places that sell cigarettes to require
identification from anyone under age 27 seeking to buy tobacco
products.
</P>
<P>
   Other FDA rules put on hold earlier would have limited
vending-machine cigarette sales to adults-only locations, such as
bars, and would have limited cigarette advertising. All 50 states
already ban tobacco sales to anyone under 18, and the FDA adopted
that rule nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, ''I ask the convenience stores, I
ask our drug stores, I ask our gas stations, other places where
kids can buy cigarettes to not pull back. ... I urge this community
to keep the cigarettes behind the counter, to keep that ID check
sign up'' while lawmakers push for federal legislation allowing FDA
regulation of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and several Democratic members of
Congress also called for such legislation. Attorney General Janet
Reno said, ''Nobody can reasonably question the fact that tobacco
is harmful to children and nobody should reasonably question these
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said some people
will want to give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco but ''I'm
not one of those. ... I don't think they do a very good job with
what they're doing.'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas,
added, ''I'm not anxious to extend the power and authority to the
FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stocks gained ground after the ruling. Philip Morris
rose 31\ cents to $20.25 on the New York Stock Exchange; Loews
Corp., parent of Lorillard Tobacco Co., rose $2 to $47.12{ and R.J.
Reynolds rose 56\ cents to $17.06\. But the U.S. shares of British
American Tobacco, which owns Brown &AMP; Williamson, were down 62{
cents at $9.62{.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris Co., said
last October that it acknowledged smoking is addictive and causes
cancer. Company executive Mark Berlind on Tuesday repeated the
company's position that it was willing to discuss some government
regulation, perhaps regarding ingredient labeling or efforts to
combat youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called the 1996 initiative the
FDA's most important public health and safety effort in the past 50
years. The best way to cut down on smoking is to reduce the number
of teen-agers who start, officials contend.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said for decades that it lacked authority to regulate
tobacco so long as cigarette makers did not claim that smoking
provided health benefits. But it reversed itself in 1996, citing
new evidence that the industry intended its products to feed
consumers' nicotine habits.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies sued, and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled in 1998 that Congress did not authorize the FDA to
regulate tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Daughter Makes Alzheimer Plea  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maureen Reagan said Tuesday that although her
father remains ''a handsome devil'' with a sweet tooth the ravages
of Alzheimer's disease have destroyed the former president's
ability to conduct sensible conversation.
</P>
<P>
   She urged a Senate panel to boost federal spending on
Alzheimer's research by $100 million and said that if her father
were able he would be testifying in her place on behalf of the
millions of Americans expected to suffer from the disease as the
population ages.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's doing very well but he continues to get worse so there is
a great deal of concern,'' she said. ''There is a glimmer of hope
that he has been spared some of the worst aspects of the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she still considers her father a ''handsome devil'' and
that he seemed pleased when she brought him a cake, decorated with
lots of green icing, on St. Patrick's Day. ''He has always had a
sweet tooth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alzheimer's disease doesn't make special arrangements for
presidents or first ladies, or anyone else for that matter,''
Maureen Reagan told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
health.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it takes hold it follows its own course of destruction,
frequently ravaging not only its direct victim, but also the
caregivers and loved ones along with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She called Nancy Reagan, her stepmother, ''a model for
caregivers around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not describe her father's condition in detail. She had
said in January that the former president can no longer join her in
working simple jigsaw puzzles because of failing motor skills.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, she agreed with Nancy
Reagan's statement some months ago that Reagan can no longer
conduct conversations that make sense. She referred to her father's
condition by the medical name ''aphasia,'' a disorder affecting
speech and understanding and the ability to combine thoughts and
words.
</P>
<P>
   The former president, who lives in Los Angeles, told the world
in a candid and poignant letter six years ago that he had
memory-destroying Alzheimer's disease. He hasn't been seen in
public for about a year although a photograph was released on his
89th birthday on Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, and in speaking to television cameras later,
Maureen Reagan noted that as president her father issued a
proclamation on Sept. 30, 1983, drawing national attention to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter is a board member of the Alzheimer's Association,
which released an analysis of census data estimating that the
number of Americans with Alzheimer's will increase from 4 million
to more than 14 million by mid century.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and the
senior Democrat, Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said that the former
president's condition has done more than anything else to increase
public awareness of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of who he is and the leadership he gave to this
country, it really does bring home that no one is immune ... and
that we really have to focus on this,'' Harkin said. The two
senators are seeking a $100 million increase in money for
Alzheimer's research to a total $566 million. President Clinton's
budget proposed $491 million for such research.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he was optimistic about the increase.

<HEADLINE> France Won't Raise Retirement Age  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France will not raise its retirement age to stave
off an expected deficit in its pension system, Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said in a key policy statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin shied away from announcing any major reforms to the
retirement system, saying his leftist coalition government was
committed to the pay-as-you-go method of funding old-age pensions
with contributions from wage earners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the difficulties expected for the pension system,
although real, are not sufficient to jeopardize the pay-as-you-go
system,'' he said. ''The government is making a commitment. Today's
pensions will be fully guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   While France's retirement system is expected to post a deficit
after 2010, when millions of baby boomers will be in retirement,
Jospin said the robust economy and falling unemployment rate would
boost state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   He ruled out increasing the country's retirement age or
taxpayers' contributions as a way of funding the shortfall. The
general age for retirement in France is 65, although some public
service workers can retire before that age.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said a new special reserve fund would be set up
using surpluses from France's social security system, the nation's
overall welfare program. The fund is expected to total $148 billion
by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin said French workers who wanted to could put aside money
for retirement. But he added, that private-funded pensions must
only be regarded as a ''complement'' to the state-run system.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin left the door open to a possible selloff of government
assets -- including part of its 63 percent stake in France Telecom
SA to help meet pension obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Jospin sought to defend his government's record in a
lively session in the National Assembly. ''We had a policy of
reform and we will continue to reform,'' he said as opposition
lawmakers jeered.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of discontent with the government, Finance
Minister Christian Sautter was forced Monday to withdraw plans to
streamline the nation's unwieldy tax collection system.
</P>
<P>
   Sautter's failure to push through the reforms was seized on by
critics who said government efforts to implement much-needed
economic and social reforms have stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   ''This reform was badly prepared, badly organized. The
government is unable to manage its own house, just as it is unable
to manage France,'' said former Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre,
of the conservative Rally for the Republic party.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's speech was partly eclipsed Tuesday by thousands of
teachers who marched through Paris, calling for more money and
jobs. A national strike has been called for Friday, with teachers
from around the country set to come to Paris for a protest march.

<HEADLINE> Israel Official: Water Key to Peace  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Stressing the leading role water
plays in the conflict in the Middle East, Israel's Regional Affairs
Minister Shimon Peres on Tuesday called the precious resource ''the
key to lasting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel prize winner made the comments during an international
conference on water in The Hague where business leaders, volunteer
organizations and politicians gathered to discuss global water
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make water the beginning of a real peace,'' Peres
said. ''We would be ready to negotiate water before peace.'' The
former prime minister added that any peace settlement or agreement
on water rights in the long term would have to include Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Hague water conference coincides with peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians in Washington, which resumed Tuesday
after a five-week interruption. Water rights are one of the
contentious issues due to be resolved in a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to the states to work together to resolve their
differences, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev offered to
mediate on water issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev, head of Swiss-based Green Cross International, a
volunteer organization that promotes water and nature conservation,
met with leading water affairs officials from Jordan, Israel and
the Palestinian territories while at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''He plans to take on a mediation role, first with the three
parties and then hopefully with Syria,'' said Alexander Likhotal,
the vice president of Green Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian delegate from the An-Najah University echoed
Gorbachev's views.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Palestinians don't even have the most basic access to
water,'' said Anan Al Jayyousi, director of the university's water
and environment studies department. ''If we don't have it, we won't
have peace.''

<HEADLINE> Hotel Chain Settles Bias Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Adam's Mark luxury hotel chain agreed
Tuesday to pay $8 million, revise policies and seek minority
customers, in settlement of racial discrimination lawsuits by the
Justice Department, Florida and a group of black guests at a
college reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement includes $1.5 million for Florida to distribute
to four historically black schools -- Florida A&AMP;M University,
Bethune-Cookman College, Edward Waters College and Florida Memorial
College -- for scholarships and internships in hotel management.
</P>
<P>
   As well, $4.4 million is to be divided among the more than 1,200
people who went to the reunion last spring at the Adam's Mark in
Daytona Beach, Fla. The chain will also bring in a national equal
employment opportunity group to train its employees in
nondiscrimination and monitor their compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will ''ensure that every guest is treated equally
and fairly,'' Attorney General Janet Reno told a news conference.
Joining her, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said,
''Adam's Mark chose to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest and most comprehensive settlement ever of a
racial bias case involving hotels, attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Justice Department alleged the chain of 21
large, full-service hotels in 13 states charged black customers
higher prices than whites and segregated them in less desirable
rooms as part of a corporate pattern of discrimination. Florida
alleged violations of state consumer protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last year, five black vacationers brought a class action
suit against the chain over the treatment of black guests at the
Black College Reunion weekend in April. They alleged the Daytona
Beach Adam's Mark singled them out as security risks and made them,
but not white guests, wear bright orange wristbands to get into the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Black reunion guests were charged more than other special event
guests and had to pay cash in full upon reserving rooms,
Butterworth said in December. Reunion guests were not allowed to
use telephones, minibars or movies in their rooms without first
paying a large cash deposit, and were required to pay cash for room
service and at hotel restaurants and bars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.4 million will be shared by 1,200 black guests at the
reunion and an undetermined number of friends who visited them
there, their attorney, John Relman, said. The five original
plaintiffs will get $25,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, which helped bring the private
lawsuit and has urged people to boycott the chain since June 1998,
said in Baltimore that ''with this agreement, the call for economic
sanctions against the hotel chain has been suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the chain agreed to pay $112,000 to the four black
Florida colleges to coordinate and promote the annual Black College
Reunion over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Florida A&AMP;M President Frederick Humphries said this fund, along
with the scholarships and internships, would help add minority
employees to hotel staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money will pay attorney fees and administrative
costs of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kummer, president of the chain, said Adam's Mark ''has
never intentionally done anything wrong.'' But he added that ''we
apologize for any actions that may have made any of our guests feel
uncomfortable or unwelcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are willing to take these extra steps to demonstrate ...
that we are absolutely committed to diversity and equality,'' he
said from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's Mark agreed to hire Project Equality of Kansas City, Mo.,
to investigate complaints by guests, to design nondiscrimination
training for all hotel employees, to test the hotels' compliance
annually and to come up with a marketing plan to attract black
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Acting U.S. Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee said other
hotels are under investigation for racial bias. Calling the Adam's
Mark agreement ''a model for the future,'' Reno urged ''all members
of the hospitality industry to review their own operations to
ensure that no discriminatory practices exist.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Ponders Damages in Tobacco Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Jurors who found that a dying ex-smoker was
deceived by the nation's two largest tobacco companies began
hearing evidence Tuesday on whether to add punitive damages to the
$1.7 million they awarded to the woman and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-tobacco advocate said the Superior Court verdict shows
the industry's long-successful defense posture is crumbling before
juries, even as the companies thrive in other forums. The Supreme
Court ruled Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration has no
authority to regulate tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The familiar victim-blaming defense ... only works until the
jury gets to hear the choices tobacco executives have made'' in
manufacturing and marketing their products, said Richard Daynard, a
law professor at Northeastern University and chairman of the
Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages suits against
cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the jury to award substantial punitive
damages against Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds. Testimony on the
companies' financial worth and conduct was scheduled to last the
rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 12-member San Francisco jury ordered the Philip
Morris Cos. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. to pay $1.7
million in compensatory damages to Leslie Whiteley, 40, a former
smoker dying of lung cancer, and to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds said the verdict was the first to assess damages
against the company for smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It is also believed to be the first verdict in the nation in
favor of a smoker who started after 1965, when the federal
government first required surgeon general's warnings on cigarette
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Whitely, 40, of Ojai in Ventura County, said she started
smoking in 1972, at age 13. She smoked Philip Morris' Marlboros and
Reynolds' Camels until 1998, when she quit shortly before doctors
diagnosed small-cell lung cancer. Doctors say she is likely to die
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies said Whitely harmed herself by her
admitted use of marijuana, by smoking during pregnancy and by
disregarding warnings on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she liked smoking and didn't want to quit,'' Philip
Morris attorney Chris Hardy told jurors during closing arguments.
Reynolds lawyer Jeffrey Furr said the companies have tried to make
their products safer but everyone knows cigarettes have some
inherent risk.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing internal industry documents, jurors found
that the companies designed cigarettes negligently, then made false
or misleading statements to the public and concealed information
about the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded $1.47 million to Whitely and $250,000 to her
husband, Leonard, for loss of marital companionship.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is the second against tobacco companies since
California changed its law in 1997 to allow suits by individual
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Another San Francisco jury awarded $51 million in February 1999
to Patricia Henley, a longtime three-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who
sued Philip Morris after being diagnosed with lung cancer. The
verdict was cut to $26.5 million by the trial judge and is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Miami is considering potentially huge punitive damages
against five tobacco companies and two trade organizations in a
suit on behalf of 500,000 smokers that reportedly could reach as
high as $300 billion.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: Subsidies Threaten Boeing  </HEADLINE>
By PEGGY ANDERSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Pat Buchanan warned Tuesday that subsidies to
Airbus Industrie, a European aerospace consortium, are a threat to
Boeing, the world's No. 1 maker of passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan described Airbus as a ''subsidized socialist cartel
which is designed by our European allies to basically take down the
American aerospace and aircraft industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping over en route to a Reform Party convention in Alaska,
Buchanan said Airbus already has driven Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas from the market and ''now has Boeing under attack.'' He
said the effort is succeeding because ''we Americans and our
government ... are asleep at the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is campaigning for the Reform presidential
nomination, said an administration with him in charge of the White
House would reciprocate in kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they've got enough money to hand out to kill Boeing ...
maybe it's time Europeans defended themselves ... and stopped
freeloading off the American defense budget,'' he said in reference
to his opposition to U.S. military involvement in Kosovo, Bosnia
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the United States ought to tell Japan and China,
both of which have trade surpluses at U.S. expense, ''either you
buy Boeings or your sales don't get into the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A protectionist, Buchanan said the United States should use its
leverage to ''defend our basic industries from what is an unfair,
illegitimate attack by ungrateful allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who trails Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al
Gore in public opinion polls on the presidential campaign, said he
believes he has an ''outside chance of winning the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is extraordinary volatility in the American
electorate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Agency: Canada Lynx Is Threatened  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has listed the
nocturnal, tuft-eared Canada lynx -- a symbol of opposition to
development in the Rockies -- as a threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists had hoped the lynx would be declared
endangered, which would have offered even greater protections. But
Mike Senatore of Defenders of Wildlife said: ''It's clearly a step
forward in lynx conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, environmentalists have been pressing the agency to
protect the snowshoe-pawed cat, which is so secretive that
biologists had a tough time studying it. Tuesday's decision applies
only to the Lower 48 since the lynx thrives in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Now all forest management plans and permits must be reviewed,
said Diane Gansauer of the Colorado Wildlife Federation. That
includes logging, recreation and mining. In some cases, private
landowners, ranchers and outfitters could face restrictions. But
she expected the impact to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the Endangered Species Act is to recover species
to levels where protection under the act is no longer necessary.
These forest management plans will serve as blueprints for
recovery,'' said Ralph Morgenweck, a Fish and Wildlife Service's
regional director.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists contended ski expansions were destroying the
animal's habitat. After lawsuits aimed at stopping an expansion at
Vail failed, eco-terrorists claimed responsibility for setting
fires that caused $12 million in damage on Vail Mountain in 1998.
No one has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve conservation groups filed a lawsuit March 13 in U.S.
District Court in Washington, accusing the Fish and Wildlife
Service of repeatedly missing court-ordered deadlines on a lynx
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Colorado declared the lynx endangered in 1973, and
began restoring the animals to mountain areas last year. It has
imported nearly 100 animals from Canada and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the state will release 50 cats, which will wear
satellite collars to allow precise tracking. The cats also have
been fattened up to avoid starvation. Four of the first five lynx
released last spring starved to death before they could find the
snowshoe hares that are their prey.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: FAA approves Stewart privatization  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Federal officials have approved the
privatization of Stewart International Airport, Gov. George Pataki
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration approval was the final
regulatory hurdle needed to complete the deal for the Newburgh
airport. Stewart is now the first airport in the nation to
privatize under the new FAA pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   ''This month we will show the rest of the country that the
entrepreneurial hands of the private sector will take advantage of
Stewart Airport to strengthen the local economy, improve air travel
services and bring additional economic development and job creation
to the region,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, National Express Group, a subsidiary of a
British transportation company, will lease the airport from the
state for 99 years. It will be able to run the airport 60 miles
north of New York City as it wishes within regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was negotiated by the Pataki administration and
recently received an okay from state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   New York state will get $35 million plus 5 percent of the gross
after 10 years or 1.38 million passengers, whichever comes first.

<HEADLINE> 30-Year Bond Prices Spurt Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of 30-year bonds spurted higher as the
yield fell below 6 percent for the first time in six months
Tuesday, helped by a Federal Reserve rate hike aimed at curbing
inflation pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/16, or
$4.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell to 5.97 percent from 6 percent on Tuesday.
It was long bond's first close below 6 percent since Sept. 24,
1999, when the yield was 5.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, in a widely expected move, raised
short-term interest rates for the fifth time since June in an
effort to cool down the red-hot economy before it triggers
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank said it was boosting its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge on overnight loans, from
5.75 percent, where it was raised Feb. 2, to 6 percent. The Fed
also increased its largely symbolic discount rate, the interest it
charges to make loans directly to banks, by a quarter point to 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent long-term bonds higher, since inflation tends to
erode the value of securities held for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities
ranged from 1/32 point to 3/32 point higher, and intermediate
maturities rose by up to ] point, reported Bridge Telerate, a
financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.92 percent as the
discount fell 0.03 percentage point to 5.75 percent. Six-month
yields were 6.13 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage
point to 5.86 percent. One-year yields were 6.21 percent as the
discount held at 5.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 5.75 percent from 5.68} percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 5/32 point to 94 15/32. The average
yield to maturity fell to 6.04 percent from 6.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Cops provoked Dorismond shooting  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A co-worker of Patrick Dorismond renewed his
allegations Tuesday that undercover narcotics officers started the
fight that resulted in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man
outside a midtown Manhattan bar.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kaiser, who claims to be the only civilian eyewitness to
the controversial shooting, told reporters the tragedy unfolded
after ''three men who appeared like derelicts approached us for
weed.''
</P>
<P>
   The two off-duty security guards told the men to go away, Kaiser
said. But one -- an officer he identified as Anderson Moran --
taunted them with snarling sounds before the shooter, Detective
Anthony Vasquez, assaulted Dorismond, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Detective Vasquez throw the first punch at my friend,
Patrick Dorismond,'' said Kaiser, reading from a statement at a
Brooklyn news conference with the Rev. Al Sharpton and announcing a
wrongful arrest claim against the city. ''Patrick did nothing to
cause the officer to strike him. At or about the same time, I heard
the gun go off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 22, of Queens, said the officers, all dressed in street
clothes, never identified themselves as police. After Dorismond was
shot, he added, he heard one of the officers say, ''Cuff that shot
mother-(expletive).'' Kaiser is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting last week of Dorismond, 26, a Brooklyn native of
Haitian descent -- coupled with city officials' decision to defend
the shooting by making public his record of petty crime -- has
outraged black activists, the victim's family and members of the
city's Haitian community. It also has fueled political sniping
between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton in their
race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Monday night in Harlem, Clinton said Giuliani has
''led the rush to judgment. That is not real leadership.'' Other
Democrats have charged that City Hall broke state law by releasing
information from a sealed juvenile case against the victim.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, under fire for not speaking
out sooner, wrote the mayor a letter saying he was ''deeply
troubled by your release of sealed records that are irrelevant to
the tragic death of Patrick Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor accused Clinton of trying to ''use (the shooting) as a
campaign issue. ... What she did last night was entirely
political.'' He also fed reporters new details about Dorismond's
brushes with the law, including a March 7 incident in which he
allegedly punched his girlfriend on the side of the head while she
was holding the couple's 1-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am giving you facts that you resist printing,'' Giuliani
said. ''That Mr. Dorismond spent a good deal of his adult life
punching people is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's account of the botched narcotics sting operation
contradicted those of police officials and an attorney for Vasquez,
and deviated from his own statements in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The witness reportedly had claimed earlier that Moran -- not
Vasquez -- threw the initial punch, before Dorismond swung back.
Meanwhile, Vasquez has maintained that Moran was being attacked by
Dorismond when he and another back-up officer came to his aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We categorically deny that any one of those police officers
initiated a physical confrontation,'' the attorney, Philip Karasyk,
said Tuesday. ''The first punch was thrown by Mr. Dorismond.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez has claimed through Karasyk that as he rushed in he
heard one of the two men tangling with Moran say, ''Get the gun.''
He responded by yelling, ''Police! Police!'' and drawing his own
weapon. Dorismond was grabbing at the gun before it went off,
sending a bullet into his chest, the officer claims.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser's attorney, Sanford Rubenstein, refused to let his client
comment beyond his statement. The legal claim -- alleging that
police beat Kaiser and falsely imprisoned him after the shooting --
seeks $15 million in damages from the city.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times after the Thursday
shooting, Kaiser described a confrontation in which Dorsimond and
one of the officers ''get real loud with each other, and one of the
officers swings at him first. ... Patrick proceeded to swing back,
and that's when the shot let out.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir has also been criticized for
his handling of the shooting. It was Safir who read Dorismond's
criminal record to reporters just hours after the shooting. On
Wednesday, The Village Voice plans to run a page one editorial
calling for Safir's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, said the Voice had ''fallen
prey to this whole political atmosphere.''

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Reviving Pepsi Challenge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pepsi-Cola Co. hopes to reignite the cola wars
against rival Coca-Cola Co. by bringing back its Pepsi Challenge
promotional campaign for the first time in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second biggest soft drink company kicks off the new
campaign during the Academy Awards telecast on ABC this Sunday with
a commercial featuring baseball superstar Ken Griffey Jr. hitting
baseballs that invite consumers to compare the taste of Pepsi with
its bigger rival, Coca-Coca Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola plans to conduct demonstrations at ballparks, concert
arenas and other venues across the country in which consumers can
conduct blind taste tests of Pepsi and Coke and decide which tastes
better.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes as both leading cola brands lost market share
in 1999 to non-colas such as Mountain Dew, Sprite and Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Classic was the top-selling brand of carbonated soft
drinks in the U.S. last year with 20.3 percent of the market, down
from 20.6 percent in 1998, while Pepsi-Cola was second at 13.8
percent, down 0.4 percentage point from a year earlier, according
to the Beverage Digest/Maxwell report.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi Challenge first appeared in 1975 as a local promotion
in Dallas and gradually expanded nationally before halting in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But Pepsi executives say the promotions were one factor behind
Coca-Cola's ill-fated introduction of New Coke to replace
traditional Coke in 1985. A consumer outcry drove Coca-Cola to
bring back the original flavor as Coca-Cola Classic within a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   One new ripple this time -- consumers will also get a chance to
compare Pepsi One, a one-calorie cola, with Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ''In either case, we have a leg up,'' said Dawn Hudson, the top
marketing executive for Pepsi-Cola North America which is based in
Purchase, N.Y. ''But people need to figure it out for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Coca-Cola spokeswoman Polly Howes said the Pepsi
Challenge was ''just another sip test, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is anything we have learned over the years it is that
people like their Coca-Cola Classic just the way it is. The love
affair with Coke is still as strong as ever,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> BASF To Buy Herbicide Division  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. has sold its
agricultural chemicals division for a higher-than-expected price of
$3.8 billion to German chemical giant BASF, saying it wants to
focus on its more profitable drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of American Home rose $3.06\ to $55.50 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange after the sale of Cyanamid was announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the division that makes herbicides, fungicides and
pesticides would double BASF's agricultural chemicals business,
expand its North and South American businesses and allow the
company to save $250 million a year by eliminating overlapping
operations, BASF said.
</P>
<P>
   Madison-based American Home, maker of drugs and health care
products like Advil and Chapstick, was able to refocus itself and
jettison a division that had been performing poorly in recent
years, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes the company easier to understand,'' said Mike
Krensavage, an analyst for Brown Bros. Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said American Home fetched a much higher price for
the division than expected, raising speculation there had been a
bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I actually thought they'd be lucky to get $2.5 billion for
it,'' said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Chase, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   American Home may be positioning itself as a better candidate
for a merger in the drug industry after three failed merger
attempts, Krensavage said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows American Home's failed attempt six months ago
to merge with Warner-Lambert Co., which is being acquired by Pfizer
Inc. The company in 1998 unsuccessfully attempted a merger with
Monsanto Co., and also held negotiations with SmithKline Beecham
PLC that fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Zisson said the sale of Cyanamid is unlikely to affect American
Home's chances for a larger deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it a little cleaner, but this wasn't a division that
wasn't preventing a transaction from happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   American Home also faces problems attracting a merger partner
because of legal liabilities surrounding fen-phen, the diet drug
combination that has been linked to heart problems. American Home
made fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the combination, and is hoping
people who took the drug sign onto a nationwide settlement that
would put a limit on its liabilities. However, some users have
decided to opt out of the deal, leaving uncertainty on how much
American Home will have to pay to settle fen-phen claims.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale of Cyanamid to BASF is is cleared by regulatory
authorities, it would take effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The German company would assume debt from AHP's Cyanamid unit
related to operations in Asia. BASF wouldn't say how much debt it
would take, but The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified
sources in Tuesday's editions, put the figure at $100 million.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Detain 150 Kurds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Police detained more than 150 Kurds on
Tuesday after authorities banned public celebrations of the Kurdish
New Year in Istanbul and several other cities.
</P>
<P>
   In the southeastern city of Sanliurfa, 10 people were detained
for jumping over burning tires. It is a tradition on Nowruz, the
Kurdish New Year, to jump over fire and symbolically burn away
impurities and memories.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained 92 people in the Istanbul neighborhood of
Bakirkoy, where Kurds were said to be planning celebrations of
Nowruz, the Anatolia news agency reported. At least 55 others were
rounded up in other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they detained men who were walking in the area and
who they suspected were planning to take part in illegal
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's pro-Kurdish Democracy People's Party, or HADEP, said
police had detained people in about half a dozen other cities
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   HADEP officials urged Kurds not to violate the government ban in
Istanbul, and said they had applied for permission to celebrate
Nowruz on Sunday. Istanbul is home to an estimated one million
Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds celebrate their New Year with the arrival of spring on
Tuesday, while Iranians, along with people in many Central Asian
republics, began celebrations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Past festivities -- an occasion for Kurds to assert their
cultural identity in Turkey -- have ended in riots that claimed
dozens of lives. Turkey does not recognize its 12 million Kurds as
a minority, and views Kurdish cultural identity as a threat to the
Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
   This year's festivities come after Kurdish rebels announced an
end to their 15-year armed struggle for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, in a Nowruz message from
his Turkish prison island, urged Turkey to take steps ''in the
spirit of brotherhood'' to secure a peace.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 Kurds gathered under heavy security outside
Diyarbakir, the largest southeastern city, to mark Nowruz with
fires, dances and music in celebrations that the government
authorized HADEP to organize.

<HEADLINE> Rap Brown Took Shelter Ala. County  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ZENOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE HALL, Ala. (AP) -- The arrest of former black militant H.
Rap Brown in rural Alabama stirred up memories of a time when tiny
Lowndes County claimed a prominent role in the civil rights
movement and the clamor for black power.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Muslim who now goes by the name Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin,
was wanted in the shooting of a sheriff's deputy in Atlanta when he
was captured Monday night in the same backwoods region where he
helped lead a voting rights push in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   His return as a fugitive raised a question of whether he is the
black power rebel of old or a wrongly accused Islam convert who
began as a peaceful voting rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a religious leader now,'' said Sharif Al-Malik, a Muslim
who recently moved to White Hall from nearby Selma. ''Instead of
saying, 'Burn, baby, burn,' he says if you don't do right hell will
burn you.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin tried to form a mosque in White Hall about a year ago,
Mayor John Jackson said. Several Muslim families live in the town,
and friends of Al-Amin ran a restaurant called Bismallah Cafe, or
''In the Name of God,'' where no pork or alcohol was served.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is now closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't even allow people in the restaurant who were
drinking and smoking,'' Jackson said. ''Young people couldn't
believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were really good for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's legacy in Lowndes County is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the voting rights protest led Al-Amin and others
to form the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, which took the
black panther as its emblem -- in sharp contrast to the dominant
local Democratic Party's white rooster.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all were interested in grass-roots organizing,'' said
Clayborne Carson, a Stanford historian and director of the
university's Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project. ''Particularly
in developing independent, black-controlled political
organizations. That became the Lowndes County Freedom Organization,
and then they took the symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew the panther was a noble animal and didn't bother
anybody, and we didn't bother anybody,'' said John Hulett, a black
man who went door to door fighting to bring blacks to the polls and
who eventually became Lowndes County's sheriff. ''But when you put
a panther in a corner, he's not going to run away, and that's why
we chose them.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Al-Amin and fellow civil rights activist Stokeley
Carmichael left the Lowndes County area, they formed a militant
group dubbed the Black Panthers, which veered some of the civil
rights crusade down a violent path.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, who as known as H. Rap Brown, called violence ''as
American as cherry pie,'' eventually served five years in prison
for a robbery and shooting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''They went to California and saw the symbol of a black panther
and everybody started calling them the Black Panthers,'' said
Hulett, now Lowndes County's probate judge.
</P>
<P>
   Lowndes County is ''a very important place in black history,''
said Raymond Wolters, a University of Delaware history professor
who specializes in race relations. ''Not only because of the Black
Panther Party voting drives there in the '60s, but long before
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the county's significance lies in its location --
squarely between Selma, in Dallas County, and the capital,
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the center of the voting rights agitation,'' Wolters
said. ''There was a lot of groundwork before the voting rights
movement took hold, and that groundwork really began in Lowndes
County,'' Wolters said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the first group of black candidates won their elections,
but it set the stage for what was to come in the predominantly
black county.
</P>
<P>
   ''We accomplished something by getting them on the ballot,''
said Hulett, sheriff from 1970 to 1992. ''We had a lot of people
who couldn't read or write, but they could go out and pull the
lever.''

<HEADLINE> Video Games, Violence Said Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mother of a Paducah, Ky., school shooting
victim urged lawmakers Tuesday to crack down on the video game
industry, contending her daughter's teen-age killer learned to
shoot accurately from playing ultraviolent games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am here today to ask you not to be an obstruction that makes
it harder for parents to protect their children,'' Sabrina Steger
said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the impact on
children of video game violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a nurse, I'm in the business of recognizing signs of
illness, and I see Americans addicted to violence and in denial of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steger asked lawmakers to ban sales to minors of mature-rated
video games and to finance a public awareness campaign aimed at
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Kayce and two others died in 1997 and five students
were wounded when 14-year-old Michael Carneal opened fire on
students who had been praying. Carneal pleaded guilty but mentally
ill and was sentenced to life in prison last Dec. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at a congressional hearing testified last year that
Carneal rarely fired a rifle and never shot a pistol but had plenty
of practice with arcade-quality point-and-shoot games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Steger and the parents of the two other slain children are suing
entertainment companies, saying the creators of popular films,
violent video games and sex-oriented World Wide Web sites
influenced Carneal.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Anderson, a psychology professor at Iowa State University,
said research shows video games can trigger aggressive and violent
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is good reason to think the effects of exposure to
violent video games will be even greater'' than to television and
movies, he told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing room audience watched a video game and heard
descriptions from committee Chairman Sam Brownback, R-Kan., of
several others. In one popular game, ''Duke Nukem,'' nude female
prostitutes, some bound to posts, beg to be killed, Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback contends video companies deliberately market
mature-rated games to children. He said he was frustrated that nine
industry executives rejected invitations for their companies to be
represented at the hearing. He included their names, company
addresses and phone numbers with copies of his opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows contempt for Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, president of the National Institute on Media and
the Family, said his group has forwarded to the Federal
Communications Commission documents that he said show video
companies target children.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, under orders from President
Clinton, is investigating Hollywood's marketing practices for
violent shows and games.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Air Anti-Gore Ad  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmental groups are spending $60,000 on
ads skewering Vice President Al Gore over negotiations on a global
treaty to ban harmful chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects and
other genetic abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they prefer Gore to Republican George W. Bush in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from more than 100 countries are meeting in Bonn,
Germany, this week to hammer out details of a global treaty to ban
the world's deadliest environmental poisons. Some critics have
accused the United States of trying to weaken the treaty's
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under pressure from the chemical industry, Bill Clinton and Al
Gore are standing in the way of a strong global treaty that would
phase out these chemicals,'' says a TV ad now airing on cable news
stations in Washington. The ad contains pictures of pregnant women
and infants to emphasize the point that the chemicals make their
way into babies' systems before they are born.
</P>
<P>
   Banning these chemicals isn't simple, since they also are used
to kill mosquitoes and prevent malaria, saving millions of lives.
DDT, for instance, while banned in many nations, is still endorsed
by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The $60,000 campaign also includes print ads in The New York
Times and in USA Today's European edition, said Ken Cook, president
of the Environmental Working Group, one of a handful of groups
paying for the ads.
</P>
<P>
   He said the goal is to get the administration's attention,
particularly Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone's expecting some action from the vice president,''
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign professed no fear: ''Anyone who cares about the
environment will vote for Al Gore in the fall,'' said spokesman
Doug Hattaway.

<HEADLINE> Officials expand sprinkler project to $90 million, consider addingfraternities  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Senate lawmakers and the Whitman
administration have agreed to put another $40 million into a
project to install fire-suppression sprinklers in all university
dorms in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are also contemplating expanding the sprinkler mandate
to include off-campus fraternity and sorority houses that are
privately owned. Three students died in a fire Sunday at an
off-campus fraternity near Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania.
Two were from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee approved the changes Monday to bring the
total package to $90 million and to expand sprinkler coverage to
include residence halls at private high schools and prep schools.
The spending bill and a companion law require the work to be
completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Richman, deputy commissioner of the Department of
Community Affairs, said surveys of state and private universities
showed that the $50 million proposed when the bill was introduced
would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority last month
reported that 36,600 beds in college dorm rooms -- about 71 percent
of the total -- have no sprinklers. This included eight colleges and
universities where none of the dorms have sprinklers in students'
rooms, including Rider University, Kean University and Seton Hall
University, site of a Jan. 19 fire that claimed three lives and
left six students critically injured.
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall already has a contract in place to have sprinklers in
all dorm rooms by the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed Monday by the Senate budget committee would
update a 1991 law that required sprinklers in all new dormitory
rooms. The bill would expand that law to require sprinklers in
every room in every dorm in New Jersey, regardless of whether the
building is old, new, public or private.
</P>
<P>
   The $90 million fund would provide partial loans at discount
interest rates. Public colleges would be obligated to repay half
the debt, and the state would cover the rest, turning it into what
would in effect be a cash grant.
</P>
<P>
   For private institutions, the state would cover a third of the
debt, leaving the rest to the college to pay from its tuition or
endowment sources.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill now heads to the full Senate, but Richman said
talks are continuing to amend the bill again to cover private
fraternity and sorority houses.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternity and sorority houses that are on-campus and owned by
the university, such as those at Rider, were covered by the current
legislation since it was introduced. Richman said municipal
officials would have to step in to enforce a sprinkler law for
off-campus fraternities.

<HEADLINE> McCain Would Rather Be Back on Bus  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a presidential bid that catapulted him
to national prominence, John McCain returned to the Senate on
Tuesday with a withering attack on Vice President Al Gore and a
pledge to help Republican candidates in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd much rather be on the Straight Talk Express,'' the Arizona
senator joked, a wistful reference to his campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCain spent his day in the Senate's familiar confines.
He accepted plaudits from colleagues for his campaign. He commented
on American policy in Kosovo, opposing any lifting of sanctions
against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he favors government regulation of tobacco, but
expressed skepticism that will happen until campaign finance laws
are changed to curb the influence of big money. He pledged to
pursue his ''reform agenda'' in the final months of the
congressional session. And he arranged to speak Wednesday at the
weekly closed-door meeting of House Republicans, to underscore his
eagerness to help keep the GOP majority in Congress this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The day was salted with references to the campaign just
concluded. Welcomed with applause by fellow GOP senators, he joked
that he could give any of them a personalized tour of New
Hampshire, where he conducted more than 100 town meetings.
</P>
<P>
   As a White House contender, McCain was fond of saying he would
''beat Al Gore like a drum.'' And at midday, in front of dozens of
reporters, he offered a glimpse of what he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's recent comments emphasizing support for
changes in the campaign finance laws, McCain said the ''first, most
important step is to see that a full and complete investigation''
takes place into the Clinton-Gore 1996 fund-raising scandals. The
Democrats' search for funds, he said, amounted to ''incredible
abuses of the institutions of government and every ethical
standard'' of campaign finance, as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is serious, McCain added, ''he will demand'' that
Attorney General Janet Reno recommend appointment of an independent
counsel to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has denied any wrongdoing, and Reno has refused to appoint
an independent counsel despite recommendations from FBI Director
Louis Freeh and the head of her own task force.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also called on Gore to ''renounce any involvement'' in
soft money. Until he does both things, McCain said, Gore ''has no
credibility'' as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal, Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign spokesman, said
presumptive GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush was a
''Texas-sized obstacle to campaign finance reform ... If John
McCain had been his party's nominee there would not be soft money
in this year's presidential campaign. Thus far, George W. Bush has
ducked, he's dodged, he's bobbed and he's weaved on campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about supporting Bush, McCain offered a more tempered
response.
</P>
<P>
   He said he intends ''to support the nominee of my party,'' and
will ''demand no concessions'' from him. He also said he would not
accept the vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had requests for campaign appearances from
approximately 40 House members and would appear, in particular, for
those who ''are committed to the reform agenda. But he was somewhat
imprecise on what that meant. Support for a ban on soft money, for
example, is not a requirement for his help, he said. ''They should
be willing to negotiate and move forward on that important issue,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's reform-based campaign helped propel him to victory in
New Hampshire in February, and fuel his rise in the race in the
weeks that followed.
</P>
<P>
   He attracted independents and some Democrats to his candidacy,
and frequently criticized his own party along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday was a day for niceties. Behind the closed doors of
the weekly GOP senators' luncheon, the party chairman, Jim
Nicholson, praised McCain's ability to attract voters who don't
always side with Republicans. There were warm words, as well, from
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Sen. Don Nickles, the GOP whip,
according to aides who attended.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, voiced similar sentiments in
public. ''He has brought new people into the process,'' she said.
''He has shown what courage is, and he has given people an idea of
what courage and a background of serving one's country'' can be.
</P>
<P>
   Despite extensive media coverage, McCain sought to keep his
return as unobtrusive as possible. He did not alert colleagues, for
example, to his intention to go to the Senate floor in late
morning. As a result, McCain was the only Republican in the chamber
when he spoke, and only one Democrat, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada,
was there to listen.

<HEADLINE> No Banned Hormone Found in US Meat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal investigation has found no use of an
illegal growth hormone that the Swiss government said it discovered
in samples of American beef last summer, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss government notified the United States last July that
the banned carcinogen, diethylstilbestrol, or DES, was detected in
two samples of U.S. beef that was marketed as free of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   But a recently completed investigation by the Food and Drug
Administration and the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service found no evidence that the hormone had been used
by producers or feedlots that supplied the plant where the beef was
processed, said Catherine Woteki, USDA's undersecretary for food
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Dutch laboratory was unable to confirm results of
the Swiss testing, so it's ''possible that DES was not present'' in
the samples, Woteki said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not identify the plant, but officials with Farmland
National Beef Packing Co. have said that at least one of the
allegedly tainted samples was traced to its plant in Liberal, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The hormone was banned in 1979. The Agriculture Department
stopped testing most beef for it in 1991 after failing to find the
compound for several years.
</P>
<P>
   USDA had planned before the Swiss complaint to resume testing
for DES this year as part of a plan to make sure it isn't being
used. The testing regimen is expected to begin later this spring.

<HEADLINE> Glock Won't Sign Gun-Control Deal  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- Glock Inc. will not sign a voluntary
gun-control agreement similar to the one reached last week between
Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. and the Clinton administration, the company
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal-breaker was the creation of an outside ''oversight
commission,'' made up of local, state and federal officials, who
would supervise the gun manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commission is an absurd concept,'' said Paul Jannuzzo,
vice president and general counsel of the Smyrna-based company, a
unit of Glock GmbH of Austria. ''It's overly broad. It's more
powerful than any regulatory agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun
manufacturer, agreed to make its handguns more childproof by
installing safety locks and developing ''smart gun'' technology.
Smith &AMP; Wesson also agreed to the same oversight commission that
Glock opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson accepted the restrictions in exchange for some
protection against lawsuits. At least 15 of 29 cities and counties
that had sued the gun industry have agreed to drop Smith &AMP; Wesson
from their lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Any changes at Glock, however, will not be made with an eye
toward avoiding lawsuits, Jannuzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's going to drop any of these lawsuits unless we sign on
to the commission,'' Jannuzzo said. ''And we will never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of adopting the entire agreement, Glock will consider
''sensible and workable'' parts of the plan, Jannuzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Such elements might include keeping an electronic record of
sales and requiring employees to pass a written exam. Those steps
go beyond current federal law.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drugs Adviser Reports Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has made ''substantial
progress'' in its fight against illegal drugs in the past year, the
White House drugs policy director said. He reported declines in
youth drug use, drug-related crime and amounts of narcotics
produced in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   But in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday to a congressional
committee, Barry McCaffrey also said heroin has become more popular
among young people, and methamphetamines have a ''serious potential
nationally to become the next 'crack' cocaine epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of McCaffrey's statement on the first of what is to
become an annual report on the state of the nation's anti-drug
effort was made available Tuesday to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nation working together has made substantial progress in
confronting illegal drug abuse and drug trafficking. In the report,
we show that youth drug use dropped 13 percent last year, overall
cocaine use is down, methamphetamine seizures are dramatically up
and drug crime and drug-related murders are dropping,'' McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said efforts to curb production abroad are working. Peru
and Bolivia, formerly the top two suppliers of U.S. cocaine, ''have
reduced coca cultivation by 66 percent and 55 percent
respectively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more must be done to combat heroin and methamphetamine
abuse, and ''we must confront skyrocketing drug production in
Colombia -- 90 percent of the cocaine in the United States and most
of the heroin on the Eastern seaboard originate in or transit
through that troubled nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine ''remains one of the most dangerous substances
America has ever confronted,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, ''For those who say this is a war, we are
winning.''

<HEADLINE> 40 Sikhs Killed in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATI SINGHPURA, India (AP) -- Suspected Islamic separatists
roused Sikhs from their homes, lined up 40 men and shot them to
death in what India's prime minister called Tuesday an act of
''ethnic cleansing'' in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The killings came Monday night as President Clinton was heading
to India, and as Sikh residents of Chati Singhpura marked the Hindu
''festival of colors'' by daubing each other with colored pastes to
celebrate the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Some colors were still there Tuesday: red against yellow, as
bloodstains smeared a wall, and the white of shrouds of 37 victims
laid out in the temple and its garden. Three other men died of
their wounds at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   India said Kashmiri rebels were responsible for the massacre,
and accused neighboring Pakistan -- which also claims mainly-Muslim
Kashmir -- of supporting the rebels. Both Pakistan and the rebels
denied responsibility and condemned the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking Tuesday in New Delhi at an appearance with
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said Monday's attack
highlighted ''the tremendous suffering this conflict has caused
India.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The violence must end,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, at least two Kashmiri rebels stormed an army
support camp in the Kashmir capital Srinagar, firing automatic
weapons and lobbing grenades as they rushed into the border
security base.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three soldiers of the Border Security Force were believed
wounded. The rebels, members of a suicide squad, holed up on the
ground floor of the base and engaged in a shoot-out with 200
soldiers surrounded the building.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the massacre in Chati Singhpura, 40 miles south of
Srinagar, Indian army troops searched for the gunmen in the hills
and apple and almond orchards near the village.
</P>
<P>
   Angry villagers shouted slogans against Pakistan and Vajpayee,
and threw stones at reporters' cars.
</P>
<P>
   Home Minister L.K. Advani said Islamic separatists were trying
to drive the Sikhs out of Kashmir, just as they had forced out many
Hindus with previous attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the first in the Kashmir conflict to target
Sikhs, whose religion combines elements of Hinduism and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In New Delhi, the prime minister's security adviser, Brijesh
Mishra, identified two militant groups suspected in Monday's
massacre -- Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hezb-ul Mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   ''These outfits are supported by the government of Pakistan,''
Mishra asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's U.N. ambassador Shamshad Ahmed accused Indian
security forces of committing the massacre ''to discredit the
legitimate Kashmiri struggle.'' He repeated Pakistan's calls for
the United Nations and Clinton to get personally involved to
mediate an agreement between India and Pakistan to allow the
Kashmiri people to determine their fate.
</P>
<P>
   India rejects outside interference in the conflict, which has
been stalemated for more than 50 years and has sparked two wars.
</P>
<P>
   In Srinagar, four leading rebel groups disowned the attack and
also blamed it on Indian security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fighting a holy war and Islam does not allow us to
target innocent people,'' Abu Osama, a spokesman for the
Lashkar-e-Toiba group was quoted as saying by Press Trust of India.
His group did claim responsibility for the attack on the border
security base.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the massacre began when gunmen wearing combat
uniforms entered Chati Singhpura just after the village celebrated
Holi, the festival of color.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had taken my dinner and was about to go to bed when my
10-year-old son told me there was some trouble outside,'' said
Balbir Singh, a grocery store owner in Chati Singhpura.
</P>
<P>
   He hid, and ''then I heard rapid gunshots. It went on for five
to six minutes.'' The attackers killed his younger brother, Deedar
Singh. Many Sikh men use the surname Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Gurbachan Singh, a village elder who escaped the massacre
because he was looking after his animals at the time, was stunned
by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still can't make sense why they did this to us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Grand Theft Charge in Oscar Heist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One of two trucking company employees
arrested after 55 Oscar statuettes were stolen was charged Tuesday
with grand theft.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Express employee Lawrence Edward Ledent, 38, was
scheduled to be arraigned later in the day. Prosecutors decided not
to charge the second man, Anthony Keith Hart, 38, because there was
insufficient evidence, said Sandi Gibbons, a district attorney
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars were manufactured by a Chicago company at a cost of
about $18,000 and were shipped on March 3. They arrived at Roadway
Express' warehouse in Bell, Calif., on March 8 and then
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two of the gold-plated statuettes were recovered last
weekend by a man who was scavenging in a trash bin. Whereabouts of
the other three Oscars remained unknown Tuesday, but there were
plenty of statuettes available for Sunday's ceremony.

<HEADLINE> GOP Fight Over Spending, Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reflecting a struggle within the Republican
Party over its election-year message, conservatives are pressuring
GOP colleagues in Congress for spending cuts to make room for
deeper tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   These conservatives, insisting that the party romance its core
conservative voters, have forced delays on both an overall budget
for next year and a $9 billion bill to pay for U.S. operations in
Kosovo and combatting cocaine kingpins in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I view this spending as a betrayal of what I believe in,''
said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the dozen or so states -- largely in the
Midwest -- considered decisive battlegrounds in this fall's
elections are moderate political bastions where big tax and
spending cuts have little appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And these centrists believe the party would fare better letting
its presumptive presidential candidate, George W. Bush, set the
campaign tone by focusing on education and other themes aimed at
moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to do that,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., said of the conservatives' desires for deeper spending and
tax cuts in the proposed $1.8 trillion budget put forth by Budget
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans followed that course, he said, ''We couldn't
possibly do what we want to do'' and also provide more money for
defense, education, health care and other issues that many GOP
lawmakers are hearing about from their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and other party leaders in Congress would prefer sending
President Clinton several small, popular tax bills, complete the
rest of their work quickly, and leave the Capitol early for autumn
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party's trapped in a big argument: Is it a political party
or a movement?'' said GOP consultant Doug Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we do what's necessary to win, versus always standing up
for what we'' believe in, Thompson said. ''Movements make
statements, but don't always win elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending cuts conservatives want would leave more room for
another part of Bush's agenda: a proposed five-year, $483 billion
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Domenici's budget nor a similar spending plan approved
last week by the House Budget Committee would cut taxes as deeply,
and Democrats say the Bush tax plan offers them a juicy target in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the conservative demands, Domenici on Tuesday
indefinitely postponed plans to have his committee begin working on
his spending plan on Wednesday. The House plans to debate its
version the following day.
</P>
<P>
   The House debate has been complicated by language from
conservative freshman Rep. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., included in the
budget committee's proposal. It would forbid any new spending that
would reduce the size of this year's expected $26 billion federal
surplus -- in effect, killing the $9 billion spending bill for
Kosovo, Colombia, Hurricane Floyd recovery efforts and higher
Pentagon fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   In search of compromise, conservatives have been talking to
House leaders about instead devoting a still-undecided part of the
surplus to debt reduction. Even so, the episode spotlights how
internal GOP battles have proven a distraction for the party.
</P>
<P>
   The schism between conservatives and pragmatists has haunted the
party ever since the GOP gained control of Congress in the 1994
elections. And some Republicans say it could harm their prospects
this fall, particularly considering the narrow margins by which the
party holds the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could end up with a big fight that hurts the party
overall,'' said Thompson. ''It takes the focus away from the issues
they should be building in a presidential election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also find themselves divided on other high-profile
items on Congress' agenda in which moderates have strayed from the
leadership's preferences.
</P>
<P>
   These issues include gun control, expanding the rights of
patients of managed health care plans and raising the $5.15 hourly
minimum wage. Those splits underline that, with the polls
indicating a tight election ahead, lawmakers are taking whatever
positions they think they must to get re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Incumbent protection is the rule of the day,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, congressional affairs director for the conservative
Heritage Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Attorney To Fight for Protest Permit  </HEADLINE>
By MEKI COX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An attorney for protesters planning a rally
during the Republican National Convention threatened Tuesday to
file a federal lawsuit if city officials do not approve a
demonstration permit by next month. City officials rejected their
request a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They first said all the sites were reserved for the Republican
National Party. Then they said it's really because of problems with
traffic control,'' said Stefan Presser, a lawyer representing the
Pennsylvania Consumer Action Network. ''The city cannot deny us
access to an entire city.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is spearheading creation of an anti-Republican
coalition named ''R2K'' for a rally on July 30, the eve of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   City and National Park Service officials cited logistical
problems in rejecting the request for a march that would begin at
the Liberty Bell and wind around City Hall to the Benjamin Franklin
Parkway, a major downtown thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   Presser, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union
of Pennsylvania, on Tuesday told City Solicitor Kenneth Trujillo
that his clients are willing to meet with city officials to help
resolve the issue, possibly with a shorter rally that would occupy
fewer lanes of the parkway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're discussing reasonable alternatives, and I hope to get
back to them sometime in early April,'' Trujillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers are aiming to gather thousands of people from
''progressive'' groups, including ACT-UP, which has staged numerous
disruptive rallies in support of increased AIDS funding, the
National Organization for Women and the NAACP, for the rally
several miles from the convention's main site at the First Union
Center.

<HEADLINE> Overcrowded jail, floor mattress await Sharpton in New Jersey jail  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- An overcrowded jail. Mattresses on the
floor. Fellow inmates convicted or awaiting trial for drunken
driving, assault, murder.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations at the Atlantic County Jail won't be plush
for Rev. Al Sharpton, who is to start a 10-day jail term Wednesday
stemming from a racial profiling protest he led in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll treat him like we treat every other inmate,'' said
County Executive Dennis Levinson. ''This is a guy who's all about
equal treatment for everyone, right? Well, he'll get the same
treatment as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, 45, was convicted in November on two counts of
obstructing traffic, a disorderly persons offense, at a July 3
protest on the Atlantic City Expressway. He and 75 others were
arrested after backing up traffic headed into the casino capital on
the busy Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He will be held at the Gerard L. Gormley Justice Facility,
commonly known as the Atlantic County Jail, which is about 12 miles
west of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entry, Sharpton will get an orange jail uniform, a cup, a
spoon and toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Built for 470 inmates, the jail now holds about 970. They live
in 6-by-15-foot cells in which they share toilets. Some inmates
sleep on the floor on cracked vinyl mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   Up at 7 a.m., they have twice-a-day recreation opportunities and
time set aside for court appearance or doctor's appointments,
according to Richard F. Mulvihill, Atlantic County's public safety
director.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't say what Sharpton's accommodations will consist of,
saying only that he'll get no special consideration -- or protective
custody, which the Black Ministers Council had asked for on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the purpose of protective custody, if they don't give
it to me?'' Sharpton said Tuesday. ''Gangsters are given that. It
says more about them than it does me. If they have it for anyone,
clearly, I fall into anyone's definition of high profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are allowed from 1 to 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday and
from 5 to 9 p.m. Monday, and speak to inmates using a telephone as
they sit opposite each other, divided by a glass partition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not someplace you'd like to spend your vacation, let's
put it that way,'' Levinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton apparently doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, he fairly pressed Municipal Judge Bruce Weekes to
jail him, vowing never to pay a fine or the $21,233 in restitution
being sought by Atlantic City police as compensation for officers
who worked holiday weekend overtime for the protest.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his first time behind bars. Sharpton has been convicted
of criminal trespassing four times and served 30 days of a 45-day
term on one of the convictions in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to bring books to read. Among them: ''Pillars of
Fire,'' by Taylor Branch, about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., and several books by theologian Paul Tillich.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has said he plans daily prayer vigils. He will be
accompanied by Martin Luther King III and four minority men who
were shot at by state troopers during a 1998 New Jersey Turnpike
traffic stop when he surrenders at about noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume plan to
visit him while he's in jail, Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   He considers the jail term an opportunity to highlight racial
profiling and what he says are vindictive authorities punishing him
for bringing attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes with the territory. It is in the tradition of civil
rights that if it requires jail, we go. I'm not looking forward to
it or dreading it,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton arrived in Atlantic City on Tuesday night and delivered
a fiery, 15-minute speech at a prayer vigil that attracted about 90
people to Second Baptist Church. In it, he encouraged people to
participate in a noon rally at the jail Wednesday, after which he
will surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what I did because I believed it was necessary and I'll
pay the price for it,'' Sharpton said. He said he was following the
path of Martin Luther King Jr. in going to jail for what he
believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to make me pay for getting the world to recognize
this issue?'' he said, referring to racial profiling. ''And I'm
only regretting that I have but 10 days to give,'' Sharpton said.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Won't Hear Adoption Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES E. BEGGS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- The Oregon Supreme Court on Tuesday let stand
a lower court decision upholding the nation's only voter-passed law
allowing adult adoptees access to their birth records.
</P>
<P>
   The decision clears the way for the law, which easily passed in
November 1998, to take effect April 12 unless a court orders
further delays. The state Supreme Court gave the law's opponents 21
days to seek reconsideration, which seldom is granted, and foes can
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top court refused to review a state Court of Appeals
ruling upholding the law to give adoptees 21 and older access to
the birth certificates, which often contain birth parents' names.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Podwill, a lawyer working with opponents of the law, said
they weren't sure of their next step.
</P>
<P>
   David Malutinok, president of the National Council for Adoption,
said the group ''is obviously disappointed on behalf of birth
mothers and others who are concerned their privacy has not been
taken into account.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The NCFA stands for mutual consent rather than forcing this on
someone,'' he said. ''We're not against adopted adults and their
birth parents finding each other if they both want to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Health Division has more than 2,000 requests from
adoptees seeking their original birth records.
</P>
<P>
   Six anonymous birth mothers challenged the law, arguing it would
violate their rights to privacy. But they've lost three rounds -- a
trial judge and the appeals court rejected their arguments before
the state's top court declined to review the lower court judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Four other states,Tennessee, Kansas, Delaware and Alaska grant
adoptees access to birth records, said Madelyn Freundlich,
executive director of the Adoption Institute, a New York-based
adoption research organization.
</P>
<P>
   While the group doesn't advocate for or against records laws,
she said, surveys indicate that adoptive and birth parents support
the idea of opening records.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who not want contact have been found to represent a very
small minority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adoptees who support the law say they should be given the same
opportunity as everyone else to know who their parents are. They
say that finding their birth parents could help detect potential
health problems and give them a sense of identity.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say birth mothers received promises from doctors,
nurses, lawyers and adoption agencies that their identities would
never be revealed and that most have no desire to be contacted by
children they gave up years ago.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Airlines Cancels Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines lost most of its
communications lines systemwide for about 2{ hours Tuesday when an
independent contractor hit a fiber-optic cable, leading to
cancellations and delays around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers aboard planes were not in danger, but Northwest
temporarily suspended boarding additional flights until the problem
was fixed, said spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 of the airline's 1,700 daily flights were canceled
systemwide, and an undetermined number were delayed. Schubert said
communications lines went down just after 2 p.m. CST, affecting
reservations and baggage information and the airline's electronic
ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
   Major delays were reported in Detroit, where about 30 flights
were canceled, according to Northwest spokesman Doug Killian.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 were canceled in Minneapolis, with the remainder
scattered around the system. Some delays also were experienced in
Singapore and Bangkok, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's Web site also was out of service because of the
severed cable.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Bothun, a spokesman for U S West, the telecom that owns the
fiber-optic cable, said the line was cut in Eagan by a contractor
from McLeod USA, a local and long-distance telecommunications
company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest officials said the airline expected to be back to
normal operations by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers scheduled to fly on Northwest Tuesday evening were
given the option of rescheduling their flights.

<HEADLINE> Gore Attacks Republicans on Census  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore on Tuesday challenged George W. Bush's
concern for minorities, saying they are shortchanged by a census
that congressional Republicans refuse to modernize in order to get
a more accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say to Governor Bush, if you really believe that
every American counts, it's time to stand up to the operatives in
your own party and support a census that counts every American,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Gore have long supported changing the census to
incorporate sampling, a way of statistically adjusting actual
headcounts to account for populations with traditionally low
response rates, such as minority groups in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have fought sampling, which could lower
headcounts in GOP-heavy areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McLellan defended the headcount method, and
accused Gore of playing politics. ''Given the Clinton-Gore
administration's history of using nonpartisan government agencies
to further the political agenda of Democrats, subjecting the census
to the risk of partisan manipulation will do nothing to restore
public confidence in the ethics of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates disagree on the census, Bush and Gore
reacted similarly to the U.S. Supreme Court saying the federal
government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an additive drug.
Both called on Congress to pass legislation to further restrict
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose sister died of lung cancer, called on Congress to
approve a law to give the federal Food and Drug Administration
authority to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco is one of the most addictive substances known to man
and should be regulated as a drug,'' Gore said. ''... It is time
for the Republican Congress and George Bush to show their
independence from Big Tobacco and do the right thing by passing
legislation that has had bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign released a statement saying the Texas governor
''believes decisions about tobacco regulation should be made by
Congress and state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes that Congress should pass tough laws to keep
tobacco out of the hands of kids, similar to strict anti-teen
smoking laws he advocated and signed in Texas,'' the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
   On the census issue, the government has said the 1990 count,
which did not use sampling, missed 8.4 million people and
double-counted 4.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled last year that raw census numbers must
be used to reapportion congressional seats in the House, but left
open the possibility that sampling could be used for other
purposes, such as the data used to decide the distribution of
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested the old counting method is outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a nation of 250 million people, it's ridiculous to believe
that the most accurate way to count everybody is by sending out
people with clipboards and pencils,'' he told 150 staff members of
the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a community service center on
Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting sampling, he added, ''has nothing to do with meeting
the needs of people who are homeless or children who are in Head
Start. ... It has to do with politics. It has to do with political
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore devoted the rest of Tuesday to fund-raising for his
campaign, with one $200,000 affair and two $100,000 benefits, one
in Manhattan and two in New Jersey, home of Gore's defeated
Democratic rival Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   At a restaurant in Englewood, Gore won the pledged support of
top Bradley backers, including campaign chairman Doug Berman,
former Gov. Brendan Byrne and state Senate Democratic Leader
Richard Codey, the state chairman of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has the leadership and experience to make a difference
for working families throughout New Jersey and America,'' said
Berman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, standing beside Berman and Codey, called for unity among
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we are united we have the capacity to communicate well
with all of our people,'' Gore said, praising Bradley for his focus
on health care reform and battling racism.

<HEADLINE> Bahamas Whales Deaths Prompt Probe  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA ROBERTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Bahamas (AP) -- Eight whales beached and died soon
after the U.S. Navy conducted anti-submarine exercises off the
northern Bahamas, prompting an investigation and calls for an end
to such exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy said Tuesday that there was no evidence to link the
whale deaths to last week's exercise testing sonar detection of
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Cmdr. Greg Smith said the sonar tests were scheduled only
one day and took place from about 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. March 15 off
Abaco Island.
</P>
<P>
   Marine biologist Ken Balcomb of the Earthwatch environmental
group said beachings began that same day and within two days at
least 14 whales had grounded themselves on Abaco, Grand Bahama to
the north, and Eleuthera to the south. Eight died, prompting
investigations by Bahamian and U.S. scientists and authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''A whale beaching in the Bahamas is a once-in-a-decade
occurrence,'' said Balcomb, an American who has been studying
whales around Abaco island for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be making recommendations to the Bahamian government
that these sort of exercises be terminated,'' he said. ''The fact
that it coincides with the military exercises cannot be just
coincidental.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy spokesman said there was no evidence linking the
two events and the Navy planned to continue such tests.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no suggestion we have, and no scientific data, that
the testing that we are doing was in any way linked to the current,
unfortunate demise of great mammals,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''My understanding of the actual locations would put the island
between the operations where the 'sonobuoys' were located and where
the whales eventually beached themselves,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Rose of the Washington-based Humane Society of the United
States, maintained the signals could still do damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''These signals, depending on frequency, could travel quite a
distance and could even wrap around the island,'' said Rose, a
marine mammal scientist. ''One could argue that they fled the area
where the sonar was being transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. marine biologist here to investigate, Charles
Potter of the Smithsonian Institute, said the number of whales
beached is ''extremely unusual. But he said the postmortems showed
the whales had suffered no physical damage, such as broken ear
drums.
</P>
<P>
   Balcomb said the mammals included several deep-water beaked
whales, goose beaked whales measuring 16-19 feet, dense beaked
whales measuring 10-13 feet, baleen whales measuring up to 27 feet
and some small minke whales.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Breynan, director of the Bahamian Fisheries Department,
said he was working with U.S. scientists to try to determine the
cause. Breynan said his department kept no records of beached
whales but added: ''I am not aware of any similar incident (having
occurred) in the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said further tests on the dead whales would be carried out in
the United States, a process that could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the exercise was testing for upgrades of what the
Navy calls the Directional Command Activated Sonobuoy System.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise involved a Navy P-3 aircraft dropping two buoys
north of Abaco, one as close as 35 miles to the island, the other
70 to 75 miles from the island. One buoy emitted a sonar signal
which was received by the other, and a submarine was moving between
the two buoys.
</P>
<P>
   He said the exercise had nothing to do with low frequency active
sonar, a new and controversial system that transmits sonar pulses
so loud they can match the roar of a rocket launch.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, responsible for
overseeing all U.S. actions that could affect the environment at
home or abroad, said it approved the Navy's environmental
assessment for its exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Gentry, coordinator of the service's acoustics team, said
the exercises shouldn't have affected the whales. ''Yet we have
beached whales.''
</P>
<P>
   The service has also sent veterinarians and acoustic experts to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Marine scientists have been expressing growing concern in recent
years about the possible effects of man-made noises on marine
mammals who rely on their hearing perhaps more than their sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already know from preliminary research that's been done
that there are some problems with man-made noise in the marine
environment,'' said Rose of the Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   However, other experts have been quick to point out that none of
the research has been able to conclusively blame man-made noise for
events such as the whale beachings in the Bahamas.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Rep. Seeks Alcohol Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Rep. Philip M. Crane, the most senior Republican
in the House and a former presidential candidate, said Tuesday he
is taking a 30-day leave of absence from Congress to seek treatment
for alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over a period of time I have sensed an increased dependence on
alcohol,'' Crane, 69, said in a statement. ''This dependence has
taken a toll on my health and other aspects of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane, a staunch conservative first elected in 1969 from
Chicago's northwest suburbs, holds the second-ranking slot on the
powerful, tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. He is
chairman of its subcommittee on trade.
</P>
<P>
   His seniority placed him in line to take over the panel next
year after the current chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas,
retires. However, Crane already faced a strong challenge for the
job from Rep. Bill Thomas of California, the third-ranking
Republican on Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the trade subcommittee, Crane has fervently
promoted U.S. trade with countries such as China and Chile, as well
as the nations of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. He also has
been a decades-long promoter of a flat tax. He was a GOP
presidential candidate in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's spokesman Ted Schelenski said the congressman has not
given any consideration to retiring. He added: ''I doubt that
anybody is saying he's going to cure himself in 30 days. It's
probably something he's going to work with the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane was unopposed in Tuesday's Illinois primary.

<HEADLINE> Japan, S.Korea Wary on U.N. Report  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Health researchers and government
officials in Japan and South Korea reacted cautiously Tuesday to a
U.N. report suggesting their countries would have to accept
significant numbers of foreigners to prevent populations from
decreasing over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said women -- not necessarily more immigrants --
could help fill the gap in the shrinking labor force, which would
maintain economic productivity and provide resources to care for
the increasingly aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many highly educated women who become housewives
instead of getting a job because of the gender discrimination. The
government is working to create a more favorable working
environment for women,'' said Kim Seung-kwon, a health researcher
at the state-run Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. officials countered that such a response wouldn't do
anything to prevent population decline and might make fertility
rates, already low, decline further as more women choose to work
rather than raise large families.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some immigration is needed to prevent population decline in
all cases,'' studied by the U.N. Population Division for the
report, said Joseph Chamie, the division's director.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Tuesday on ''Replacement Migration,'' found
that the populations across Europe and Japan and South Korea would
decline without continued or increased migration flows.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the pace of population aging in South
Korea is expected to be one of the fastest in the world. Without
migration, the over-65 population is expected to increase from 5.6
percent of the total to 24.7 percent in 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the working-age population -- which supports retirees
with taxes to fund health care benefits and other retirement plans
-- is expected to decline after reaching a high of 36.3 million in
2020 to 30.4 million in 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Japan would need 10 million immigrants
every year for the next 50 years to maintain the current
working-age to retirement-age ratio. Without migration, figures
show it would be necessary to raise the retirement age to 77 to
maintain the ratio.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Japan's Health Ministry said the study was based
on the assumption that only immigration could solve the problem of
the country's surging number of retirees. The official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said more use of women workers should be
considered as one of the options to care for retirees in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The latest U.N. study ''is nothing but a barometer,'' the
official said, although he added that it could be useful when
considering whether to ease immigration regulations in Japan, which
is relatively closed to foreign workers than other advanced
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chamie cautioned that the United Nations was not making
recommendations, merely pointing out future demographic trends and
options.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- A city councilwoman was quoted as saying
she opposes renaming a street after the Rev. Martin Luther King
because she questions whether ''he really accomplished things'' or
just ''caused a lot of riots.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Poole told the newspaper Florida Today on Monday that
renaming a street after the slain civil rights leader could tarnish
Melbourne's image because ''the one thing it says to a lot of
people is it's a bad section to go to because it's usually in a
section that's all black.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder if he really accomplished things, or if he just
stirred people up and caused a lot of riots,'' the newspaper quoted
Poole as saying.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Poole backtracked somewhat, saying she didn't use
the word ''riots.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I don't agree with marchers and protesters,'' Poole
told WFTV in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Today stood by the story, said Bob Stover, the managing
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Local NAACP leaders said that they were surprised by Poole's
comments and that the councilwoman misunderstood King's work. They
planned to attend next week's council meeting at which the street
proposal is scheduled to come up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. King was a civil rights leader and civil rights stands for
everybody, not just black folks, said Carole Floyd, president of
the south Brevard County branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Opponent Digs up Own Dirt  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN McMILLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's latest political opponent
has made character an issue -- his own character.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jack E. Robinson III opened his campaign to unseat
the 37-year Senate veteran Tuesday by issuing an 11-page report
detailing all of the dirt he could dig up on himself.
</P>
<P>
   It includes topics such as ''Liquor,'' in which he expresses a
preference for scotch, gin and brandy, and ''Restraining Order,''
in which he defends himself against allegations made by a former
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am willing to basically put my personal background out there
for everyone to review and I would trust the citizens of the
commonwealth to make their own decisions at the appropriate time,''
Robinson said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a 39-year-old wealthy business executive and political
neophyte, reports in exhaustive detail on a drunken driving arrest
in the mid-1980s and a relationship that ended in a restraining
order against him.
</P>
<P>
   His dirty laundry list also includes flunking the bar twice in
New York and once in Texas (''I didn't really study for them'') and
being accused of plagiarism (a court ruled against him and his book
on Pan Am airlines was never released).
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's awfully tough to be introduced this way. The big
advantage is, of course, he's running against Teddy Kennedy,''
Republican consultant Charley Manning said. He added: ''Let's face
it, even with the Robinson report, Teddy's resume on all these
hijinks far outweigh anything Jackie did.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's background was too much for the state's top
Republican, Gov. Paul Cellucci, who withdrew his endorsement of
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sheer volume of the allegations and the disturbing nature
of some of these allegations makes it pretty impossible for him to
get this campaign off the ground,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican State Committee joined Cellucci in withdrawing
its support.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement put out following the governor's announcement,
Robinson said he was disappointed, but also felt liberated to ''run
a John McCain style campaign, free from the restrictions, good old
boy rules and double-crossed tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he wasn't looking to bring up Kennedy's
much-storied past. But he asked reporters to treat all candidates
equally.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy spokesman Will Keyser declined to comment on Robinson's
report or his candidacy. ''The senator runs for an office, not
against his opponent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Business
School who spent most of his business career in the airline and
cellular industries, lives in Greenwich, Conn., but said he is
moving this week to his parents' home in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was born in Boston and educated at schools throughout
the state, Robinson shrugged off any suggestions that he was a
carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of Robinson's past surfaced almost immediately after
he confirmed he would run for the Senate last week.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Robinson said he was stopped by police in Boston
after having a couple of glasses of wine with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   While he was being searched, the officer found a ''martial arts
implement'' in his coat. Robinson said he didn't know how it got
there. A charge of carrying a dangerous weapon eventually was
dismissed, and a breath-test showing only 0.04 did not lead to a
drunken driving charge, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the restraining order, Robinson said the woman he called
Jane was upset because he wanted to break off their relationship
and made up the sexual assault allegation against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not a womanizer. I am not a groper,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed neither he nor Kennedy has a ''stellar'' driving
record.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 68, pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident
after a car he was driving plunged into the waters off Martha's
Vineyard in 1969, killing Mary Jo Kopechne.	   Another embarrassment came during
the rape trial of his nephew
William Kennedy Smith. According to testimony, the then-divorced
senator had corralled his son and Smith to go drinking at a trendy
Palm Beach nightclub the evening his nephew was later accused of
raping a woman on the beach.

<HEADLINE> Heart failure trial stopped due to significant survival benefits  </HEADLINE>
By MEKI COX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The first large-scale study using the heart
drug carvedilol in patients with advanced heart failure was halted
more than a year early after preliminary results showed a
significant reduction in the risk of death, researchers announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could quell long-standing concerns that beta
blockers can worsen heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical committee overseeing the four-year study unanimously
agreed that because the risk of death was so drastically reduced,
it would be inappropriate for doctors to further withhold
treatment, said Milton Packer, the principal investigator of the
study and professor of medicine at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, a type of beta blocker, helps reduce the heart's
workload. It was previously only approved for patients with minor
or moderate heart problems, giving them an increased rate of
survival at 34 percent, Packer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're now looking at treatment for advanced cases with effects
that appear larger than that,'' Packer said. ''The results were so
compelling and so large, we believe we could not continue to give
people just placebos. We hope these results encourage physicians to
use this very valuable drug and lead to a broad base effect on a
very important public health problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Final data on the study was not available, but Packer said the
specifics will be submitted for approval to the Food and Drug
Administration soon. He noted that the drug should not be used on
patients in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Heart failure involves a damaged or overworked heart that cannot
pump efficiently. It afflicts an estimated 4.8 million Americans
and is a leading cause of hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Heart failure caused 45,419 deaths in 1997, the latest available
figures, according to the American Heart Association. The symptoms
often include breathlessness and swelling in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional treatment includes diuretics to reduce fluid
buildup and drugs called ACE inhibitors to dilate blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiology doctors said the preliminary data on the new study
was promising and should remove the fear that certain doctors have
had from using beta blockers because it was unclear whether
patients could handle the drug dosages.
</P>
<P>
   In this study, ''patients were sicker than patients in previous
studies, so the results are particularly striking,'' said Dr. David
Meyerson, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and
national spokesman for the American Heart Association. ''This gives
added impetus to make certain all patients who can tolerate it
should be on (the drug), given the functional benefits and
mortality benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some doctors would rather withhold using the drug in
clinical practice until the specific details are provided, said Dr.
Srinivas Murali, director of transplantation cardiology at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He participated in
carvedilol studies before the FDA approved it for minor or moderate
heart failures.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians currently prescribe carvedilol in 10 percent of their
patients. Packer now suggests doctors use it on 80 percent of their
patients to prolong life.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,200 patients in more than a dozen countries,
including Canada, the United Kingdom and France, were involved in
the study, which began in 1997. Carvedilol, whose brand name is
Coreg, is marketed by SmithKline Beecham, which has its U.S.
headquarters in Philadelphia, and Nutley, N.J.-based Hoffman-La
Roche Inc.

<HEADLINE> China: Falun Gong Crackdown Backed  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- China claimed Tuesday that it had the support of a
majority of nations for its treatment of the Falun Gong spiritual
movement in the face of a possible U.N. human-rights resolution
condemning the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai dismissed U.S. plans for an
anti-China resolution in the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission
as an election-year ploy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some people will use Falun Gong as an excuse to table a
draft resolution on China in the Commission on Human Rights to
support the evil cult, they will only end up with ruined
reputations and an indecent result,'' Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
   A top U.S. official said in Washington on Monday that there is a
''significant possibility'' that the resolution would succeed this
year after a number of years in which China has been able to use
its influence with developing countries to block condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has singled out the treatment of Falun Gong as
one of the reasons for its resolution plans.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders banned the multimillion-member group last July.
Thousands of practitioners have been detained and leaders given
jail terms of up to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has attracted millions of Chinese with a
combination of slow-motion exercises and blend of Taoist and
Buddhist cosmology and ideas drawn from founder Li Hongzhi, an
ex-government clerk who now lives in New York. Practitioners say it
promotes health and morality.
</P>
<P>
   In a presentation to diplomats and reporters, Qiao showed a
video documentary on the movement, which compared it with suicide
cults in recent years whose followers have perished in Guyana,
Switzerland and California.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evil cult is a phenomenon in many countries,'' he said,
noting the death Friday of several hundred members of a Ugandan
sect. He said Falun Gong brainwashes followers, harms society and
creates public disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   ''The outlawing of the Falun Gong by the Chinese government has
won the support of the majority of countries and their governments.
We appreciate this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong representatives are in Geneva to urge the commission
to address their plight. On Monday they protested silently during
the body's opening session. Some 350 practitioners performed
meditative exercises on the square in outside the compound of the
U.N. European headquarters.

<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- An intense undersea earthquake with an
estimated magnitude of 6.2 has been recorded in the Maluku
archipelago in eastern Indonesia, the Hong Kong Observatory said
Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor recorded Tuesday afternoon was centered north of
Halmahera island in the Pacific Ocean, the observatory said. There
were no reports of tsunami, destructive tidal waves caused by
earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Powell Rules Out Vice President Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Gen. Colin Powell said Tuesday he
would not run for vice president, but did not rule out possible
service in the Cabinet of the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question during a broadcast from the Reserve
Officers Association, Powell said he gave the idea of running for
office ''the greatest consideration you can give to an issue,'' but
he said he stands by his 1995 decision not to run for president and
to stay out of elective politics.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 62 and a registered Republican, is now being mentioned
as a possible running mate for George W. Bush, the likely
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to have a certain feeling for it, a commitment,
passion,'' said Powell. ''And if I'd said I had it, I wouldn't have
been honest to myself, I wouldn't have been honest to the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no desire for political office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not rule out serving in the new Cabinet. The former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been mentioned as a
possible candidate for secretary of state or defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any president that comes to you and says, 'I need help, and
Would you be interested in performing this job?' you have to see
whether or not it's something you feel you can do for the
president,'' Powell said. ''Whether or not you say yes is another
matter, but you have to consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell currently divides his time between public speaking and
running ''America's Promise,'' a nonprofit organization dedicated
to youth issues.

<HEADLINE> Bruins 4, Lightning 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Brian Rolston, acquired earlier this month in the
trade that sent Ray Bourque to Colorado, had a goal and an assist
and Sergei Samsonov added three assists in Boston Bruins' 4-0
victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Tallas made 16 saves and improved his career mark against
the Lightning to 8-1-1 before he was replaced by John Grahame for
the final period because of a stiff neck. Tampa Bay has won just
once in 15 games at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Knuble gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead in the first period when
he deflected Rolston's slap shot from inside the point past Tampa
Bay goaltender Zac Bierk on the power play. It was Knuble's 11th
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 2-0 when Rolston notched his 14th on a power play
2:10 into the second period. Rolston's slap shot from just outside
the left circle gave him three goals and three assists in seven
games since joining the team on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Thornton scored his 21st midway through the second when his
backhander slipped off Bierk's shoulder and into the net. Mikko
Eloranta added his sixth early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Bierk (3-3) finished with 38 saves for the Lightning, which
finished a successful five-game road trip at 2-2-1. Tampa Bay has
just six road wins this season, which is the franchise low for a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas (4-10-4) was injured early in the second period and
remained on the ice for several minutes after Todd Warriner tripped
going to the net and collided with the goalie. Tallas appeared to
jam his back and net on the post, but remained in the game until
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins defense tightened up after Tallas was hit and allowed
seven shots on goal over the final two periods. Grahame stopped
three shots.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Shawn McEachern and Andreas Dackell each
had two goals and an assist and Tom Barrasso made 23 saves in his
Corel Centre debut Tuesday night as the Ottawa Senators routed the
Atlanta Thrashers 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Juneau, Radek Bonk and Jason York also scored for Ottawa.
Vaclav Prospal had four assists and Daniel Alfredsson added two.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette scored a short-handed goal for Atlanta, which was
coming off a big win over Toronto on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso acquired at last week's trade deadline, earned his
first win in a Senators uniform after losing his debut at Vancouver
on March 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators scored a franchise-record six times in the first,
beating their previous mark of five goals in a period set March 8
against Tampa Bay. Ottawa also scored five goals in a period Nov.
25, 1999 against the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers goaltender Damian Rhodes allowed goals on the second
and third shots by his old team before being briefly replaced by
Norm Maracle less than four minutes into the first. Rhodes returned
and allowed four more goals in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa outshot Atlanta 35-24 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 3-1 late in the first period, McEachern, Dackell and
York scored in a 1:20 span, surpassing the club mark of 1:27 set on
Feb. 20, 1996 against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Juneau left the game with an injured right knee and did not
return. His status was not known.

<HEADLINE> Md. Hostage Standoff in 5th Day  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- After days of sporadic gunfire, a hostage
drama that has shut down a neighborhood grew quiet Tuesday as
police continued negotiating with a murder suspect who was holding
three people.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Bill Toohey said someone may be injured in the
apartment, but added: ''The issue is a little bit murky.''
</P>
<P>
   A single shot was fired inside the apartment Monday afternoon,
and Toohey said immediately afterward that it did not appear anyone
was hurt. But he conceded that negotiators were relying on Joseph
Palczynski, who is believed to have four weapons and an unknown
amount of ammunition, for information.
</P>
<P>
   Toohey said Tuesday that the process was ''like groping our way
through a dimly lit room.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Friday when Palczynski allegedly forced his
way into a home in a Baltimore suburb and took three people
hostage, including the mother of his former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski is accused of kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, Tracy
Whitehead, on March 7, killing four people over a two-day period
and leading police on a manhunt for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokeswoman Vickie Warehime said Tuesday night that
telephone conversations were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Palczynski could be catching catnaps during lulls in
communication with negotiators that sometimes last hours.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff is wearing down the patience of residents in the
four-block area surrounding the home where Palczynski was holed up.
Police cordoned off the area but allowed some residents to leave
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One resident was arrested Monday while trying to sneak back into
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Others have found ways to reach their families without getting
in trouble. Using a police escort, one neighbor tossed plastic bags
of groceries over a fence to his wife and two children trapped in
their home.

<HEADLINE> Russia Mulls Nuclear Treaty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Top security officials and members of parliament
discussed the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty at a
closed-door meeting Tuesday, and issued a statement encouraging the
full parliament to ratify the document.
</P>
<P>
   START II, signed in 1993, limits the United States and Russia to
about 3,000 nuclear warheads each but has been stalled in Russia's
lower house of parliament, or Duma, waiting ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line deputies argue the country needs a stiff nuclear
shield to compensate for shabby conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   But military and foreign policy leaders have said they support
the treaty, in part because Russia cannot afford to maintain a
large nuclear arsenal, and regularly prod the Duma toward
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and members of three Duma committees attended the
meeting, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of START II is ''in the interest of guaranteeing
the national security of the Russian Federation and strengthening
strategic stability in the world,'' the statements says.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting also recommended the Duma ratify
amendments to START II concerning enforcement, and amendments to
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States are currently at odds over a U.S.
proposal to scale-back the ABM treaty to allow the United States to
built a limited missile defense system.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Kendall Gill scored 24 points and held Vince
Carter dunk-free as the New Jersey Nets beat the Toronto Raptors
100-93 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, guarded by Gill for most of the game and frequently
double-teamed, had 23 points on 5-for-18 shooting as the Raptors
lost for only the second time in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Newman scored seven straight points on two jumpers and a
three-point play to give the Nets an 84-75 lead early in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors closed within four on Tracy McGrady's dunk off a
missed free throw with just under six minutes remaining, but
Stephon Marbury made a driving layup and a three-point play to give
the Nets a 91-82 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Doug Christie followed with a 3-pointer to close
within six, but Gill followed with a jumper to make it 93-85. Keith
Van Horn's driving layup made it 95-87 with 2:40 remaining, and
Marbury's driving layup with 1:29 to go made it 97-89.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had 18 points and seven assists. Newman finished with 14
points for the Nets, who shot 51 percent from the field to move
within two games of Orlando for the eighth and final playoff spot
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy McGrady had 22 points and 12 rebounds for Toronto, which
shot 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors were 14-for-14 from the line as they led 50-46 at
the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After a steal in the first quarter, Marbury had a clear
path to the basket but his dunk attempt clanked off the rim. Gill,
trailing on the play, jammed it in for him. ... Just before the
first half ended, a young fan yelled: ''Hey Carter, we haven't seen
a dunk yet.'' ... Kerry Kittles left the game in the first half
after banging his left cheek against Keith Van Horn's shoulder. He
did not return. X-rays were negative.

   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Marcus Hicks scored 16 points and Rahim
Lockhart muscled his way to 13 as Mississippi pushed Southwest
Missouri State right out of the National Invitation Tournament with
a 70-48 second-round victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 Hicks and 6-8 Lockhart didn't have any height
advantage on the Bears, but they proved to be too strong in the
paint and on the glass for Southwest Missouri to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart led Ole Miss (19-13) with 13 rebounds, 11 in the first
half, and Hicks had seven, as the Rebels' physical play at both
ends proved too much for Southwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears (23-11) had cut the Ole Miss lead to 49-39 with 12:25
left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rebels scored 10 straight points, the final six on
3-pointers by Emmanuel Wade and Jason Harrison, to lead 59-39 with
7:46 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels, who held North Carolina Charlotte to just 27 percent
shooting in a first-round NIT victory, held the Bears to 39 percent
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   William Fontleroy led the Bears with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Phillips, Southwest Missouri's leading scorer, had just
seven points, all coming at the beginning of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison had 11 points and Lataryl Williams 10 for the Rebels.

<HEADLINE> Gore shores up Bradley support in rival's home state  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore went to Bill
Bradley's home state to raise funds and join forces with supporters
of his former Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give the credit to Senator Bill Bradley for the unity of
purpose that is manifest in this room,'' Gore told Bradley backers
who stood beside him Tuesday at an Englewood restaurant. ''I'm
grateful that we are all one team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign manager, Douglas Berman, and the cochairman
of New Jersey's Bradley campaign, state Sen. Richard Codey,
appeared with Gore at the reception and two fund-raisers at private
homes to officially give their support to the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore has the leadership and experience to make a difference
for working families throughout New Jersey and America,'' said
Berman.
</P>
<P>
   And Codey, the state Senate Democratic leader, told Gore, ''I
don't know any elected Democrat in New Jersey who was for Bradley
who is not going to vote for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore praised Bradley, the former New Jersey senator who based
his campaign here, for his work to end racism and reform health
care and the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a good man and my friend,'' Gore said. ''I thought that
he brought a passion and eloquence to the issue of closing the
racial divide that is just unparalleled in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president then pledged to take on many of Bradley's
issues and told New Jerseyans that he and his rival stood for many
of the same things. He recalled Bradley's prediction that the next
president would appoint three or four Supreme Court justices during
his term.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to see the Constitution interpreted one way or
another for the next 30 or 40 years, depending on who is elected
president,'' Gore said. ''The kind of justices I would appoint are
the kind of justices that Bill Bradley would appoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore later attended two fund-raisers at private Englewood homes.
One, a $1,000-a-person reception at Joyce and Jim Demetrakis' home,
raised $100,000. The second a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser raised
$200,000 at Mark and Hava Finkel's home.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Gore challenged George W. Bush's concern for
minorities, saying they are shortchanged by a census that
congressional Republicans refuse to modernize in order to get a
more accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say to Governor Bush, if you really believe that
every American counts, it's time to stand up to the operatives in
your own party and support a census that counts every American,''
the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Gore have long supported changing the census to
incorporate sampling, a way of statistically adjusting actual
headcounts to account for populations with traditionally low
response rates, such as minority groups in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have fought sampling, which could lower
headcounts in GOP-heavy areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McLellan defended the headcount method, and
accused Gore of playing politics. ''Given the Clinton-Gore
administration's history of using nonpartisan government agencies
to further the political agenda of Democrats, subjecting the census
to the risk of partisan manipulation will do nothing to restore
public confidence in the ethics of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates disagree on the census, Bush and Gore
reacted similarly to the U.S. Supreme Court saying the federal
government lacks authority to regulate tobacco as an addictive
drug. Both called on Congress to pass legislation to further
restrict tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose sister died of lung cancer, called on Congress to
approve a law to give the federal Food and Drug Administration
authority to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tobacco is one of the most addictive substances known to man
and should be regulated as a drug,'' Gore said. ''... It is time
for the Republican Congress and George Bush to show their
independence from Big Tobacco and do the right thing by passing
legislation that has had bipartisan support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign released a statement saying the Texas governor
''believes decisions about tobacco regulation should be made by
Congress and state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes that Congress should pass tough laws to keep
tobacco out of the hands of kids, similar to strict anti-teen
smoking laws he advocated and signed in Texas,'' the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
   On the census issue, the government has said the 1990 count,
which did not use sampling, missed 8.4 million people and
double-counted 4.4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled last year that raw census numbers must
be used to reapportion congressional seats in the House, but left
open the possibility that sampling could be used for other
purposes, such as the data used to decide the distribution of
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested the old counting method is outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a nation of 250 million people, it's ridiculous to believe
that the most accurate way to count everybody is by sending out
people with clipboards and pencils,'' he told 150 staff members of
the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a community service center on
Manhattan's Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting sampling, he added, ''has nothing to do with meeting
the needs of people who are homeless or children who are in Head
Start. ... It has to do with politics. It has to do with political
power.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks 82, Heat 77  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jim Jackson scored on two drives in the final
1:10 and the Atlanta Hawks snapped a four-game losing streak with a
82-77 victory over Miami on Tuesday night, the Heat's second loss
in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing throughout the final quarter, Miami tied the game
at 75 on Don Majerle's 3-pointer with 1:28 remaining. But Jackson
picked up a loose ball and drove into the lane to put the Hawks
ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning missed in close for Miami, giving Jackson a
chance to put the Hawks in control. He found another seam in the
Heat's defense, banking in a shot for a 79-75 lead with 33.5
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added two free throws with 6.3 seconds left to clinch
the victory. He finished with 15 points, as did teammate Alan
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was noticeably ragged after losing 110-89 to the Los
Angeles Lakers the previous night at home, snapping a five-game
winning streak. This defeat was especially crucial since the Heat
began the night 3 1-2 games behind Indiana for best record in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, who had lost 11 of their previous 13 games, won for
the first time since waiving top scorer Isaiah Rider. Both teams
shot only 38 percent, with the Heat managing just 35 points in the
second half and going nearly six minutes in the final quarter
before scoring its first basket.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Mashburn led Miami with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, with the third-worst record in the East, put its youth
movement into full force. In addition to starting rookie Jason
Terry at the point, another first-year player, Dion Glover, played
a season-high 22 minutes. He scored four points.
</P>
<P>
Notes LaPhonso Ellis had three rebounds, giving him 3,002 for his
career. ... The Hawks used 11 players at least seven minutes and
their bench outscored the Heat reserves 24-10. ... Atlanta has
surrendered fewer points in only one other game this season, an
83-70 victory over the New York Knicks. ... Miami has still won
nine of its last 11 against the Hawks. ... Atlanta was actually
outshot 38.3 percent to 37.9 percent, marking only the second time
in 32 games the Hawks have won with worse shooting than their
opponent.

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Wednesday
morning after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates. The
Tokyo stock market's main index rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 106.71 yen at late morning, up 0.23 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 106.93
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 56.63
points, or 0.29 percent, to 19,658.99 at the end of the morning
session. On Tuesday, the average closed up 36.04 points, or 0.18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate Tuesday by a
quarter point -- the fifth increase since June -- in a preemptive
measure to contain any budding inflationary pressure in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.55 yen, down
from 103.52 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed action met Wall Street's expectations of a modest
increase in interest rates, a move that convinced investors the
central bank was winning its battle to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices opened higher following a rally in
New York. But players in Tokyo said active selling of
Internet-related and high-tech issues was limiting the positive
effects of the surge on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Kazunori Jinnai, a senior equity division manager at Daiwa SB
Capital Markets, said investors were seeking to take profits in
information technology issues following the recent recovery in that
sector.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.10 points
to 10,907.34 at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 16.08 points, or 0.99 percent, to 1,656.47.
The TOPIX closed down 1.67 points, or 0.10 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8800 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8650 percent. Its
price fell 0.13 point to 99.32.

   The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Dorsett, who spent the last four

   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- Heads of state from four African

<HEADLINE> Flyers 2, Predators 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Philadelphia rookie Simon Gagne
continued his hot streak with a goal and an assist and rookie Brian
Boucher made 27 saves in the Flyers' 2-0 win over the Nashville
Predators on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne needed just 3:24 in the second period to collect his two
points. The 20-year-old center set up John LeClair's power-play
blast from the right boards that sailed under Nashville goaltender
Mike Dunham's glove at 7:18.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gagne took care of matters himself, whacking the rebound of
his own shot off the goalpost and by Dunham at 10:42. The rookie
has six points in the last three games, and his 19 goals are second
among NHL rookies to the Rangers' Michael York.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia defenseman Eric Desjardins assisted on both goals,
giving him 50 points on the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers have the NHL's best power play at 22 percent, but
that includes 10 power-play goals from injured captain Eric Lindros
(migraines), who missed his fifth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia nearly took a first-period lead when Keith Primeau
had a point-blank shot at an open right side of the net with Dunham
down. Nashville's Greg Johnson deflected the shot over the
crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher stopped the Ville Peltonen's backhander on a 2-on-1
break later in the period. He faced just 14 shots the final two
periods for his third career shutout in 29 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers came in limping. Nashville was returning home after a
very successful road trip during which the Predators went 2-0-1-1.
But Philadelphia was too strong Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville has only 13 wins at home in 36 games, the same number
of victories as the Predators have on the road.

<HEADLINE> Md. Hostages Safe After Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Police entered a house where a murder
suspect had been holding three hostages since Friday and all of the
hostages were safe Tuesday night, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the hostages are safe. That is all the information I
right now,'' police spokeswoman Vickie Warehime said. ''Again all
of the hostages are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Friday when Joseph Palczynski allegedly
forced his way into a home in a Baltimore suburb and took three
people hostage, including the mother of his former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski is accused of kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, Tracy
Whitehead, on March 7, killing four people over a two-day period
and leading police on a manhunt for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff is wearing down the patience of residents in the
four-block area surrounding the home where Palczynski was holed up.
Police cordoned off the area but allowed some residents to leave
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One resident was arrested Monday while trying to sneak back into
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Others have found ways to reach their families without getting
in trouble. Using a police escort, one neighbor tossed plastic bags
of groceries over a fence to his wife and two children trapped in
their home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored 29 points and Terrell
Brandon added 24 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the
Cleveland Cavaliers 111-107 in overtime Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon also tied his career-high with 16 assists as the Wolves
spoiled the return of Cavs' first-year coach Randy Wittman, who
served as an assistant in Minnesota from 1994-99, where he suffered
through 230 losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves hadn't beaten the Cavs at home since March 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smith's baseline jumper gave Minnesota a 107-105 lead with
44 seconds left in overtime, and Cleveland's Andre Miller missed a
short jumper with 10 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett's two free throws at 8.6 seconds made it 109-105, but
Bob Sura's rebound basket with two seconds left made it a two-point
game again. Brandon was fouled with nine-tenths of a second left
and sank both shots.
</P>
<P>
   Lamond Murray's 16 points led the Cavs, who also got 15 each
from Shawn Kemp and Wesley Person.
</P>
<P>
   There were no points scored in the final 2:13 of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 20 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Danny
Ferry stuffed Malik Sealy, who appeared to get fouled by three
players on his way to the basket. But no call was made and Sura got
the rebound for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Miller drove to the basket but was stuffed by
Wally Szczerbiak, sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp picked up his sixth foul on Garnett's basket with 2:13 left
in regulation, and Garnett's free throw tied it at 99, erasing the
final remnants of the Cavs' 12-point third-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was bouncing Cleveland's way most of the night. In the
third quarter, Sealy fell down and inadvertently kicked the ball
into the hands of Person, who swished a 3 for a 74-63 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kemp was bothered by an injured finger on his right hand
since the first quarter, massaging it after every shot. . ...
Wolves coach Flip Saunders said Mitchell called him Monday night
and told him not to worry about getting him minutes because
Szczerbiak is playing so well. Mitchell missed 14 games with a
sprained ankle before playing five minutes Sunday night against
Milwaukee. ... The Cavs are 9-26 against winning teams and 7-26 on
the road.

   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Lonniya Bragg scored 18 points and
Arkansas overpowered Georgia Tech in the second half for a 78-67
victory Tuesday to advance to the semifinals of the Women's
National Invitational Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas (17-14) led 35-34 at the half and Tech kept it close
for most of the second half, leading 59-58 with 6:41 to play.
Arkansas took the lead six seconds later when Brandi Whitehead made
both ends of a 1-and-1. After Tech's last lead, the Lady Razorbacks
outscored Georgia Tech 20-8.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg hit her last nine attempts from the field and was one of
five Lady Razorbacks in double figures. India Lewis scored 14, Dana
Cherry had 12, Whitehead finished with 11 and Celia Anderson had
10. The latter four did all their damage coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson played only six minutes, going 4-for-4 from the field
and making both of her free throw attempts. Bragg also pulled down
nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Barlin led Tech with 16 points and Milli Martinez
contributed 12.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, last year's WNIT champion, hosts Florida on Saturday
in a semifinal matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (17-14) opened the game with an 11-2 run, with Amy
Lingenfelder making a long jumper and a 3 for half of her 10
points. She was shut out in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas answered with a 12-point run, including three baskets
by Cherry, to take a 14-13 lead with 9:18 remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The lead went back and forth for the rest of the period and a
layup by Bragg gave Arkansas a one-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bragg and Cherry each scored 10 points in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Md. Hostages Safe, Suspect Shot  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Three hostages being held by a murder
suspect jumped to safety from a window in their home Tuesday night
and police stormed the apartment, shooting the hostage taker,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the hostages are safe. That is all the information I
right now,'' police spokeswoman Vickie Warehime said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Joseph Palczynski, who took the three hostage on
Friday, was shot by police and was receiving medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea of his status, I have no idea of his condition,
but yes, Mr. Palczynski was shot by police,'' Warehime said.
''There were no other shots fired other than by police.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Friday when Palczynski allegedly forced his
way into a home in a Baltimore suburb and took three people
hostage, including the mother of his former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski, 31, is accused of kidnapping his ex-girlfriend,
Tracy Whitehead, on March 7. Whitehead said Palczynski beat her
four days earlier when she moved out of their apartment and moved
in with a co-worker, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Palczynski abducted Whitehead at gunpoint while
fatally shooting George and Gloria Shenk, the couple who had
sheltered her. Outside the Shenk home, he allegedly shot and killed
David Meyers, 42, a neighbor who tried to help Whitehead during the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped the next day by running to a police officer
who happened to be at a motel where Palczynski took her.
</P>
<P>
   Also that day, police said, Jennifer McDonel was fatally shot
and a 2-year-old boy was wounded when they drove by as Palczynski
fired shots during an attempted carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski then led police on a manhunt for more than a week,
surfacing in this Baltimore suburb Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That day, police say, he broke into a home and stole guns, then
shot his way into the home of Whitehead's relatives and held them
hostage. The captives were Whitehead's mother, the mother's
boyfriend and their 12-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff had been wearing down the patience of residents in
the four-block area surrounding the home where Palczynski was holed
up. Police cordoned off the area but allowed some residents to
leave Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose scored 28 points and Indiana
overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the New
York Knicks 95-91 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits had 20 for Indiana, including a short jumper over
Patrick Ewing that put the Pacers ahead to stay 93-91 with 57.4
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing led New York with 23 points and was 10-of-18 from the
field. However, Ewing missed his last four shots -- two of them
coming after Smits put Indiana ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's final miss came with 6.9 seconds left and Rose grabbed
the rebound. He was quickly fouled and hit both free throws with
4.1 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made Indiana, which has the league's best home
record (31-3), the first team in the Eastern Conference to clinch a
playoff spot. It also game the Pacers a 4{-game advantage over
Miami in the battle for home court advantage throughout the
conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws played a big role in the outcome. Indiana, the
league-leader in free throw accuracy, made 24 of 28 attempts. The
Knicks got to the line 10 times and made eight.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller had 17 for Indiana, including a 3-pointer that
ignited Indiana's comeback with 5:52 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers won despite shooting just 4-of-12 from the field in
the fourth quarter. New York, which shot 33-of-61 in the first
three periods, was 7-of-26 attempts in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New York took its biggest lead of the game at 81-71 as Kurt
Thomas and Marcus Camby scored the first two baskets of the fourth
quarter. Starting with Miller's 3-pointer, Indiana used free throws
to tie the game at 87 with a 16-6 run. The Pacers scored 10
consecutive points on free throws during the run, which ended on a
3-pointer by Austin Croshere.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's fadeaway jumper gave New York its final lead at 89-87
and a basket by Latrell Sprewell made it 91-87 with 2:37 to play.
Two free throws by Smits and a jumper by Croshere tied the game
with 1:49 left, setting the stage for the go-ahead bucket as each
team exchanged turnovers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indiana's sellout streak at Conseco Fieldhouse is 34 games.
... Derrick McKey missed his third consecutive game with a strained
muscle in his right leg. Dale Davis rejoined the Pacers after
missing four games with a strained hamstring although he did not
start. He was limited to only 15 minutes after taking an elbow to
his eye that needed four stitches. ... Indiana had seven blocks,
with Smits getting three. ... Larry Johnson struggled from the
field, shooting just 3-of-16. ... Rose has been in double figures
35 consecutive games, scoring at least 20 in 17 of his last 23.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Car Wash Shooting  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Police on Tuesday arrested a fired car wash
employee suspected of murdering five former co-workers and
critically wounding a sixth during a holdup at the business.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayne Harris, 28, was arrested without incident at a home
in Dallas, police said. He was arraigned Tuesday afternoon on a
charge of capital murder and was being held in the Irving jail
without bond.
</P>
<P>
   All six victims in the shooting Monday morning were employees of
the Mi-T-Fine Car Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had been fired from the car wash on Friday after he was
arrested on charges he exposed himself to two women at the
business. He was freed Sunday on $500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Police said robbery was a motive; all of the victims' wallets
were missing. Police spokesman David Tull would not say whether any
stolen items were found when Harris was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Dennis Lee, 48; Rhoda Wheeler, 45; Augustin
Villasenor, 36; Villasenor's brother, Benjamin, 32; and Roberto
Jimenez Jr., 17. Octavio Ramos, 36, was in critical condition
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Police told The Dallas Morning News that Harris is also a
suspect in the disappearance of a woman who was last seen near the
car wash Nov. 29. Her vehicle was found Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tull said detectives interviewed Harris after the woman
disappeared, but ''there was not any information that would lead us
to take any action against him.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Resume Drive for State  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians reopened Middle
East talks Tuesday at a screened-off U.S. Air Force base, and a
senior Israeli official said they could begin drafting the outline
of an accord by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little expectation of quick agreement to settle
their decades-long dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the negotiators began grappling with Palestinian demands
for a state and for a capital in Jerusalem, Israel withdrew from
another 6.1 percent of the West Bank. It gave Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat a larger foundation for a state and some land close
to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, ''We expect this
process to take a substantial amount of time to overcome
differences on these profound issues. And therefore, we do not
expect there to be early breakthroughs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians entered the talks at Bolling Air Force Base in
southeast Washington hopeful not only to make headway on terms of a
final settlement but to ensure that an expected Israeli West Bank
pullback in June is a generous one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hopeful that the Israeli side will be serious and
committed to the requirements of achieving a comprehensive and
lasting peace,'' Hassan Abdel Rahman, the chief PLO representative
in Washington, told The Associated Press as the delegations
assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope for a good week,'' Rahman said. ''We shall try.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the Palestinians' desires for a state with part of
Jerusalem as its capital, the Israeli Cabinet signaled Sunday it
was in a conciliatory mood by approving the surrender of another
6.1 percent of the West Bank, with two key provisions.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a Jewish settlement effectively will be
subject to Palestinian security for access by its residents; and
the Palestinians will get control of land on Jerusalem's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the talks are part of a step-by-step process of coming to terms
with the Palestinians. The official said one aim this week was to
find, with help from U.S. mediators, ''bridging proposals'' on
tough problems so that the two sides could begin drafting a
potential accord at the conclusion of the week-long talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also is pursuing reopened negotiations with Syria, which
were broken off in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is due to meet Sunday in Geneva, Switzerland,
with Syrian President Hafez Assad. Their first meeting in six years
is likely to result in resumption of negotiations, but that would
not mean the two sides are ready to strike a deal, the Israeli
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Washington Post, however, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak said that Syria and Israel have come close
to a peace agreement through indirect talks that have continued
unannounced since U.S.-brokered negotiations broke down in January.
The Egyptian said remaining issues ''will not be so complicated.''
The Post published the interview from Cairo on its Web site Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Europe from South Asia, Clinton also plans to meet
with Sultan Qaboos of Oman when Air Force One stops in that Persian
Gulf country to refuel. Israel has a handful of diplomats in Muscat
operating a trade office, and Qaboos has had a significant
behind-the-scenes role in Middle East peace diplomacy for years.
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington Air Force base, the Clinton administration is
cast in the role of attentive host. Veteran American mediators
Dennis Ross and Aaron Miller are alternating between the Israeli
and Palestinian delegations, with about a week of negotiations in
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat would like Israel to consent to statehood, and Clinton
has publicly backed ''Palestinian aspirations.'' Like most other
governments, his administration has declined to recognize Jerusalem
as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has vowed to declare a state if Israel doesn't yield in
the months ahead. If he does, Israel is considering a unilateral
move of its own: recognizing a state in part of the West Bank,
annexing clusters of Jewish settlements there and declaring it is
willing to negotiate the future of the rest of the territory, about
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The talks opened Tuesday with lunch at the Bolling officers'
club, with American mediators on hand. The first face-to-face
Israeli-Palestinian discussions were scheduled for Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The promised Israeli withdrawal on the West Bank in June will be
a major topic of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has conceded 41 percent of the West Bank and all of Gaza.
In the June redeployment, Prime Minister Ehud Barak is likely to
increase the amount of land that his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu, was prepared to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The goal set by Clinton, Arafat and Barak is a final accord by
mid-September that would settle Palestinian statehood demands and
the future of Jerusalem, which Israel reunited in 1967 by expelling
Jordanian troops from the eastern section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is eyeing the eastern sector as a Palestinian capital.

Fugitive rapist caught in Clinton Township

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After 12 days on the run, a fugitive rapist
who had eluded authorities nationwide since being released from a
southern New Jersey prison was captured Tuesday night by
authorities who tracked him as he boarded a train.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Alves was arrested at 7:40 p.m. at the Annandale train
station in Clinton Township by members of the Clinton Police
Department and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested without incident shortly after he got off a
train from Newark, said Bergen County Prosecutor William Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're absolutely thrilled,'' Schmidt said. ''There was a lot
of hard work put in by a lot of people in a lot of agencies. We've
been working around the clock on this. In the end, it came down to
old-fashioned police work. If you work hard, you make your own
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite legal safeguards, Alves, who claimed to have raped and
killed more than a dozen women, was allowed to walk out of prison
March 9.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune has
acknowledged that state corrections employees violated numerous
procedures before releasing the 57-year-old from the Southern State
Correctional Center in Cumberland County.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those violations, prosecutors weren't aware that
Alves was being released and never got a chance to seek to have him
civilly committed as a sexually violent predator.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said authorities ''received information he would be
taking this particular route,'' but stopped short of saying the tip
had come from an informant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tracked him to that train,'' Schmidt said. ''He was seen
after he left the train making a telephone call, and that's when he
was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Corrections spokesman Chris Carden said
officials from his department have already filed paperwork with the
state Attorney General's Office seeking to have Alves committed to
a residential treatment facility against his will. Under the law,
an inmate who has been released after serving a criminal sentence
can still be incarcerated if a judge determines he or she is a
continued danger to society, Carden said.
</P>
<P>
   Alves was charged by federal authorities with unlawful flight to
avoid prosecution, and by Bergen County authorities with failure to
register as a convicted sex offender under Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was released Alves gave authorities a fake
Massachusetts address where he said he would be living.
</P>
<P>
   He was processed Tuesday night at the Clinton Township police
department, and transferred to the Bergen County Jail in
Hackensack, where he was to spend the night, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman hailed the arrest, calling it ''a credit
to the tireless efforts of New Jersey and federal law enforcement
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our law is crystal clear: all Megan's Law offenders are
required to register with local authorities after their release
from prison even if their sentences are completed,'' she said.
''Alves failed to comply with our laws, and his quick apprehension
is a reflection of how seriously we view these requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Two psychologists hired by the state to review inmate records
were dismissed last week because of their roles in Alves' release.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections and the state Attorney General's
office are investigating why Alves was released before law
enforcement authorities were notified.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune said letters sent by the Bergen County prosecutor's
office to the state Parole Board offering evidence that Alves is a
suspect in several murders and claims that he raped and killed more
than a dozen women might not even have been considered by
corrections officials before his release.
</P>
<P>
   Alves served less than half of a 47-year sentence for the 1976
rape of a teen in Fair Lawn and the assault of a Clifton teen.

<HEADLINE> California 60, Georgetown 49  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Sean Lampley seems to save his biggest
games for the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Lampley, the MVP of last year's tournament, scored 15 of his 21
points in the second half as defending champion California (18-14)
defeated Georgetown 60-49 Tuesday night in the NIT's second round.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown (19-15) shot just 28 percent and committed 16
turnovers, and never seemed to play under control against the
Golden Bears. Anthony Perry had 12 points and Lee Scruggs had 11 to
lead the Hoyas, who had a triple-overtime victory over Virginia in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Lampley, whose 20 points led Cal to a 70-66 victory over Long
Beach State in the tournament's first round, struggled at times
this season despite leading the Bears in scoring and rebounding.
His inconsistent play earned him a spot on the bench at the start
of Cal's first game this season against archrival Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, seeking to become the NIT's first repeat champion
since St. John's in 1943-44, will face Wake Forest in the third
round. The Demon Deacons (19-14) won 72-65 over New Mexico on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Boumtje Boumtje, the Hoyas' leading rebounder and No. 2
scorer this season, returned after missing the Virginia game with a
sprained left ankle but was held to three points.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown's Kevin Braswell, who had a career-high 40 points
against Virginia, went 1-for-12 from the field and also scored
three points against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Cal led 28-26 at halftime, and both teams continued to struggle
offensively in the first few minutes of the second half. Georgetown
scored only two points in the opening 7:50 of the half, and Cal's
first basket of the half came with 5:09 gone. The Bears led 32-28
with six minutes gone in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Cal led 36-28 with 12:10 remaining when the Hoyas scored five
straight points. Georgetown pulled within 41-40 with 8:06 remaining
on a basket by Gharun Hester, but Lampley then converted an
alley-oop and added a dunk as Cal went on a 6-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   Lampley had five more points as the Bears extended that run to
13-5. Lampley's three-point play with 2:52 remaining gave Cal a
54-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown made just four of its first 19 shots, and went
9-for-30 from the field in the first half. But the Hoyas stayed in
the game by outrebounding Cal 20-13 in the half, and trailed by
just two points at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs had nine points in the first half and Perry added seven
for Georgetown. Lampley and Ryan Forehan-Kelly had six points each
in the first half for the Bears, who did not have a basket in the
game's opening 3:26.

<HEADLINE> Penguins 8, Islanders 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP)-- Tyler Wright and Jaromir Jagr each scored
twice and the Pittsburgh Penguins broke open a close game with four
goals in a 2:07 span Tuesday night in an 8-2 drubbing of the New
York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Wright added two assists, while Jagr had one. Other Penguins
goals were scored by Rene Corbet, Stephen Leach, Jiri Slegr and
Josef Beranek.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Pittsburgh has 76 points, three more than
Montreal and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Sebastien Aubin picked up his 21st win by stopping 28 shots
as Pittsburgh won consecutive games for the first time since Feb.
9.
</P>
<P>
   Olli Jokinen and Tim Connolly, on a shorthanded penalty shot,
scored for the Islanders, who have lost four of its last five.
Kevin Weekes started in goal and stopped 16 shots. He was replaced
by rookie Stephen Valiquette, who turned aside 14 more shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took a 2-0 lead in the first period on a power-play
goal by Corbet and a one-timer by Wright off one of three assists
by Pat Falloon.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen scored 51 seconds into the second period on a flip shot,
but then the Penguins turned up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Leach scored just his second goal of the season at 10:04 off a
2-on-1 break. Slegr scored on a one-timer 69 seconds later. Jagr's
one-timer beat Weekes 31 seconds after that, and Wright stuffed a
puck past Weekes 27 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Valiquette replaced Weekes at that point and surrendered goals
25 seconds apart as Jagr flipped a puck past him at 17:46 and
Beranek beat him with a long shot at 18:11.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders forward Josh Green during the third period with a
shoulder injury. Jagr left the ice with 7:35 left for unspecified
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly was awarded a penalty shot with 4:09 to go and beat
Aubin by faking a backhander and moving to the forehand and tucking
it in.

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth Visits Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The seats were empty and steady drizzle
fell Tuesday when Queen Elizabeth II visited the 110,000-capacity
stadium that will be the site of the opening ceremony for the 2000
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the arena will be packed with people. But the
queen won't be on hand, even though she is Australia's head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   In a break with tradition, Australia bypassed its head of state
as the dignitary who would officially open the Games. And the
government leader, Prime Minister John Howard, withdrew after being
accused of hypocrisy because he is a monarchist. Instead, the honor
will go to the queen's representative in Australia -- Gov.-Gen. Sir
William Deane.
</P>
<P>
   The British monarch's 13th visit to Australia is the first since
the country's citizens voted in November to retain her as the head
of state. Polls show most Australians want a homegrown head of
state, but can't agree on how to pick one.
</P>
<P>
   Royal aides said the queen was unfazed at not being invited to
the Games, and has not mentioned the controversy publicly since
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   In her only major speech Monday, she recognized Australia's
shift away from the monarchy, and said the Olympics would ''present
a great challenge and opportunity -- to show modern Australia to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a red and white dress and white hat, the queen
visited the Games' basketball and swimming venues Tuesday, as well
as the athletes' village and the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   She met current and former Australian Olympic athletes,
including retired gold medal swimmer Dawn Fraser, who said she
would have liked the queen to open the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have meant a lot to the athletes,'' said Fraser. ''I
think Australia should grow up and be an independent country. But
I'm a big fan of (the queen), and I will always admire the royal
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Security was stepped up for the queen's public appearances,
which included a visit to the Sydney Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the queen visited Australia's Outback, focusing
her two-hour visit to the remote town of Bourke on the Aboriginal
population.
</P>
<P>
   At an Aboriginal radio station which broadcasts in indigenous
languages she was welcomed by the Ngemba Muranari Aboriginal dance
troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station manager Greg McKellar said the queen showed a key
interest in Aboriginal culture during her 15 minute visit.
</P>
<P>
   Attending separate functions in Wagga Wagga, 250 miles southwest
of Sydney, the queen's husband, Prince Philip, on Tuesday caused a
stir at a cheesemaking facility when he declined to put on a
laboratory coat and hair net because, aides said, he was only going
to be inside for four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesemaker Barry Lillywhite said the $1,000 batch under
production during the Duke of Edinburgh's visit would have to be
tested for contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll probably end up throwing out today's product,''
Lillywhite said, adding that a police sniffer dog and television
crew also had been through the facility. ''You can't take the risk
of contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday adjourned proceedings against a
man arrested Monday with an 8-inch kitchen knife strapped to his
leg outside a venue where the queen was to have lunch. The man was
sent into psychiatric care indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Philip Pailthorpe, 39, faced charges of illegal
possession of a knife in public and possession of marijuana. Lawyer
Simon Bleasel said Pailthorpe believed himself a member of the
Special Air Service assigned to protect the queen.

Md. Hostages Safe, Suspect Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Three hostages held by a murder suspect jumped to safety
from a window in their home tonight and police stormed the apartment, fatally
shooting the man who had held them captive since Friday. The standoff began
Friday when the suspect, Joseph Palczynski allegedly forced his way into a home
in a Baltimore suburb and took three people hostage, including the mother of his
former girlfriend. Palczynski was accused of kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, Tracy
Whitehead, on March 7, killing four people over a two-day period and leading
police on a manhunt for more than a week.

   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton won India's pledge Tuesday to
pursue peaceful means of resolving tensions with Pakistan in the face of new
bloodshed in Kashmir. ''There is no threat of war,'' said Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee. But India rejected Clinton's call to slow its nuclear weapons
program. The president was pressing his case for stronger U.S. ties with India
in an address before a joint session of Parliament.

   HONG KONG (AP) -- An intense undersea earthquake with an estimated magnitude
of 6.2 has been recorded in the Maluku archipelago in eastern Indonesia, the
Hong Kong Observatory said Wednesday. There were no immediate reports of damage
or casualties. The temblor recorded Tuesday afternoon was centered north of
Halmahera island in the Pacific Ocean, the observatory said. There were no
reports of tsunami, destructive tidal waves caused by earthquakes. An earthquake
with a magnitude above 6.0 can cause severe damage when centered on land under

Russia Mulls Nuclear Treaty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Top security officials and members of parliament discussed the
START II nuclear arms reduction treaty at a closed-door meeting Tuesday, and
issued a statement encouraging the full parliament to ratify the document. START
II, signed in 1993, limits the United States and Russia to about 3,000 nuclear

Duma, waiting ratification. Hard-line deputies argue the country needs a stiff
nuclear shield to compensate for shabby conventional forces. But military and
foreign policy leaders have said they support the treaty, in part because Russia
cannot afford to maintain a large nuclear arsenal.

Gore Attacks Republicans on Census
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Gore today challenged George W. Bush's concern for
minorities, saying they are shortchanged by a census that congressional
Republicans refuse to modernize in order to get a more accurate count. Democrats
like Gore have long supported changing the census to incorporate sampling, a way
of statistically adjusting actual headcounts to account for populations with
traditionally low response rates, such as minority groups in cities. Republican
lawmakers have fought sampling, which could lower headcounts in GOP-heavy areas.

Pope Starts Tour of Israel

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Pope John Paul II on Tuesday began the first official visit
by a Roman Catholic pontiff to Israel, fulfilling his dream of visiting the Holy
Land where Christ was born and died. The pilgrimage caps the ailing 79-year-old
pope's efforts to reconcile Catholics and Jews. Mainstream Jewish leaders
welcome the pope's visit, but they would like him to go further in acknowledging
the church's past discrimination against Jews and its public silence during the
Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> NW Airlines Loses Communication  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines lost most of its
communications lines systemwide for about 2{ hours Tuesday when a
telecommunications company hit a fiber-optic cable, leading to
cancellations and delays around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers aboard planes were not in danger, but Northwest
temporarily suspended boarding additional flights until the problem
was fixed, said spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 of the airline's 1,700 daily flights were canceled
systemwide, and an undetermined number were delayed. Schubert said
communications lines went down just after 2 p.m. CST, affecting
reservations and baggage information and the airline's electronic
ticketing system.
</P>
<P>
   Major delays were reported in Detroit, where about 30 flights
were canceled, according to Northwest spokesman Doug Killian.
</P>
<P>
   Another 19 were canceled in Minneapolis, with the remainder
scattered around the system. Some delays also were experienced in
Singapore and Bangkok, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's Web site also was out of service because of the
severed cable.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Bothun, a spokesman for U S West, the telecom that owns the
fiber-optic cable, said the line was cut by a competitor McLeod
USA, a local and long-distance telecommunications company based in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa. She said it is not uncommon for
telecommunications companies' cables to be very close to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod USA spokesman Bruce Tiemann said a subcontractor, whose
name he did not know, was responsible. He said crews were
installing fiber-optic cables at the time, and the area in which
they were digging had not been marked as an area containing other
cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest officials said the airline expected to be back to
normal operations by Wednesday morning.

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Naomi Mobley scored 13 points and
grabbed 12 rebounds Tuesday night as Florida beat Maryland 77-57 in
the Women's National Invitational Tournament quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Gators (20-12) used a 10-0 run with about five minutes
left in the game to pull away to a 22-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Florida will play Arkansas at Fayetteville, Ark., on Saturday in
the semifinals. The Lady Razorbacks defeated Georgia Tech 78-67
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Gators outrebounded the Terrapins 47-35 and held
Maryland (16-15) to 30.8 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, a sophomore, notched her 10th double-double of the
season. Junior Tamara Stocks added 12 points to become the 15th
player in Lady Gators history to score 1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that three Gators scored their 1,000th
point in the same season. Stocks joined teammates Tiffany Travis,
who contributed 17 points on the night, and Tonya Washington, who
added 16 points and nine rebounds, to accomplish this feat.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland was led by Marche Strickland with 27 points and Rosita
Melbourne with 10 points and 11 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Spot known for women's rights maintains tradition of only malemayors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- Home to the first known women's rights
convention and to the National Women's Hall of Fame, this Finger
Lakes village has never had a female mayor.
</P>
<P>
   That did not change with Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gail Lafler, only the second woman to run for the
part-time post in recent memory, lost 989-784 to Republican Antonio
Costantino.
</P>
<P>
   Costantino, who carries an Italian accent from his youth in
Fondi, outside Rome, said he thinks women's rights are
''beautiful'' but he was nonetheless ''really thrilled for the
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafler, 53, blamed the loss on an entrenched ''good old boys'
network.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her supporters were stunned with the results because
her academic qualifications outshined Costantino's.
</P>
<P>
   She is an administrator for Clyde-Savannah Central School
District who is working on a doctoral degree.
</P>
<P>
   Costantino, a 53-year-old barber, last attended school in Italy
40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his home Tuesday night, he said he regretted never
pursuing an education in the United States and admitted not being
able to write very well.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want someone with common sense,'' he said. ''I know
right from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame was established in 1969 in Seneca Falls, where
the first known women's rights convention was held in 1848. Women
eventually won the right to vote in 1920.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 96, Nuggets 83  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored nine of his 28 points
in a 19-3 game-ending run as the Utah Jazz defeated Denver 96-83
Tuesday night for their 11th win in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel hit a 20-foot jumper to put Denver up 80-77 midway
through the fourth quarter before the Nuggets went cold. Malone hit
a baseline jumper and a three-point play in a 9-0 run that gave the
Jazz an 86-80 lead with 2:56 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess hit a free throw before Jeff Hornacek hit a
3-pointer and then fed Bryon Russell for an emphatic fast-break
dunk to make it 91-81 with 1:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Malone hit 10 of 11 free throws and grabbed 10 rebounds, Russell
had 16 points and Hornacek and Howard Eisley added 12 points each
for the Jazz, who shot 72 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess led Denver with 25 points and 12 rebounds while Keon
Clark scored 19 points. Van Exel had 13 assists but scored just 8
points on 2 of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the teams' last meeting at the Delta Center in
January, the Jazz finished with a huge fourth quarter to post their
eighth straight home win. In that game Denver coach Dan Issel
shouted at his Utah counterpart Jerry Sloan for running up the
score even though the teams were even midway through the last
period.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sloan made a point to clear his bench with 34 seconds
to play as the Nuggets lost their 11th game of the last 13.
</P>
<P>
   James Posey brought the Nuggets out of halftime with a bang as
the rookie guard hit a pair of 3-pointers. McDyess added a follow
hoop and suddenly Denver had a 54-49 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets stayed in front for the rest of the third quarter as
McDyess used his quickness to score over and around the Jazz
centers. The 6-foot-9 leaper had 12 points in the quarter on 6-of-7
shooting and Denver led 72-67 going into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, who led the entire first half, jumped out to a 17-5
lead as Malone scored 10 and John Stockton handed out six assists
in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Denver battled back behind the inside scoring of Clark, who
had 12 in the half, to cut the lead to 49-47 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Nuggets starting guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad missed his second
game with a sprained wrist. ... Karl Malone, who has been a
spokesman for Rogaine, shaved his head before the game. ... Denver
last won in Salt Lake City in 1995, a span of eight games.

<HEADLINE> Missouri prepares for first execution of 2000  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. (AP) -- James Henry Hampton, a two-time killer who
has spent most of his life in prison, was scheduled to die by
injection early Wednesday at the Potosi Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, 62, would be the first Missouri inmate put to death
this year and the 42nd since the death penalty was reinstated in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton has maintained since his conviction four years ago that
he wanted to be executed rather than grow old in prison. He refused
to make court appeals and did not seek clemency from Gov. Mel
Carnahan. However, a group of death penalty opponents, led by the
Missouri Catholic Conference, sought clemency for him. Carnahan
denied their request about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor saw no reason to commute the sentence,''
spokesman Jerry Nachtigal said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections department spokesman Tim Kniest said Hampton chose a
dozen glazed doughnuts and two pints of milk for his last meal.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton admitted beating Frances Keaton to death with a hammer
in 1992 after abducting her from her home in Warrenton. He then
fled to New Jersey, where he killed another woman during another
failed kidnapping attempt.
</P>
<P>
   As police moved in on Hampton in New Jersey, he stuck a gun
beneath his chin and shot himself. The bullet exited through the
front of Hampton's brain. At his trial in 1996, neurologist
Jonathan Pincus of Georgetown University testified that the brain
wound affected Hampton's judgment. Death penalty opponents blamed
impaired judgment for Hampton's desire to die.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it morally irresponsible for the state to execute someone
when there is reasonable doubt that he can make good judgments,''
said Rita Linhardt of the Missouri Catholic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton refused interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton grew up one of 11 children in a poor family in the
Louisville, Ky., area. He went to reform school at age 11 and spent
his adult life in and out of prisons. Before his murder sentences,
he served time in 25 different prisons for crimes ranging from
burglary to assault to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   During one stint in the federal prison in Marion, Ill., in the
early 1970s, he befriended Gary Gilmore. Gilmore in 1976 would
become the first American to be executed after a decade-long ban on
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Linhardt said the meeting had a strong effect on Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like he's almost wanting to be like Gilmore,'' Linhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Court records showed that Hampton parked his car at the parking
lot of a Warrenton church on Aug. 2, 1992, then drove a bicycle the
three miles to Keaton's home. An acquaintance, a realtor who had
worked with Keaton, told Hampton that Keaton had $30,000 in the
bank. The realtor also gave Hampton a key to the home.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton entered with a sawed-off shotgun and demanded money from
Keaton, a 58-year-old hairdresser, and her fiance, Allen
Mulholland. He tied up Mulholland and abducted Keaton, taking her
car and heading west on Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   While driving, Hampton learned from a police scanner that law
enforcement authorities had been alerted to the kidnapping. Hampton
testified at his trial that he had decided in advance to kill his
hostage if police learned of the kidnapping before he received his
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton bound and blindfolded Keaton and took her to a wooded
area of Callaway County. Once there, he killed her with several
hammer blows to the head and then buried her body.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton drove back to Warrenton and attempted to retrieve his
car. When he saw that police were keeping it under surveillance, he
fled to New Jersey. On Sept. 16, 1992, he killed Christine
Schurman, 48, of Wantage Township. Her body was found by her
husband, Dr. Alan Schurman. She died of a single bullet wound to
the head, also after a failed kidnapping attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was finally captured on Dec. 19, 1992, one day after he
was featured on the television show ''America's Most Wanted.'' A
New Jersey pastor recognized Hampton from the television program
and alerted police.
