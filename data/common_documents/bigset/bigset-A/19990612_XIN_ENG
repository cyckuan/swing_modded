<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Witnesses Rapid Growth in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Since Uganda launched radical
economic reforms over one decade ago, its economy has fully
recovered from previous damages caused by civil strife and
political instability by recording a rare growth rate in Africa
and even in the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, Uganda's economy has grown by six
percent and when reading the 1999/2000 budget to Parliament
Thursday afternoon, Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula told the MPs
that the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to
grow by 7.8 percent in the current fiscal year ending this June.
</P>
<P>
Although the National Resistance Movement inherited in January
1986 an economy characterized by severe macro-economic
disequilibria, it launched the famous Economic Recovery Program in
1987 whose broad aspects were financial stabilization, structural
adjustment and economic transformation.
</P>
<P>
These reforms have yielded fruits. By the year 1998, a total
of 296 projects had been licensed with planned investment of 1.566
billion U.S. dollars, providing 18,765 jobs.
</P>
<P>
As a result of industrial development, the share of agriculture
in the GDP had declined from 57 percent in 1987 to 42.5 percent in
1997. Non- coffee export earnings had soared up from 31.9 million
dollars to 293.9 million dollars over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collections, the main source of government revenue,
increased from 110 million dollars in 1992 to about 700 million
dollars in 1997 while foreign exchange inflows consisting of
direct investment, private transfers and export earnings had shot
up to 1,151 million dollars from 174 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following the Civil Service Reform program, the number of civil
servants had been slashed from 320,000 in 1991 to 157,000 in 1997.
 Their salaries had increased from 2.7 percent of the GDP to 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the current financial year, Uganda's GDP is expected to grow
by 7.8 percent. This is more than twice as fast as the average for
all developing countries, which is estimated by the International
Monetary Fund at only 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ssendaula said this economic growth in the current fiscal year
was led by agriculture and manufacturing. Agricultural
production, the main-stay of economy, bounced back very strongly
after two consecutive years in which production was hit by the El
Nino weather pattern and a severe drought. Production of cash and
food crops rose by 14 percent and 10 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the manufacturing sector continued at a
vigorous pace, with output growth projected at 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, economic growth has not been confined to agriculture
and manufacturing. It has been broadly based, with most of the
major sectors of the economy achieving real growth rates exceeding
five percent in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector expanded output at a rate of eight
percent, the wholesale and retail trade at nine percent, the
transport and communications sector at seven percent, and
electricity and water at five percent.
</P>
<P>
Faced with new challenges like volatile exchange rate, bank
closures and increased insecurity, the Ugandan government has
decided to put most of its energy on economic construction as
indicated in the new budget.
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget, the government lists education,
improvement of infrastructure and poverty eradication as its the
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Budget for education has increased from 246 billion shillings
(170 million dollars) for the current fiscal year's to 340 billion
shillings (240 million dollars). Road building will be 105.59
billion shillings (80 million dollars), an increase of 50 percent.
 The poverty action fund will be up by 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
With improvement of infrastructure, increase of home-stead
incomes and reduction of illiteracy rate, Uganda's economy will
usher in a new era of unprecedented growth.

<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government decided
Friday to grant Zimbabwe 794 million Zimbabwean dollars (20
million U.S. dollars) in aid.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the grant was signed here by Zimbabwean Finance
 Minister Herbert Murerwa and Japanese Ambassador to Zimbabwe
Eiromu Nitta.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the Japanese grant was crucial in providing
support to critical areas under the Zimbabwean government's grand
plan, the Zimbabwe Program for Economic and Social Transformation.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure on foreign currency reserves caused by the high
demand on imports will be eased and this should ensure that there
is minimum disruption in the operations of our industries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A number of local companies were experiencing difficulties in
getting raw materials and other related inputs because of lack
foreign currency, he said.

<HEADLINE> First College for Private Nurses Inaugurated in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's first college for
private nurses, the Salam Nurses College, has been inaugurated in
capital Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newly established nurses college has three lecture rooms,
two fully equipped demonstration rooms, a laboratory, a library
and dormitories for 90 students.
</P>
<P>
The college offers diploma program in nursing for two and half
years and is currently training 58 nursing students who will be
deployed at the Salam General Hospital being constructed on the
premises of the college.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the college Thursday, Deputy Minister of Health
Lamissio Hayso said, in the past, the health sector was
centralized and entrepreneurs were not encouraged to involve in
the field.
</P>
<P>
The federal government, he added, has formulated a new policy
that promotes health services and the participation of the private
sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The college has been recognized by the Ministry of Health and
the Investment Authority and is awaiting accreditation from the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are seven state-owned nurses schools in
Ethiopia, said the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves Anti-Dumping Duties on Japanese Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An independent U.S. commission
on Friday found that Japanese dumping of hot-rolled steel in the
U.S. market threatened the U.S. steel industry and ordered hefty
anti-dumping duties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. International Trade Commission voted 6-0 in favor of a
complaint brought by U.S. steel makers and workers who accused
Japanese exporters of selling hot-rolled steel in the United
States at less than fair value.
</P>
<P>
The action clears the way for the Clinton administration to
impose tariffs on Japanese hot-rolled steel. The tariffs, which
will effectively make Japanese steel more expensive, will likely
be in place at least five years.
</P>
<P>
The duties, ranging from 17.86 percent to 67.14 percent of the
imports' value, will be retroactive to February 12 when the
Commerce Department found Japanese exporters guilty of dumping
hot-rolled steel.
</P>
<P>
The hot-rolled steel case was one of a number of steel
anti-dumping cases brought by the U.S. industry and labor unions
in response to a flood of cheap imports last year that they said
was hurting their bottom line and forcing job cuts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Customs Service will be ordered to begin collecting
duties of 19.65 percent on imports from Nippon Steel Corp., 17.86
percent on imports from NKK Corp., 67.14 percent on imports from
Kawasaki Steel Corp. and 29.3 percent on imports from all other
Japanese steel companies.

<HEADLINE> S. African Currency Ends Stronger Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African currency,
rand, changed its fortunes on Friday afternoon, gaining 3.70 cents
from its previous close against the U.S. dollar on the back of
local and London dollar selling.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since Monday, the rand ended its session
stronger against the dollar at 6.0880 per dollar from Thursday's
close of 6.1250.
</P>
<P>
Dealers have been hoping for the rand to end the day firmer in
the run-up to the new cabinet announcement early next week.
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki, the president-elect, is expected to name his new
cabinet at the opening of parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
London players started selling dollars just after 14:00 local
time (12: 00 GMT). This saw the local currency edge below the
6.1000 psychological level once again.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association reported that a local
mining company was also seen dumping dollars in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Although the company had quite a substantial amount of dollars,
it was not clear if that had a significant contribution on the
rand's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
The report said the local market was uncertain on what had
triggered London players' sudden interest on the rand.
</P>
<P>
The rand had been substantially stronger in the afternoon,
testing an intra-day best level of 6.0850 per dollar.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Send 2,500 More Soldiers to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Lower chamber of Germany's
parliament, the Bundestag, Friday passed with a clear majority the
bill from the cabinet to deploy 2,500 more soldiers in Kosovo as
part of the international peacekeeping force in the region(KFOR).
</P>
<P>
Some 505 German lawmakers voted for the bill, with 24 against
and 11 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Germany's military presence in Kosovo will be
raised to 8,500 from the present 6,000. The soldiers will be
deployed there for at least 3 years.
</P>
<P>
"The German Bundestag approves the deployment of armed German
forces to participate in a security presence in Kosovo to protect
the return of refugees and to secure a peace settlement for
Kosovo," said the parliament in its resolution.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said the country's foreign
political role had changed through its actions in the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
"We have no more excuses to avoid taking part in international
operations," he said on television.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said he expected a "high-risk
operation especially at the very beginning" for German soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers will have to cope with mined areas and possible
conflicts with the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army(KLA), he said
in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
He estimated German involvement in the KFOR would last several
years. "Three years seem to be too short, it will possibly last
longer," said Scharping.

LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected recovery in Japanese
economic growth and low level of U.S. inflation data gave a boost
to European stock markets Friday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's leading FTSE 100 index drew nearer to its record
closing high on the session, ending up 81.4, or nearly 1.3
percent, at 6484.4.
</P>
<P>
Leading the rise were the mining stocks as dealers hoped for
increased demand for commodities from Japan, the giant
manufacturing nation.

The FTSE 100 index, which set a record when it closed at 6598.8
on April 28, was up 1.9 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax closed up 94.52 points, or 1.82

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has urged local leaders in the central district of Mubende to
guide people on viable economic activities.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing a public rally in the
district Friday afternoon, a press release from the President's
Office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said he was happy to note that some farmers in the
district have started on projects which would help them out of
poverty, and added that the government is ready to provide
improved seeds and seedlings to boost their agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
The president also thanked local leaders for their support for
the ruling National Resistance Movement's efforts to consolidate
the liberation process by voting for the Movement.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders were requested to reorient the population to
engage in intensive farming because their land acreage is small.
</P>
<P>
Projects such as diary cows, clonal coffee, fruit and fish
farming were recommended as some of the activities aimed at
raising their home-stead incomes.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the president inspected development projects
of individual farmers, a zero-grazing project as well as a clonal
coffee project.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Discovers Biggest Mummy Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian archaeologists have
discovered a huge mummy cemetery in the Western Desert with 200
mummies of 3,000 years ago having been uncovered so far.
</P>
<P>
The cemetery, which dates back to the early Greco-Roman era, is
believed to contain more than 10,000 mummies, the biggest ever
uncovered, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The area, within the city of Bawiti, 300 kilometers southwest
of Cairo, has been renamed "Valley of the Mummies," the news
agency quoted Zahi Hawass, head of the 12-member discovery team,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cemetery is six kilometers long, Hawass told MENA, adding
that it took four years to uncover the first 200 mummies. Work
will continue until the rest are uncovered, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fifty mummies were found in each of four rooms. They included
wealthy people and some rulers, Gaballah Ali Gaballah, head of the
Supreme Council of Antiquities, told MENA.
</P>
<P>
Some of the mummies had golden masks, and others were covered
with plaster or resting in pottery coffins.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the mummies, a wine factory and several pieces
of pottery were also discovered, MENA reported.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Asks for Time to Resolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
pleaded Friday for time to enable his government to resolve the
underlying problems behind the crisis in the oil producing
community of Warri, where about 300 people have been killed during
two weeks of renewed ethnic clashes.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, on an assessment visit to the town in the oil rich
Niger delta region in southern Nigeria, expressed "sadness" over
the latest outbreak of violence among the Ijaws, Itsekiris and
Urhobos, the three main ethnic groups in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Neither your governor nor those of us in abuja were given time
to handle the matter before the latest outbreak," the president
said before a two-hour tour of the city accompanied by the Delta
State governor, Chief James Ibori.
</P>
<P>
The president, who did not make any announcement, repeated his
complaint that "the Niger delta had been ignored by previous
governments," while pledging to work with the state government to
resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Niger delta area produces all of the country's oil since
oil was discovered in the 1950s, providing above 90 percent of the
nation's foreign currency reserve.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, whose visit came two days after relative calm
returned to the city after an orgy of violence that left about
hundreds of houses torched and about 300,000 fleeing from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the audience, Governor Ibori pledged to give the
youths, who are behind the violence, a sense of belonging.
</P>
<P>
Ibori also pleaded for time "to enable wounds to heal and for
interaction to resume".
</P>
<P>
"Patronizing violence and unconventional means to address the
grievances is not a sign of strength," Ibori said as he appealed
for cooperation in resolving the crisis which broke out after the
relocation of a local government headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo later left for Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers
State which has also witnessed violent protests by youths
complaining about the neglects of the delta.
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to hold a meeting with all ethnic
group leaders in the region including the three major fighting
ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bush Faces First Test of Campaign Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Texas Governor George Bush
faces the first test of his campaign skills as he arrives in Iowa
to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His advisers say his visit to Iowa and New Hampshire, his first
trip of the campaign, will feature a defiant defense of his
"compassionate conservatism" philosophy.
</P>
<P>
He wants to pick a fight to make news, one aide said, but he
doesn't want to engage Vice President Al Gore this early. So he
will attack, by inference, Republican rivals Dan Quayle and Lamar
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
While the Presidential election is still more than a year away,
the race for the White House is well underway, with 11 Republicans
vying for party nominations.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential hopefuls, including former Vice
President Dan Quayle, former Tennessee Governor Alexander and
commentator Pat Buchanan, say the Republicans are foolishly
following polls and stampeding behind an untested candidate.
</P>
<P>
Polls repeatedly show that Republican Bush, son of former
President George Bush, clearly is the front-runner for the 2000
race, not just for the nomination of the Republican Party but also
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
As for fundraising, Bush also led the Republican candidates in
the first quarter of 1999, collecting 7.6 million dollars in just
26 days.
</P>
<P>
Bush prepared for the first trip with hours of briefings
coordinated by aides with input from policy and political experts
from around the country, but political observers are still waiting
to see whether he can live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges facing his campaign is to remake the image
of a divided Republican Party which has suffered unexpected losses
in last year's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
What Bush's candidacy will show is whether he has the ideas to
reshape and unite his party or will attempt to gloss over the
differences with a campaign long on personality and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
His aides said Bush's speech in Iowa will trace the broad
themes of his campaign without laying out specific policy
proposals.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire have a chance to
hear me speak from the heart and I know I'll listen to them," Bush
said. "I want to talk about why I'm running and show some
passion."
</P>
<P>
Patience and caution have characterized Bush's performance in
the past year. As Congress struggled with Kosovo war and
impeachment against President Bill Clinton and the Texas State
Legislature debated gun-control and hate-crimes bills, he stayed
offstage.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say Bush is playing smart politics. It's a
classic front-runner strategy, said Bruce Buchanan, a presidential
scholar at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever possible, be ambiguous, and don't alienate anyone
with your issue stands," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
on Friday urged a concerted international effort to rebuild Kosovo
and enable Kosovar refugees to return home before winter.
</P>
<P>
"No one should pass this winter in the (refugee) tents.
Everyone should be able to return to their homeland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said he hopes "everything will progress in order,"
adding it will not be an easy task to resettle the over 1 million
refugees and displaced persons in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear what has happened to the houses and properties
of these people. No one knows the conditions of their homes in
Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said the Turkish Red Crescent Society will assist the
return of the ethnic Albanian refugees, who fled the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia in late March.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17,541 Kosovar refugees are now taking shelter in
Turkey, a statement of the Turkish Interior Ministry revealed.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accuses Eritrea of Launching Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Friday accused
Eritrean troops of initiating an assault in the vicinity of the
Mereb River Thursday, saying that fighting continued on the
western front Friday.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by the office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse charged that "Eritrea also initiated
an offensive on the Burie front from June 9-10."
</P>
<P>
However, a press release issued by Eritrean Foreign Ministry in
Asmara Friday said that Ethiopia launched "a larger offensive"
along the central flank of the Mereb Setit front, close to the
disputed Badme region where the war first erupted early last May.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Director of the President Office, Yermane Gebremeskel,
also said Thursday that the Ethiopian forces Wednesday mounted
attacks on the southeastern Burie front, 70 km west from Eritrea's
Red Seaport of Assab,
</P>
<P>
The fresh military conflict followed over two weeks' lull on
the border areas between the two Horn of Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea announced that their army killed and
injured "hundreds of soldiers" of the other side during border
fighting in late May this year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) have repeatedly called on the two nations to
resolve their over one-year-old conflict peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out again and again although both countries
have accepted the OAU peace framework, because each maintains its
own interpretation of the wording of the OAU framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia says that Eritrea must withdraw from all "occupied
territory" while Eritrea insists that the withdrawal of troops
only applies to the Badme region.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia took back the Badme region during its Operation Sunset
launched late February this year.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Govt Pledges to Hold Election in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao reaffirmed here Friday that his government is
committed to holding the second multi-party general election
within 1999.
</P>
<P>
Simao revealed this at a press conference in Maputo on behalf
of Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
The second election was scheduled for October this year. But
some opposition parties have suggested postponing it until next
year on the ground that the period from voters' registration to
voting date is too short and the rainy season in November and
December will bring traffic inconvenience to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"The country can't stop advancing just because of the rains,"
Simao said in response.
</P>
<P>
The minister also dismissed the claim that rains will prevent
farmers from going to vote, saying that the Mozambican government
has given priority to the rehabilitation and building of roads.
</P>
<P>
Simao noted that the existing political agenda should be
followed and "we can't deceive those who have provided us with
financial support," referring to the international community, and
the European Union donors in particular.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that his government does not fear a
boycott by the opposition parties just like the one in the local
elections last June.
</P>
<P>
Most opposition parties led by the biggest Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo) didn't take part in the elections held last
June in 33 towns and cities in this southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Mozambican National Electoral
Commission, Jamisse Taimo lately ruled out the possibility of
holding the general election in October, but noting that it may be
put off until December this year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique held its first multi-party general election in
October 1994.

<HEADLINE> Angola Admits Meeting with Zambia in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda admitted here Friday that his government had held a
meeting with Zambia in Swaziland Tuesday on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Miranda confirmed this before his departure for Portugal. A
report by Zambia Daily Mail also said earlier that representatives
from the two countries signed an agreement of understanding after
their meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, the Swazi meeting was to
implement a memorandum for understanding reached between the two
countries in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa in March. But he
denied any agreement had been signed after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government also invited delegations from
Mozambique, South Africa and Namibia to attend the Tuesday
meeting, which was expected by Angola to press Zambia to take firm
action to stop completely its direct or indirect support for the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
said Miranda.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Zambia must admit that it did have provided
assistance to UNITA," instead of making public denial as it had
been. The Angolan side did not expect any sort of agreement
before the meeting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two southern African countries had been
tense due to Angola's repeated accusation that Zambia has provided
military support to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation by the Organization of African Unity and
South African President Nelson Mandela, the two governments
decided to hold meetings on different levels in Swaziland, that
is, bilateral experts' meeting at the beginning, to be followed by
meetings of defense and foreign ministers, and lastly a summit.

<HEADLINE> Land Reform Policy Urged In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai said Friday there is need to debate and
construct a meaningful policy framework for land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Kangai made the remarks when opening a one-day seminar for
governors, chiefs and parliamentarians here in the capital on the
drafting of national land policy.
</P>
<P>
The land question had remained a central political, economic
and social issue for the country, he said, adding that "a national
land policy with clear guiding principles would provide a
framework and rationale for specific land initiatives and
programs."
</P>
<P>
A good land policy would lead to increased agricultural
production and growth of the manufacturing and services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he suggested that the land policy be guided by basic
 principles of equity, efficiency, legitimacy and accountability.
</P>
<P>
"These are the objectives and principles that we believe should
underpin our national land policy to drive economic growth and
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Zimbabwean government had set up
 committees in provinces to ensure that those who deserved were
resettled.

<HEADLINE> Public Service Threatens Mass Action Over Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's labor unions
which represent about 1.2 million public servants threatened
Friday to embark on industrial action after three months of wage
talks with the State locked.
</P>
<P>
Unions affiliated to the Congress of South African Trade Unions
-- the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union, the
South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) and the Police and
Prisons Civil Rights Union -- met Friday night to discuss future
actions.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, SADTU general secretary Thulas Nxesi said
the unions had voted to take the matter to their members who would
decide whether to embark on mass action.
</P>
<P>
Union negotiators were quoted by South African Press
Association (SAPA) as saying that the State had refused to better
its offer of a five-percent pay increase since talks started in
February, despite attempts to mediate through the Commission for
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The State argued that it only had three billion rand (4.8
billion U.S. dollars) available for pay rises.
</P>
<P>
The unions said, however, that the State does have money, and
that it is attempting to stall the process.
</P>
<P>
On April 29, all public service unions, with the exception of
the South African Police Union and the Domestic Nursing
Organization of South Africa, declared a dispute with the
employer.
</P>
<P>
Nxesi said the unions had no other option as the State had
refused to budge on its initial offer of 5.7 percent, despite an
agreement by the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining council
-- representing the unions - - to drop its demand from 15 percent
to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer negotiate with the state, we have moved out
of the bargaining chamber," he said.
</P>
<P>
The unions are demanding salary increases above inflation rate
and a moratorium on retrenchments.
</P>
<P>
They are also calling for the closure of the apartheid wage gap
between the lowest and highest paid workers in public service, and
a comprehensive remuneration system without down-grading the
existing conditions of service.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Adopt Disease-Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen southern African and Indian
Ocean island countries adopted here Friday a health cooperation
framework for joint disease prevention in the sub-region, a World
Health Organization (WHO) official said.
</P>
<P>
WHO information officer Samuel Ajibola said the framework of
cooperation is aimed at reducing mortality caused by a wide range
of diseases in the countries.
</P>
<P>
The diseases targeted for prevention and control included
cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, polio and rabies.
</P>
<P>
"The framework also aims at ensuring coordination of efforts
and resources within the context of an inter-country plan for
disease prevention and control," Ajibola said.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries are Angola, Botswana, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the Comoros,
Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
Ajibola said the document urged the countries to show political
will and commitment to put right the diseases.
</P>
<P>
The document lists specific areas of intervention in the
countries as including integrated communicable diseases
surveillance, strengthening of public health services and
improvement of inter-country communication systems.
</P>
<P>
WHO regional director Ebrahim Samba said the agency would
continue to assist the countries to right the diseases.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate our pledge to continue assistance to countries in
this critical area. A WHO consultant is already visiting countries
in the region to identify possible areas of intervention," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Friday that Athens wanted to participate in
the command of the multinational peacekeeping force, which is to
be deployed in Kosovo in accordance with the peace agreement
signed by NATO and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos made the remarks when he was inspecting the
mechanized battalion of the 34th brigade that will be sent to
Kosovo, the Thessaloniki-based Macedonian Press Agency (MPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that this had not been decided yet as the relevant
negotiations continued.
</P>
<P>
The war in Yugoslavia had ended but the peace agreement should
be supported and implemented, he said, adding that there should be
peace in the Balkans and the procedure for their economic
restructuring should be underway.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for a new system of security since there
would be multinational military forces in the Balkan region for
many years.
</P>
<P>
The Greek brigade will eventually number 1,200 men. In the
first phase, 480 will leave for Kosovo and will be followed by
another 300 after a few days. The Battalion is made up of 450
officers, personnel carriers and other military vehicles and it
will be stationed at the southeastern part of Kosovo between the
German and the U.S. force.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Set up U.N. Mission in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided on Friday to set up a U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) to organize and conduct a popular consultation on the
future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
The Council adopted a resolution which says the Mission will
have political, electoral and public information components.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also authorizes the deployment of 280 civilian
police officers to act as advisers to the Indonesian police and 50
military liaison officers to maintain contact with the Indonesian
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The council calls for an end to violence and a laying down of
arms by all armed groups in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The consultation was scheduled for August 8 in the form of a
direct ballot to ascertain whether the majority of the 800,000
East Timorese will choose special autonomy within Indonesia or
separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of some 19,000 square kilometers, had
been a Portuguese colony until 1975. An internal rift led to
Indonesia' occupation of the territory and in 1976 it became a
province of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Portugal agreed on May 5 that a ballot to
determine the territory's future will be organized by the U.N.
Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
The agreement proposes that the Secretary-General set up a U.N.
Mission for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided on Friday that the Mission's
mandates end on August 31.

TAIYUAN, June 12 (Xinhua) --Two iridium satellites were
successfully carried into orbit by a Chinese Long March 2C rocket
which was fired from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north
China's Shanxi Province at 1:15 am (Beijing Time) today.
</P>
<P>
This is the 57th satellite launching, and the 15th consecutive
successful launch since October 1996 for the Long March rocket
series.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said this proves that the carrier rockets
independently developed by China are reliable and that the country
's space launch and control technologies are now more
sophisticated and mature.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites launched by China today will join up with
and further boost the existing iridium satellite system, a global
telecommunications network developed by the Motorola company.
</P>
<P>
So far China has recorded success in six consecutive similar
satellite launches.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that today's successful launch once again
demonstrates to the world that China's space ambitions are fully
devoted to the peaceful utilization of space resources and the
welfare of human beings; and that ongoing co-operation between
China and other countries in the field of space technology is in
the interests of all sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Russia and the United
States on Moscow's peacekeeping role in Kosovo dragged on Friday
as the negotiations "grow complicated" as Russian troops, some
already inside Yugoslavia, stand ready to enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations have grown complicated, a search for
decisions is underway and statements will be made after a result
is reached," Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
said, referring to talks between Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
"No decisions are expected today," the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations began in an expanded format and continued as a
tete-a-tete conversation, Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Talbott left Moscow for Brussels early Friday after bilateral
military-technical talks on Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo,
which had lasted for two-days, went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
But he returned to Moscow after being informed on the movement
of Russian paratroopers from Bosnia to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The troops have already left Belgrade, heading south towards
Kosovo, media reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources at the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, Tass
said the peacekeepers from the Russian air-borne brigade in Bosnia
have moved towards the Kosovo border to synchronize the bringing
in of the Russian contingent and NATO into the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
accused Washington and NATO of "breeding difficulties" in the
talks on deployment of a Russian contingent in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are acting in conformity with the U.N. Security Council
resolution clearly saying that security forces that are being
created would have a joint command but not a NATO command," Lukin
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely right in our actions," he said.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the East
African Cooperation (EAC), Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, are
speeding up preparations to enhance their relations to a community
by signing a treaty scheduled on July 30.
</P>
<P>
They have submitted amendment proposals for the draft treaty to
the EAC Secretariat based in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha,
sources from Arusha said Friday.
</P>
<P>
An extraordinary meeting of the Permanent Tripartite
Commission, the highest body of EAC, is scheduled to take place on
July 15 to consider the revised text of the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will meet again on July 29 to adapt the final
text of the treaty for the signing by presidents of the three
neighboring states in Arusha,!1 the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting of the commission, however, ministers and
experts concerned from the three states will meet to revise the
draft treaty before it is forwarded to their Attorneys Generals
for finalization.
</P>
<P>
The EAC secretariat is expected to spend about 55,000 U.S.
dollars for the signing ceremony accompanied by other activities
including a cultural festival and a trade exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded in 1996 on the basis of the defunct East
African Community that collapsed in 1977 due to reasons including
the divergence of economic and political policies then pursued by
the member states. Since its foundation, the EAC has tried to
address the shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation
initiatives.

UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Friday recommended to extend the mandate of United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a further
period of six months until December 31, 1999.

</P>
<P>
In the existing circumstances, the presence of UNFICYP on
the island remains indispensable for the maintenance of the
ceasefire between the Greek Cypriot and Turkey Cypriot
communities, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP, established in March 1964, was aimed to prevent a
recurrence of fighting between the two sides and to contribute
to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return
to normal conditions.

MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan's parliament on Friday
overwhelmingly ratified a production-sharing agreement with a
Japanese oil consortium, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which will go into effect with approval of Azeri

Teikoku with 7.5 percent and Itochu with 7.5 percent. The SOCAR
holds the remaining 50 percent, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The companies formed the Japan Azerbaijan Oil Corporation
(JAOC) on February 24, 1999, to carry out the project.
</P>
<P>
The period for the contract is 25 years, but it may be extended
for five years upon agreement with SOCAR. Reserves in the contract

</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative explained that the polling officers
would also determine whether the people of East Timor accept or
reject the proposed constitutional framework providing for a
special autonomy for East Timor within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will have the largest monitor team participating in the
exercise from Africa, she added.
</P>
<P>
"I see this as another input in the efforts of the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) in collaboration with the donor
community in Zambia to promote good governance," she said.
</P>
<P>
Akerele also noted that the experience the 32 Zambian polling
officers would gain East Timor will eventually be of benefit to
the whole nation in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the Zambian monitors will leave the country
Sunday and the whole group is expected to return home late August
this year.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, which is a former colony of Portugal, became
independent in 1975 but nine days after independence, it was
occupied by Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Regional Meeting on Refugees Ends in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The fourth meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Asia-Pacific Consultations (APC) on Refugees,
Displaced Persons and Migrants concluded here Friday with the
participants reiterating their commitment to the process.
</P>
<P>
The chairman's summary issued at the end of the two-day meeting
said the participants from 22 governments and organizations
emphasized the informal and non-binding character of the
consultations and agreed to a number of proposals.
</P>
<P>
First, they agreed to the convening of expert group meetings
under the auspices of the APC on the two themes of the
repatriation and reintegration of refugees and the return of
irregular migrants and region-wide data collection and information
sharing.
</P>
<P>
Second, as trafficking was widely identified as a topic for
priority attention, the meeting called on the International
Organization for Migration to build on the progress already
achieved and to report back to the APC.
</P>
<P>
Third, as burden sharing was identified as another priority
topic, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was
requested to report on this topic to the next annual session of
the APC.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the participants agreed that sub-regional group
meetings like the South Pacific region would be held at the
earliest opportunity, the chairman's summary said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting considered three papers prepared by Nepal, the
UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration on the role
of countries of origin from the perspectives of refugees,
displaced persons and migrants.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the role and responsibility of countries of
origin could not be viewed in isolation but rather in conjunction
with those of transit and receiving countries, in light of the
mutually interlocking and reinforcing nature of these roles and
responsibilities as well as the overall interests of the concerned
countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting observed that return to countries of origin is an
important solution to the unregulated movement of people in the
region through voluntary repatriation of refugees and through
speedy return of irregular migrants.
</P>
<P>
The obligations of the countries of origin, notably in regard
to the re-admission of their nationals, were also emphasized by
the participants.
</P>
<P>
The need for international, regional and bilateral cooperation
and dialogue on this issue and the involvement of the
international community was underlined as well at the meeting
co-hosted by the Nepalese government and the UNHCR with the
support of the International Organization for Migration.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that the fifth APC meeting should be held
in mid-2000 and, in the interests of maintaining geographical
balance, preferably in East Asia with the themes of trafficking
and burden sharing on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
The APC was initiated in November 1996 with a view to promoting
dialogue and exploring opportunities for greater regional
cooperation on matters relating to population movements.
</P>
<P>
The APC Secretariat has been formally established in Bangkok as
a support mechanism to further dialogue and contact between the
APC governments.

ATHENS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister
Yiannos Kranidiotis on Friday discussed with the European Union's
envoy for the Middle East, Miguel Moratinos, the meeting of Israelis
and Palestinians which will take place in Athens in July.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the talks, Kranidiotis said that Greece believed
that the new Israeli government led by Ehud Barak would give fresh
impetus to the Middle East peace process and for this reason, Greece
attached particular importance to the fourth meeting from July 7-11.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that the Athens meeting provided a safety net which
allowed problems between the two peoples to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Athens meeting is to create a climate of
confidence between the Israeli and Palestinian assemblies which will
help the two governments find an overall, lasting and viable solution
to the Middle East problem.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming Athens meeting is expected to make a decision on the
formation of five committees, an inter-parliamentary committee, a
committee for resolving problems arising in everyday life, an economic

<HEADLINE> Zambians Urged to Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Nkandu Luo
said Friday that the time has come for all Zambian people to tune
their minds and look at AIDS as a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national workshop in Ndola, Copperbelt Province,
on HIV/ AIDS counselling in Zambia, Luo called for the inclusion
of people from across the society in the development of policy on
HIV/AIDS in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
She said that AIDS is a serious problem which should worry
everyone because it was claiming lives of people in the most
productive age group.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to fight the "war" against the epidemic because
the enemy is invisible to most people except those who are trained
and could see it (virus) under the microscope, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Luo noted that very often when policies were being drawn up,
ordinary people from the public were left out.
</P>
<P>
Only a policy that is sensitive to the needs of everyone would
succeed, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said workshops for instance could include hotel
workers who are sometimes hosts to sex workers.
</P>
<P>
She added that journalists are among the people who play a
major role in disseminating information on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Luo also appealed to the participants at the workshop to
incorporate traditional aspects of counselling into new policies,
saying that counselling has various aspects and needs to be
cultural sensitive.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a daunting proportion of the Zambian
population were HIV positive.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Resumes Between Ethiopia, Eritrea: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Fighting has resumed between
Ethiopia and Eritrea after an almost-two-week lull in the
year-long conflict, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, both of the two Horn of Africa
neighbors confirmed that fighting had broken out along their
disputed border, accusing the other of firing the first shot.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by Eritrean Foreign Ministry in Asmara
Friday said that Ethiopia launched "a larger offensive" along the
central flank of the Mereb Setit front, close to the disputed
Badme region where the war first erupted early last May.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Director of the President Office, Yermane Gebremeskel,
also said Thursday that the Ethiopian forces Wednesday attacked on
the southeastern Burie front, 70 km west from Eritrea's Red Sea
port of Assab, adding that it was a minor attack.
</P>
<P>
However, spokeswoman of the Ethiopian government, Selome
Taddesse, said in Addis Ababa that "the ethiopian forces launched
a counter-offensive to repulse the invasions by Eritrea on two
fronts."
</P>
<P>
She added that Ethiopia used its air force against the Eritrean
troops.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea claimed that its forces killed 47 Ethiopian soldiers
and wounded about 100 others. But casualties are not available on
the Eritrean side.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Asmara said Friday that there is in sight no
immediate diplomatic solution to the conflict which has claimed
tens of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the sources said that the United Nations may pay
more attention to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict which has ignited a
race of armament and worsened the humanitarian situation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the two nations has continued
intermittently on three fronts along the 1,000 km border for over
one year.

<HEADLINE> Massive Inflow of Bank Notes Rocks Somali Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A consignment of Somali bank
notes worth 30 billion shillings (about three million U.S.
dollars) transported on a large plane chartered by faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid Friday landed at the airport of Ballidogleh,
90 km south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 battle wagons and more than 500 heavily armed
militiamen loyal to Aidid have escorted the money safely to the
Somali capital, according to sources close to the headquarters of
Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
The source furthermore said the money would be used for
boosting the political leverage as well as raising the morale of
Aidid's militiamen in Somalia which has been without central
government for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
This new consignment followed the arrival just two days ago of
a larger businessmen-owned one worth more than five million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen's consignment had devaluated the Somali
shilling to more than 300 shillings to one U.S. dollar and Aidid's
consignment will further devaluate the shilling.
</P>
<P>
Business dealers of the main markets have already quit selling
their commodities in shillings for fear of serious losses.
</P>
<P>
Traders in Bakara market are expressing concern that owners of
these consignments may try to collect dollars from the markets and
the race for exchanging their shillings with the dollars will
devaluate the shilling to a new low.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meager economy of Somalia is envisaged to plunge
further into an almost non-recoverable level as more Somali bank
notes are flowing into the main business center.
</P>
<P>
The import of the illegal bank notes and the massive inflow of
arms supplies into Somalia for the opposing factions are adding up
to the long- standing chaos as well as complicating the search for
a lasting solution to Somalia's political crisis.

NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot archaeologists have found
a 3,500-year-old Bronze Age tomb which is complete with artifacts
and human skeletons, local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made two days ago in a British base at
Xylotymbou village, a statement of the base said.

The base informed the Antiquities Department, and inspectors
began excavations immediately. Experts estimated that the
untouched tomb, which consisted of two chambers, dated back
between 1,400 BC and 1,600 BC
</P>
<P>
A total of 156 objects, including bronze items, necklace beads
and pottery, were found in the tomb. Fifteen human skeletons were
also unearthed from the tomb.
</P>
<P>
Senior archaelogical officer Pavlos Flourentzos said "it is

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
met with the European Union Ambassador to China on Friday to lodge
a serious complaint about the EU's decision to tighten controls on
wood packaging of Chinese exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hucheng, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, told Ambassador Endymion Wilkinson that China
reserves the right to take further actions.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission announced on June 1 that EU member
nations should take immediate steps to implement new inspection
standards for wood packaging used for China's exports beginning on
June 10. It notified the Chinese side of this decision on June 9.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to adversely affect some seven
billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese exports, ministry spokesman
Hu Chusheng said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gao told the ambassador that China was astonished at the EU
decision because the EU had refrained from notifying China or
conducting negotiations prior to the announcement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States, reacting
to Russian troops moving from Bosnia into Serbia, said on Friday
it wanted Russia to work in a coordinated fashion with NATO in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The movement of Russian troops from Bosnia into Yugoslavia
has caught Washington off guard and Vice President Al Gore said
earlier he was surprised by that swift movement.
</P>
<P>
P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the White House National Security
Council, said the Russians had assured Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that the deployment was a prepositioning of
forces so Russian troops can join the international security
force for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has been in Moscow
working on details of how the Russians can contribute troops to
the security force without falling under the command structure
of NATO. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been adamant that
Russian soldiers not be under the command of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly our impression based on Secretary Talbott's
discussion in Moscow that Russia desires to participate in KFOR
(the Kosovo security force) and their prepositioning of forces
is consistent with their desire to participate if the
appropriate formula can be worked out," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
But "our interest here is to make sure we work in a
coordinated fashion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Crowley was at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri
accompanying President Bill Clinton, who was making a visit to
this base.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Opens Legal Services to Off-Shore Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will allow off-shore
lawyers to practice legal services in a form of joint venture with
local lawyers and at the same time promote the regionalization of
law practice in Singapore, local media reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
For a start, the joint-venture firms are limited to just five
while a looser form of collaboration called formal alliance is
unlimited.
</P>
<P>
In addition, legal institutions are encouraged to provide
training grants and scholarships for overseas attachments in order
to help Singapore lawyers develop their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
These points, a shift from the country's current practice which
bans off-shore lawyers from providing legal advice for
transactions involving Singapore law, are contained in the Legal
Services Review Committee's recommendations which the government
has accepted as guidelines for liberalization of the legal sector.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization move is to enable legal services in
Singapore to keep pace with the opening-up of the financial sector
and meet the demand for legal services in an increasingly
sophisticated financial market.
</P>
<P>
The committee believes that the joint ventures will create
one-stop services for on-shore, off-shore and cross-border
transactions.
</P>
<P>
In the form of joint venture, the committee hopes, Singapore
lawyers will find it easier to benefit from off-shore lawyers'
expertise on cutting-edge financial products and grasp their
skills.
</P>
<P>
The committee hopes that more top-quality off-shore law firms
from more jurisdictions could be drawn to set up regional practice
here.
</P>
<P>
The government has expressed its readiness to consider
incentive schemes to promote the upgrading of Singapore lawyers
and encourage top-quality off-shore firms to locate here.
</P>
<P>
The government will also appoint a committee to be chaired by
the attorney general to oversee the implementation of the
recommendations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Rise 0.2 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Producer Price Index rose
just 0.2 percent in May, down sharply from the 0.5 percent advance
in April, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The slight increase reflected a big drop in energy prices, the
Department said. Gasoline prices at the wholesale level, which had
risen by a record 29.1 percent in April, retreated somewhat last
month, declining 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level is rising at
an annual rate of 2 percent after having been flat in 1998. The
acceleration in price pressures this year reflects a rebound in
energy. U.S. motorists got a big price break last year as the
global currency crisis created a glut of crude oil on world
markets, driving down prices.
</P>
<P>
For May, the 2.7 percent drop in gasoline prices, the biggest
decline since last December, offset increases in home heating oil
and natural gas, leaving overall energy costs unchanged for the
month following a 5.1 percent surge in April.
</P>
<P>
Food prices last month rose 0.5 percent after a big 0.9 percent
drop in April.
</P>

performance than a 1.9 percent rate of increase in the first five
months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Russia to Halve Prison Population by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Justice Minister Pavel
Krasheninnikov said here Friday that the country's prison
population might be cut by nearly a half by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The number of inmates will drop from the current one 1 million
to 500,000, Krasheninnikov said, noting that an amnesty bill
passed by the State Duma lower house of parliament in its first
reading clears the way for the release of 94,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The pardoned prisoners will be those who "do not pose a public
threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of Russia's correctional institutions is aimed at
the "humanization of the penitentiary system," the Interfax news
agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alternative punishment, including fines for minor crimes,
should be more frequently imposed, Krasheninnikov said.
</P>
<P>
The number of arrests should be reduced to a minimum, with the
exception of those committing particularly serious crimes, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Declining Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- There has been declining
productivity trends in Zimbabwe's economy over the past year as a
result of reduced output from key export sectors of mining and
manufacturing, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest weekly economic highlights, the central bank said
a productivity index with 1990 as the base year, showed that
mining and manufacturing sectors had fallen from 100 to 87.6 and
89.6 respectively in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The productivity index in the finance, insurance and real
estate also fell to 83.5 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Productivity will have to be enhanced through both
quantitative and qualitative improvements in economy-wide
accumulation of capital and human resource, skills development, as
well as by increasing export performance, " said the bank.
</P>
<P>
But in agriculture, the mainstay of the southern African
country's economy, productivity which had been on the decline from
1990, started to rise in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The distribution and hotels sector rose to 116.2 while another
good performance was the transport and communications whose
productivity rose sharply to 157.7.
</P>
<P>
But other key sectors of the economy still need to be improved
through the implementation of comprehensive structural reforms,
the central bank noted.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it was anticipated that the world economy would
post a modest recovery between 1999 and 2000 and Zimbabwe needs to
restore macro- economic statability in order to achieve growth.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Confirms Justice Arbour's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)
and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Louise
Arbour has resigned and there is no predicting for the time of her
successor's appointment, a U.N. spokesman said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Arbour, a Canadian, informed U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday of her intention to
resign and to take new duties at the Canadian Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the announcement by Canada's Justice Minister
of Arbour's appointment to the Supreme Court effective September
15.
</P>
<P>
Asked about when Arbour's successor will be appointed, Eckhard
said the nomination is a "fairly elaborate process", and he did
not know when.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will take a fair amount of consultation and there
is no predicting how long it will take. The important thing is
that an equally dynamic individual be selected to replace her," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arbour was named to the Tribunals in October 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Internet Marketing Firm Gains Access to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. company announced
Friday that it has received a license from the Chinese government
to market goods and services directly to the Chinese populace
through its Web site.
</P>
<P>
ChinaMallUSA.com Inc., an e-commerce company established in
1997 for the purpose of marketing Chinese and U.S. products
through the Internet, said that it is the only foreign firm to
receive such a comprehensive license allowing it to sell retail
throughout the entire country.
</P>
<P>
To date, according to the company, only Wal-Mart, the U.S.
department store giant, has been granted a license to establish a
retail store in China but that license is limited to operating in
Shenzhen, one of China's special economic zones.
</P>
<P>
China's retail market is huge, the company said, although there
are only four million households currently on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The e-commerce company has so far established partnerships with
two major Beijing-based retail businesses, as well as ties with
other three Chinese companies.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Peace Talks to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the ongoing Sierra
Leone peace talks in Lome, capital of Togo, have expressed their
willingness Friday to continue their discussions until achieving
positive outcomes.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started on May 25 between the warring rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and Sierra Leonean government,
have not yielded any substantial results, reports reaching here
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Present at the talks were representatives of the Sierra Leonean
 government and the rebels who have been fighting since 1991. A
cease-fire has been put in place since the talks started late
last month.
</P>
<P>
The mediators' committee, led by Francis Okelo, U.N.
secretary-general's special envoy in Sierra Leone, the U.S. and
British ambassadors in Sierra Leone, said it had informed Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema of their willingness to continue the
talks, as well as the remaining sticking points.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema is the current chairman of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), which has been playing a very
important role in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We came out of the discussion with the conviction that the
time is ripe for peace to be restored in Sierra Leone," Okelo
said.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, I think that if the Sierra Leoneans miss this
opportunity, it might not present itself again. It's now or
never," said the U.N. representative.
</P>
<P>
Okelo said what matters is not the duration of the negotiations
but rather the positive results that could finally be achieved
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting between the committee and Eyadema was the
second one within three days to review the progress in the peace
negotiations which have reportedly made some major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
However, sources closed to the mediators said the two sides are
still deadlocked on the issue of power-sharing under a
transitional government proposed by the RUF, the drawing of a new
constitution and the departure of foreign troops.

<HEADLINE> Cereal Output Short of Requirements: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- World cereal output in 1999
would not meet expected consumption requirements in 1999-2000,
according to the latest forecast by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Global cereal output in 1999 forecast at 1.858 billion tons
is 1.3% below last year's crop, FAO said in its June issue of food
outlook released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
FAO sees wheat output to reach 579 million tons, 2.6% down
from 1998 and coarse grains at 891 tons, 1.5% below the 1998
level. Global rice output is tentatively forecast to rise by 1.4%
to 387 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A major humanitarian emergency persists in Europe where
thousands of refugees have fled from Kosovo over the past weeks.
Elsewhere, serious food supply problems also persist in several
countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the report said.
</P>
<P>
FAO's forecast of world trade in cereals in 1999-2000 is 212
million tons, 5 million tons up from 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
Global trade in wheat is expected to go up by some 5% to 100
million tons, and that for coarse grains by almost 2% to 92
million tons.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, reduced rice trade is anticipated in response to
better production prospects among several major importing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Impact of Technology on Popular Culture to Be Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A three-day conference to be
held in October in Camden, Maine of the United States will examine
how technology is impacting popular culture throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Camden Technology Conference, organizer of the coming event,
said Friday that the conference will explore the cultural
implications of the intersections of digital technology with such
mass media as television, movies, radio, music and art. Ethernet
inventor Robert Metcalfe will be one of the conference hosts.
</P>
<P>
Among the subjects to be discussed at the conference, with the
theme of "popular culture in the digital age," are the
disappearance of the book, the merger of movies, television and
cyberspace, virtual reality intoxication, personal relationships
in the digital age, and good and evil in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
"Technology is redefining our culture, simultaneously for the
better and for the worse," Camden Technology Conference quoted its
board member Tom DeMarco as saying. "There is no question of
controlling this phenomenon; our best hope is to understand it and
perhaps to make a few minor course changes along the way."
</P>
<P>
The October conference is the third annual event staged by
Comden Technology Conference. The previous two conferences dealt
with how telecommunications reshape the American communities and
how technology and information change education.

<HEADLINE> G8 Urged to Improve Debt Relief to Poor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Friday called on the Group of Eight (G8) countries to improve
substantially debt relief terms for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at eliminating "once and for all" their debt
problem and permitting sustainable economic growth, according to a
press statement issued by the U.N. spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt problem of developing countries has
"dramatically worsened since the beginning of the 1990s" based on
the outlook for commodity prices and export volumes, the U.N.
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the medium term the ability to service their debts could
deteriorate further, with serious consequences for their
development prospects and basic human rights, it added.
</P>
<P>
The world body notes that over period 1990-1997 the heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) were able to service debt
equivalent to up to 18% of their exports on average.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the share of fiscal revenue to be allocated to
external debt service should be less than 25%.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank launched an initiative to address the HIPCs problem, but to
date only 3 of the 41 eligible countries on the list (Uganda,
Bolivia and Guyana) have benefited from debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply
Friday as fears for higher interest rates remained in the mind of
investors despite a tame inflation report.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 130.76 at
10,490.51. The index lost 309.33 point or 2.9 percent for the
week.
</P>
<P>
A government report said the Producer Price Index rose only 0.2
percent in May but the results could not ease market fears about
higher interest rates, which has become so pervasive on Wall
Street for the weeks.
</P>
<P>
Another report on rise in retail sales helped convince some
investors that an increase in interest rates was in the offing.
The retail sales rose one percent in May, a sign of economic
strength.
</P>
<P>
In addition, rumors spread this afternoon that the Federal
Reserve had held a special meeting to debate a rate increase,
causing the damage to the uneasy market in spite of refutation
later.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 9.18 at 1,293.64 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
index fell 37.74 at 2,447.88.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 3.35 at 619.50 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 2.43 at 765.82. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 4.26 at 438.01.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,712 down, 1,304 up and 530
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 687.71 million shares from 700.51

<HEADLINE> U.S. Winter Wheat Harvest to Drop 14 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Agriculture Department
on Friday predicted farmers would harvest 1.6 billion bushels of
winter wheat this year, down slightly from the May forecast and
off 14.4 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecast was in line with what analysts expected. A
steep decline in wheat prices last year spurred many farmers in
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas to sit out the winter and plant crops
like sorghum and soybeans this spring.
</P>
<P>
Winter wheat yields are up slightly nationwide, from 44.4
bushels per acre to 44.7 bushels per acre.
</P>
<P>
The department also said the nation's orange crop was forecast
to be off 28 percent from last year's record of 13.7 million tons,
because of extreme weather conditions last year when the fruit was
developing. The forecast for Florida's production is down 23
percent from a year ago, while California's is off by half.
</P>
<P>
Florida, the leading citrus state, is expected to harvest 8.4
million tons of oranges this year, a reduction of less than 1
percent from the May forecast.
</P>
<P>
The department's next crop report in July will provide a better
gauge of whether wheat prices will rebound, analysts said. Heavy
rainfall has soaked the Plains in recent weeks from Kansas to
North Dakota. The moisture could damage the winter wheat that
hasn't been harvested as well as lead to disease in newly planted
crops.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Hit U.S. Senate Web Site Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Hackers attacked the U.S.
Senate's main Web site Friday, the second such assault in just
over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The hackers defaced the Senate's Web page, but left its overall
look similar to how it normally appears.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
started investigating a May 27 attack on the Senate's Web site and
other hacker attacks on Web sites of the Department of Energy, the
FBI, the White House and the Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
"The FBI is investigating the first incident. That's under our
purview," spokeswoman Debbie Weierman said. "This current
(attack), I can't give you a reason why it happened."
</P>
<P>
The Senate said that technical experts planned to meet with the
FBI to put security measures in place.
</P>
<P>
A message left by hackers on the Senate's Web site May 27 said
that attack was carried out because of what it said was the FBI's
harassment of specific hacker groups, including the group that
boasted of breaking into the White House site earlier.
</P>
<P>
Computer crimes are increasing in recent years in the United
States as computer literacy grows.
</P>
<P>
A 1999 computer crime survey made by the Computer Security
Institute and the FBI's San Francisco office found that system
penetration by outsiders increased for the third year. Such
intrusions were reported by 30 percent of the 521 computer
security professionals surveyed.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Build 500,000 Houses for Low-Income Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
construct a total of 500,000 housing units for the low-income
group in the next two to three years under the prime minister's
housing scheme.
</P>
<P>
"The plan will be implemented in collaboration with
international and national construction companies in a transparent
manner," Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said in his budget speech
Saturday at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The proposed facilities under the scheme include:
</P>
<P>
-- Declaration of housing and construction as industry which
will enable banks to offer project loans for the housing sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Free of cost availability of land by government for houses
for the low-income group, which have very high market prices; and
</P>
<P>
-- Houses and apartments will be non-transferable for the first
five years from the date of occupation.
</P>
<P>
Dar said inadequate housing facilities are a major problem and
he referred to a survey which found that there is a backlog of 6.3
million housing units in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that not only these facilities are inadequate, most of
the people live in huts and mud-houses with no electricity, water
and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier promoted similar housing schemes
which had yielded positive results, Dar added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-British Energy-Saving Project Has Good Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The air quality of Guiyang, the
capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province, has been improved
thanks to a Sino-British energy saving project, which is aimed at
encouraging more industrial enterprises to enhance energy using
efficiency and reducing pollution.
</P>
<P>
Since the "Guizhou Energy Efficiency" project was initiated two
years ago, the British government has invested 13 million yuan (1.
57 million U.S. dollars) to help industrial enterprises in Guizhou
to renovate production technology in a bid to save energy and
reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest Sino-British scientific and
technological cooperation project in China, is implemented by the
British Energy Technology Support Utility (BETSU).
</P>
<P>
A coal mine in Guiyang, for example, reduced its emissions of
dust by 45 percent and sulphur dioxide by 40 percent after
technical renovations with the help of BETSU.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection experts from the province said that
one third of the area of Guizhou, which uses coal as its main fuel,
is affected by acid rain. So, the use of high quality, smokeless
coal must be encouraged if the province wants to meet the air
quality standard set by the State for year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The experts have estimated that if half of Guiyang's 50 small
boilers can use special smokeless coal, the city's discharge of
sulphur dioxide could be reduced by 30,000 tons a year and that of
dust, by 65,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Ouyang Ziyuan, an academician from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Guizhou plans to set up an industrial energy
efficiency and environmental protection center in order to take
advantage of new prospects in the energy saving sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
Clan and political motivated animosities are toppling
especially southern Somalia with the involvement of some foreign
troops supporting the opposing factions of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
It has been Baidoa town, a strategic point in southern
Somalia, that has fallen for the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)
backed by Ethiopia this week, a fighting which probably lit the
torch for more armed confrontations elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
A new alliance called "the Jubba Valley Alliance" Friday took
control of the Southern port town of Kismayu kicking out General
Mohamed Saeed Hirsi Morgan who controlled the town in the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Somali National Front (SNF) faction which
led the fighting of Kismayu said the town is calm Saturday with
the forces of the alliance fighting to return the rule of law and
order.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Igrahim Jama Howleh, said General Moragan's
forces have fled to Badhadheh Town, about 100 km west of Kismayu,
for possible reorganization. However, he said General Ahmed
Warsmeh of the SNF and his forces are chasing them away.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said at least 27 people have died from both
sides including eight civilians, while the wounded exceeded 46.
</P>
<P>
More than 25 of the wounded are reported to be civilians caught
in the cross fire.
</P>
<P>
At least six battle wagons have been captured or destroyed from
the forces of General Morgan before fleeing the town Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, reports from the central town of Galkaio, about
600 km north of Mogadishu, said violent demonstrations against the
fall of Kismayu Town took place Saturday in the heart of the town.
</P>
<P>
Angry women and children throwing stones have marched in the
police of the town have strongly reacted against the violence and
some shooting was heard.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation remains obscure as all of the field
radios of the town have gone out of the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese club P.L.A. Industrial
and Business Bank Club (ICBC) and Shanghai Edelweiss to fight for
the title of the first World Table Tennis Club Championships here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
ICBC, led by Olympic doubles champion Liu Guoliang, beat Team
Tetra Pak of Sweden 3-0 while Edelweiss defeat Borussia Dusseldorf
of Germany with an identical score.
</P>
<P>
Tetra Pak's all-time great Jan-Ove Waldner suffered a
humiliating defeat to rising star Ma Lin 22-20, 13-21, 16-21 in
the second match of the best-of-five clash.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who won the singles and doubles gold medals in the Atlanta
Olympic Games, put ICBC up 1-0 with a hard win over 1991 World
Champion Jorgen Persson 21-14, 14-21, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao sealed the victory for ICBC by brushing aside little
known Henrik Roswall 2-7, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
"I know we'll the winner after taking the first two matches
because Roswall is too weak," said Cai Zhenhua, head coach of the
ICBC.
</P>
<P>
"Ma Lin's victory shows that the young has had the caliber to
pose serious threat to any other star players in the world," Cai
added.
</P>
<P>
Cai, also head coach of the Chinese national team, said the win
over arch rival Sweden was a big step for them toward the World
Championships to be held in August in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The match is very helpful to our preparation for the World
Championships," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Persson, the only player left here who had not lost a match,
dropped the first set 21-14 but fought back to take the second set
21-14, pulling it even 1-1.
</P>
<P>
But Liu, also a key member of the winning Chinese team in the
last two World Championships, scored five points in a row for the
win when the third set was tied at 16-16.
</P>
<P>
"I should say I was very lucky at the crucial moment," the
world top-ranked Liu said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Waldnder, ranked fifth in the world, said: "I think we did not
play our best matches today. I have not found my form after coming
to China. We had expected a win of Persson could exert heavy
pressure on Ma Lin, but he failed."
</P>
<P>
But Waldner, world's lone player who has won a Grand Slam
titles of World Cup, World Championships and Olympic Games, said
he can play better in the coming World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"If we play in Europe, we will have a better chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
World silver medalist Vladimir Samsonov failed to turn the tide
around as he lost to Feng Zhe 23-21, 15-21, 20-22 in the second
match for Dusseldorf.
</P>
<P>
Chinese national Wang Liqin gave Edelweiss a 1-0 lead by
beating Koji Matsushita in their opening match.
</P>
<P>
Edelweiss' teenager Guo Jinhao scored a surprise win over
Michael Maze to send his club to the finals.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed," Samsonov said. "I had believed I would
win after taking the first set."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Unit Relieved After Rebel Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police (PNP)
officer-in-charge Edmundo Larroza Saturday ordered the relief of
Batuan Police Unit in southern Bohol Province following a raid by
New Peoples Army (NPA) rebels of their camp on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Larroza has ordered that Police Inspector Richard Caballero and
his 36 men be relieved of their posts in Batuan Police Station and
proceed to nearby Tagbilaran City for investigation, PNP spokesman
Nicanor A. Bartolome said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Larroza castigated Caballero and the 36 non-commissioned
officers for lapses in security that enabled some 200 New People's
Army to sneak into their camp without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas carted away 50 high-powered firearms, including
two M-60 machine-guns, three M-203 grenade launchers and one 60mm
mortar and held two policemen hostage.
</P>
<P>
But the hostages were released unharmed at Batuan later on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The raid was the most daring staged by the NPA since its
political arm, the National Democratic Front, pulled out of the
peace talks to protest over the senate ratification of the
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).
</P>
<P>
The ratification of the VFA paved way for the resumption of
large-scale military exercises between the United States and the
Philippines in the country.

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.

<HEADLINE> No Headway Achieved in Indo-Pak Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- No headway has been achieved in
the foreign minister-level talks held here Saturday between India
and Pakistan over the Kashmir crisis, official sources said here.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan remained deadlocked in the talks between
foreign ministers of India and Pakistan, Jaswant Singh and Sartaj
Aziz, as the two sides were widely divided over the issue of the
Line of Control (LOC) in the Kashmir area.
</P>
<P>
Singh said in the talks that the LOC was well-defined and
well-delineated on authentic maps signed by military authorities
of both countries while Aziz stuck to the stand that the LOC was
delineated on paper but not clearly demarcated on the ground,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
India urged Pakistan to "vacate its armed intrusion and
aggression from across the LOC in Kargil," saying defusing of the
crisis in Kargil would be possible only by restoring the status
quo along the LOC without further loss of time.
</P>
<P>
Singh and Aziz began their talks here as soon as the latter
arrived here from Islamabad and their talks lasted two-and-a-half
hours. The official sources said the talks were held in a "serious
and business-like atmosphere." Aziz, who was greeted by Singh on
his arrival for a one-day visit, drove from the airport straight
to the meeting venue Hyderabad House without talking to waiting
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's talks were held under the shadow of the release by
India Friday of transcripts of telephone conversations between two
Pakistan top generals on May 26 and 29, showing that the Pakistan
Army was behind the armed intrusion. Pakistan said these tapes
were part of India's propaganda against Pakistan.

SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Striker Zhang Yuning headed two
goals and set up one as hosts China thrashed Vietnam 3-0 in an
Asian Group Seven second leg qualifier for the Sydney 2000
Olympics here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hot favorites terrorized the opposite box for the whole
first half but fell short of breaking through a Vietnamese side
desperately intent on defence.
</P>
<P>
Not until the 50th minute did the home side go in front when
midfielder Zhao Junzhe headed a powerful Zhang Yuning cross into
the net.
</P>
<P>
Zhang doubled the lead on 63 minutes by turning in a Huang Yong
cross and seven minutes later, he combined with Zhao again for a
spectacular raking header and his sixth goal in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
China's English coach Bobby Houghton blamed his players for
being "too cautious" in the first half against an opposite side
whose only hope seemed to be minimizing the Chinese score.
</P>
<P>
"We can't go through because there are so many bodies there (in
the box). At the second half we go around from both sides to score
three goals," the former Nottingham Forest coach said.
</P>
<P>
Pham Quang, chief of the Vietnamese team, said he was satisfied
with the result since they lost their first leg home match in
Hanoi 4-0 two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
China had all but secured their place in the next round knock-
out competition after scoring their fourth consecutive win of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The winner of Group seven will advance to the second round of
Olympic qualifiers, meeting eight other group winners from across
Asia on a knockout stage. The top three finishers from that
competition will qualify for Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Entertaining Programs Flood Chinese TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese viewers can now find as
many as six entertaining TV programs with celebrities as guests to
watch at prime time on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
Well-known actors and pop stars from the Chinese mainland, and
from Taiwan and Hong Kong, are often invited to participate in
these shows. And their main task is to arouse laughter in the
audience, sometimes by making fun of themselves, and they are
attracting more and more people.
</P>
<P>
However, such programs have also caused some conflict among
people, many of whom criticize these shows as vulgar and dull, and
lacking in redeeming social value.
</P>
<P>
The first two entertainment programs created by China Central
Television (CCTV), one focused on song and dances, and the other
on knowledge contests, now face stiff competition from these other
shows.
</P>
<P>
The audience rate for a pop-filled program initiated by the
Hunan TV Station in central China has now reached 33 percent,
second only to the CCTV News, and cost of advertising on them
already exceeds the average charged by CCTV programs.
</P>
<P>
There was nothing like them on Chinese TV for some 30 years,
not until implementation of the reform and opening-up policy in
late 1978. However, things have changed in the past decade, and
the fierce media competition is puzzling TV stations all around
the country, and as they ponder which direction to go, and many
have chosen to follow the model of Hong Kong and Taiwan popular
entertainment programs.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 20 similar entertainment programs launched
by local TV stations nationwide, which some people said are too
many and stereotyped.

Saturday for fear that NATO would enter the war-stricken Yugoslav
province under the facade of sluggish negotiations, according to
the Interfax news agency.

The agency, quoting military sources, said that the Russian
leadership was forced to do so because they had learned that the U.
S.-led alliance planned to "flood with words" in the negotiating
process with Moscow so as to complete its own deployment first. (

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Talks on Russia's peacekeeping role
in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo resumed here Saturday as NATO
and Russia moved their troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started Friday and lasted until 06:00 (02:00
GMT) Saturday morning, were participated by Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on the Russian side and
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Pentagon
representatives of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Russian military experts left here around
noon and flew to Macedonia to conduct talks with Pentagon
officials, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting the defense
ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, to be held near the Yugoslav border, the
Russian Defense Ministry representatives intend to determine
Russia's zone of responsibility in Kosovo, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported that Russia's representative to NATO, General Viktor
Zavarzin, is in Pristina, capital of the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources with the Defense Ministry, Tass said Zavarzin,
who was recalled following the commencement of NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia on March 24, arrived in Pristina early Saturday
with the convoy of Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Russia's ties with NATO remain frozen and Moscow said they
would only resume when NATO's military actions against Yugoslavia
cease. NATO has only announced a pause, rather than a complete
stop, to the 78-day bombing campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government forces have
captured about 350 square kilometers of land in the northern Wanni
area from the hands of Tamil rebels in a surprise offensive, the
Defense Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The operation which began on Thursday has completed the link-up
with the coastal line before dawn on Saturday, a ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no confrontation with Tamil rebels as the
troops were able to maintain the surprise until the area was
captured.
</P>
<P>
The newly captured area comprises 28 villages in Mannar
district, with a population of about 20,000.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' locations in the adjacent areas were engaged by the
Sri Lankan Air Force and artillery after the capture, the
spokesman said, adding that the casualties were not known.
</P>
<P>
The offensive followed fierce fighting on Thursday further
north near the town of Paranthan, where the government said 45
rebels were killed and 16 government troops lost.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting ended a four-week lull in the island's
embattled north and east where the Tamil rebels have been fighting
for an independent homeland since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Last month, government troops backed by aircraft and artillery
won control over a dozen villages after two days of heavy fighting
that killed 42 rebels and 17 soldiers.

KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,500 rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) have been killed since the
government army launched a crackdown in western Uganda since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government troops had overrun several ADF camps and
hide-outs in the mountains and that only 210 rebels were still
hiding in Kabarole forests, the Monitor daily reported Saturday.
</P>

Vital rebel documents concerning their operations had been
recovered, the report quoted the Second Division Public Relations
Officer Nasuru Kibirige as telling reporters recently.

<P>
Wang Tao sealed the victory for ICBC by brushing aside little
known Henrik Roswall 2-7, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
"I know we'll the winner after taking the first two matches
because Roswall is too weak," said Cai Zhenhua, head coach of the
ICBC.
</P>
<P>
"Ma Lin's victory shows that the young has had the calibre to
pose serious threat to any other star players in the world," Cai
added.
</P>
<P>
Cai, also head coach of the Chinese national team, said the win
over arch rival Sweden was a big step for them toward the World
Championships to be held in August in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The match is very helpful to our preparation for the World
Championships," Cai said.
</P>
<P>
Persson, the only player left here who had not lost a match,
dropped the first set 21-14 but fought back to take the second set
21-14, pulling it even 1-1.
</P>
<P>
But Liu, also a key member of the winning Chinese team in the
last two World Championships, scored five points in a row for the
win when the third set was tied at 16-16.
</P>
<P>
"I should say I was very lucky at the crucial moment," the
world top-ranked Liu said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Waldnder, ranked fifth in the world, said: "I think we did not
play our best matches today. I have not found my form after coming
to China. We had expected a win of Persson could exert heavy
pressure on Ma Lin, but he failed."
</P>
<P>
But Waldner, world's lone player who has won a Grand Slam
titles of World Cup, World Championships and Olympic Games, said
he can play better in the coming World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"If we play in Europe, we will have a better chance," he said.

<HEADLINE> New High-Grade Highway for Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Work began today on a high grade
94 kilometers long highway in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It will run from Guyaozi in Linwu City to Wangquanliang at the
junction of Shaanxi Province and is part of a national transport
artery from Qingdao, a coastal city in east China's Shandong
Province, to Yinchuan, Ningxia's capital city, via Taiyuan,
capital of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The highway will be built at a cost of 720 million yuan (86.75
million US dollars), including 40 million US dollars of loans from
the World Bank, according to Wang Quanshi, vice-chairman of the
regional people's government, who added that it will be the first
highway project that involves overseas funds in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Work is scheduled for completion in October 2001 and the two-
lane highway will allow speeds of 100 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
This will be an important link between Ningxia and economically
advantaged east Chinese regions and coastal areas, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia plans to invest 1.78 billion yuan (214.46 million US
dollars), which equals the total investment in the region in the
decade from 1986 to 1995, to build highways this year, in an
effort to give an impetus to economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A high speed electric train
which can reach speeds of 200 kilometers per hour, the first of
its kind designed and manufactured in China, has come off the
production line today at the Changchun Passenger Railway Car Plant
in northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The train, jointly manufactured by the plant and the Zhuzhou
Electrical Locomotive Plant and three other work units, will run
between Guangzhou and Shenzhen in south China after passing
operational trials.
</P>
<P>
"Electric powered locomotives are considered safe, convenient,
pollution free and ideal for shuttle services between cities and
between downtown and suburban areas," said Chen Junchuan, section
chief of the design department of the plant in Changchun, the
capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
The development of high speed trains is a key state scientific
and technological project which is an essential part of the Ninth
Five Year (1996-2000) Plan.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun Locomotive Car Plant is now designing a train
which can reach speeds of 300 kilometers per hour and a hover
train, according to director Ma Shukun.
</P>
<P>
China began to improve train speeds on April 1, 1997, and the
average speed of the country's trains has subsequently increased
to 54.9 km from 48.1 km per hour. On the three major lines from
Beijing to Guangzhou, Shanghai and Harbin, trains now run at 140
km per hour.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plays Down Russian Deployment in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Saturday played down the
surprise entry of Russian troops into the Kosovo capital of
Pristina ahead of NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson told BBC radio that the
incident only involved "a very small number of Russian soldiers,
200 at most, who had allowed their enthusiasm for joining the
peacekeepers to get ahead of military discipline."
</P>
<P>
The Russians arrived in Pristina in the early hours of Saturday
morning, several hours ahead of schedule and causing huge surprise
to the NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the incident was "a sideshow" compared to the
overall size and complexity of the unfolding peacekeeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
It would not have any major effect on the operation to make
Kosovo safe for hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees
to return, he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain is contributing around 13,000 troops to the 50,000-
strong Kosovo peace implementation force which began deploying
into the region in the early hours of the morning.

<HEADLINE> China Seizes Oil Smuggling Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Customs authorities in east China'
s Lianyungang Port in Jiangsu Province recently seized an oil
tanker carrying 1,500 tons of suspected smuggled diesel.
</P>
<P>
According to sources here at the General Administration of
Customs, the oil tanker Hengjiao was brought into custody on June
8 by a customs cruiser while it was navigating the Huanghai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Officials found that the vessel was carrying 1,500 tons of
diesel valued at over two million yuan (241,000 US dollars), but
its staff could not present any effective transportation documents
nor the navigation diary. It was then escorted to the port.
</P>
<P>
Investigations by the customs authorities and the anti-
smuggling police proved that the diesel had been smuggled in from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have confiscated the diesel and detained the
suspects, while the vessel is still in the custody of the customs.
</P>
<P>
The recent crackdown on smuggling in south China has forced
smugglers to move their activities to the north, the sources said,
adding that they now tend to use bigger vessels.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO troops rolled into Kosovo near dawn Satursday to begin
the allied occupation of the shattered province, hours after a
convoy of Russian military vehicles stunned Western leaders and
apparently even officials in Moscow by arriving here first.
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of fleeing Serbian civilians turned the black roads
of Kosovo into ribbons of despair Friday, packing their belongings
into cars and trucks and onto tractors and joining the intensified
withdrawal of heavily armored Yugoslav forces from the province.
</P>
<P>
-- The campaign for the presidency in 2000 has had an Alice-in-
Wonderland Quality from the very start, but never more than the
moment at hand. "Sentence first--verdict afterwards" has nothing
on this campaign. For the next week it will be "general election
now, primaries to come."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton visited Whiteman Air Force Base, the home
of the B-2 stealth bomber, to extol American air power, but he
devoted as much of his speech to praising American-style race
relations, asserting that NATO's victory in Kosovo had been one of
ethnic diversity over "ethnic cleansing."
</P>
<P>
-- A team of F.B.I agents are going to Kosovo this weekend to
assess the forensic needs of the international authorities who are
about to start the most thorough inquiry into war crimes since
World War II, Federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States told Libya, in the first official meeting
in 18 years, that it would not support the complete lifting of
sancitions until Libya stopped supporting international terrorism
and met other conditions required by U.N. resolutions, diplomats
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Forced to Move Troops to Kosovo: Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia promptly deployed its
troops in Kosovo early Saturday for fear that NATO would enter the
war-stricken Yugoslav province under the facade of sluggish
negotiations, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency, quoting military sources, said that the Russian
leadership was forced to do so because they had learned that the U.
S.-led alliance planned to "flood with words" in the negotiating
process with Moscow so as to complete its own deployment first.
</P>
<P>
If the Russian paratroopers had not been transferred to
Pristina, capital city of Kosovo, last night, they would never be
deployed there, the sources said, adding "Moscow was made to move
ahead."
</P>
<P>
In an earlier report, Interfax said movement of Russian troops
into Kosovo was coordinated "at the top level" in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
These actions were "strictly regulated by a plan" which
envisioned various options with regard to changes in the situation,
Interfax said, quoting informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said earlier that the
entry into Kosovo of the Russian troops was unfortunate as orders
were given for them to pull out.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told CNN that the appearance in Pristina of Russian
military personnel unfortunately did take place, while the reasons
for this are being determined.
</P>
<P>
"They have been ordered to leave Kosovo immediately and to
await further orders," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian officers said that no orders have been issued
for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the Russian contingent in Yugoslavia is likely to be
reinforced in the near future, Interfax reported, quoting a high-
ranking military official.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 paratroopers and 40 armored vehicles and tanks,
which arrived in Pristina at 04:30 a.m. Moscow time (0030 GMT),
are being placed at the Slatina airport, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a strategic facility and conducting reconnaissance is a
necessary measure," he said. Fighter jets and transportation
aircraft can land at the airdrome outside Pristina, he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asks EU to Deal With Dioxin Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Saturday asked the
European Union (EU) Commission to clarify the dioxin contamination
of its meat and diary products and constantly brief the world on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Datuk Chuan Jui Meng said Saturday that the
commission should immediately run tests to confirm that their
products are safe from such contamination so that a standard
certification could be issued for products that are safe for
consumption.
</P>
<P>
"In Malaysia, we don't have the capacity to run tests on the
products that are contaminated, so do many other countries. As
long as the EU countries do not come up with the certification
required, we have to reject their products," Chuan said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government move to ban the products was for the
safety and well-being of the people, especially the babies who had
not formed antibodies.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to heed government directives rather than
getting confused with the advertisements put up by manufacturers
and importers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Health Minister Datuk Wira Ali Rustam also
said the ministry would ensure that retailers were not hiding the
banned meat and dairy products imported from the EU countries.
</P>
<P>
He said importers and retailers who did not comply with the
directives of the ministry could be prosecuted under the Food
Quality Control Act.
</P>
<P>
The ministry checked all imported products containing dioxin
from January 1 this year and would compare the records on the
amount of products imported, kept in stock and the amount sold, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If there are any balance and we don't find them, it means they
(retailers) had hidden them. We will ask where they are hiding
them.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way for the importers to run away from the system
we (ministry) are using now, because we trace the (banned) goods
from the beginning till the end. The public need not worry," Ali
Rustam told reporters here Saturday.

<HEADLINE> New Fiscal Year Budget Welcomed in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Saturday described the federal budget for 1999-2000 as a
"shining example of good governance and transparency."
</P>
<P>
"The national budget is an outcome of total commitment, honesty
and integrity," the prime minister said while talking to newsmen
at the National Assembly after presentation of the budget by
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the waiving of local bodies taxes is a good step
towards elimination of corruption, adding that the old system
caused humiliation to the people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister went on to say that it is "really
appreciable" that despite many obstacles, the country has achieved
a growth rate of 3.1 percent in the current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the efforts by Dar for abolishing the perks of VIPs.
"He worked with dedication and commitment to bring the country out
of the serious financial crisis," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce
and Industry Fazlur Raham Dittu termed the new budget as a
"balanced budget".
</P>
<P>
The abolition of what-is-called "zillah" and octroi taxes is a
revolutionary step of the present government, which will save the
traders from "extortion" by the contractors of zillah taxes,
according to Dittu.
</P>
<P>
"This step will have a positive impact on overall economy," he
remarked.
</P>
<P>
Dittu pointed out that the businessmen were fed up with
harassment and payment of extortion money in the name of octroi
tax and now this money will be invested in the trade and industry,
which will be a positive thing.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Stadium Officially Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, June 12 (Xinhua) The main stadium for the 2000 Sydney
Olympics Games was officially opened Saturday by a stellar cast of
world soccer talent and an emotional performance from pop group
INXS.
</P>
<P>
The world's most expensive soccer player, Italy's Christian
Vieri, joined a FIFA All Star team against Australia's national
side for an exhibition game after a two-hour opening ceremony in
the 450 million U.S. dollars arena.
</P>
<P>
While SOCOG president Michael Knight declared the venue open
Saturday night more than 104,000 fans watched a rugby league club
double-header here four months ago. Another 88,000 came on
Wednesday for a rugby league representative match in torrential
rain and Chapman made the embarrassing admission that parts of the
roof leaked.
</P>
<P>
Fans paid between 45 U.S. dollars and 180 U.S. dollars to watch
Saturday's opening ceremony in the cavernous venue standing 14
storeys standing 180 feet high.
</P>
<P>
With parking strictly limited, the majority arrived at the
stadium by train and for many it was the first look of the 2000
Games centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen stadiums all over the world but nothing like this,"
said Lynnette Brown, 61, of Sydney. "It's state of the art and it
looks great."
</P>
<P>
The FIFA team, led by retired German star Jurgen Klinsmann, was
criticized for being below strength after a scheduling clash with
the 36 European Championship ties in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's captain Leonardo, England's Matt Le Tissier and Vieri
were the undoubted drawcards in the combination teamwhile the
match gave Australian fans a first look at their full team since a
heartbreaking failure to reach last year's World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United's new goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, Leeds' Harry
Kewell and Celtic's Mark Viduka were the stars of the Socceroos
while the combined talent was worth more than the stadium itself.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Orders "Active" Part in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
given order to "actively participate in the implementation of the
international civilian presence and the international security
presence" in Kosovo, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to participate in all operations envisioned by
the U.N. Security Council resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who arrived in the Kremlin for ceremonies marking the
Russian Independence Day, gave the instruction in a working
meeting on the situation in Yugoslavia with Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
The session followed a meeting earlier Saturday of Sergeyev and
senior staff of the Defense Ministry and the General Headquarters
aiming at "readiness for further actions in Yugoslavia in the
event the supreme commander issues pertinent orders," the Interfax
news agency reported said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency reported that more Russian servicemen, mostly
paratroopers, have been ready for departure for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Quoting military sources, Interfax said IL-76 military
transportation aircraft were prepared for the reinforcement at
Ivanovo, Ryazan and Pskov aerodromes.
</P>
<P>
"Crews were transferred to the regime of four-hour readiness
for take-off, and aircraft technicians do not leave aerodromes,"
the military sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian officers said that no orders have been
issued for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Pristina, capital
of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, as Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov had said before.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the Russian contingent in Yugoslavia is likely to be
reinforced in the near future, Interfax reported, quoting a high-
ranking military official.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 paratroopers and 40 armored vehicles and tanks,
which arrived in Pristina at 04:30 a.m. Moscow time (0030 GMT),
are being placed at the Slatina airport, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a strategic facility and conducting reconnaissance is a
necessary measure," he said. Fighter jets and transportation
aircraft can land at the aerodrome outside Pristina, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official highly assessed the troops' performance, who "
covered 500 kilometers in seven and a half hours" while moving
from Bosnia to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian-U.S. talks on Russia's peacekeeping role in
Kosovo, which lasted until 06:00 (0200 GMT) Saturday, are likely
to resume here shortly, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation included Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, while the U.S. side would
include Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Pentagon
representatives.
</P>
<P>
"There is an understanding that the talks will continue today,"
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that Ivanov's planned trip to Kaliningrad and
visits to Latvia and Lithuania were postponed "in connection with
the events" around Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Russia Kosovo Move Not Independent Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Defense Ministry has
denied acting independently in the deployment of Russian
paratroopers in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It was not an independent action on the part of the military
leadership," The Interfax news agency quoted Defense Ministry
representatives as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more Russian troops would be flown to the
aerodrome outside Pristina if "a political decision to this effect
it made," the representatives said.
</P>
<P>
Interfax, in an earlier report, said movement of Russian troops
into Kosovo was coordinated "at the top level" in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
These actions were "strictly regulated by a plan" which
envisioned various options with regard to changes in the situation,
Interfax said, quoting informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said earlier that the
entry into Kosovo of the Russian troops was unfortunate and that
orders were given for them to pull out.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told the Cable News Network that the appearance in
Pristina of Russian military personnel unfortunately did take
place, while the reasons for this are being determined.
</P>
<P>
"They have been ordered to leave Kosovo immediately and to
await further orders," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian officers said that no orders have been issued
for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Pristina, capital of
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.

<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In Europe, 300 million voters have begun voting to elect
deputies of the European Parliament. The complicated mechanism of
the European institutions, which are familiar to the Germans
accustomed to federalism, are not understandable to the French,
who can turn out on Sunday with a great abstention.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the efforts by NATO to limit the role of Russia in
Kosovo, the Russians succeeded in mixing up the plan of NATO on
Friday. While the British and French contingents were ready to
enter Kosovo at dawn Saturday, they were over-taken in speed by a
column of 500 Russian parachutists from Bosnia who created
surprise and confusion by reaching Kosovo first.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Russians hit a great blow on Friday by getting into
Kosovo before NATO. Russia has refused to play a walk-on part in
the Kosovo Force under the command of the United States and want
to have its own zone of administration. But the lack of financial
means could force Russia to accept a compromise.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union will elect on Sunday its parliament. The
voting has already begun in four countries and it was marked by
great abstention rates -- 51 percent in Denmark, 56 percent in
Ireland and 70 percent in Britain and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Hold FM Level Talks Over Kashmir Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan Saturday held
foreign minister level talks here over the Kashmir crisis with
India asking Pakistan to "vacate armed intrusion".
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and his
Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz began their two-and-a-half hour
talks soon after the latter arrived here from Islamabad to defuse
tension due to new crisis arising from Kargil sector of Kashmir
along the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
India asserted that "Pakistan-backed infiltrators" intruded its
territory in Kargil mountainous area and it launched a big
military operation to "flush out all the infiltrators" from mid
May. This Army-Air Force combined operation is still going on.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Jaswant Singh told Aziz that defusion of
crisis in Kargil would be possible only by restoration of status
quo ante along the LOC without further loss of time, official
sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The LOC is well-defined and well-delineated on authentic maps
signed by military authorities of both countries. Its location has
been known for 28 years," Singh said.
</P>
<P>
India had made efforts to work for the establishment of peace
and good neighborly relations with Pakistan and the inauguration
of the Delhi-Lahore bus service in February this year was a
testimony to the larger vision of India, he further said in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the talks, Pakistan Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz said, "It is too early to make a statement. It is in transit.
Our dialogue has just started."
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the talks were held in a "serious
and business-like atmosphere." The two sides later had a working
lunch together.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli officer was wounded
overnight in south Lebanon in an ambush orchestrated by
Iranian-baked Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Clash erupted in the Ibu Kab hill inside the Israeli occupied
zone in south Lebanon after an Israeli patrol were ambushed, the
Voice of the People radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army in Jerusalem confirmed the clash, saying the
injured officer has been transported by a helicopter to Israel for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
It added that Hezbollah guerrillas were also wounded in the
clash, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
This is the second ambush that Israeli forces encountered in
the past two days in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, an Israeli officer was killed and four
others wounded in a fire-exchange with Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The lastest fatality raised to 10 the number of the Israeli
servicemen killed in south Lebanon since the start of this
year. Another 28 soldiers were wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust the Israeli occupation troops and their proxy South Lebanon
Army militia out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Got 650 Mln US Dollar Foreign Aids for Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 26 billion pesos (650 million
U.S. dollars) in development funds from abroad have been pumped
into Philippines' land reform and rural development projects, the
country's Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) said Saturday in a
report.
</P>
<P>
DAR's report said that more than a dozen international
institutions and foreign governments have poured the money into
agrarian reform communities (ARCs) developed by the
farmer-beneficiaries of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program
(CARP), which Philippine President Joseph Estrada wants to be
completed during his administration.
</P>
<P>
The money donors include the Asian Development Bank, the
European Union, the United Nations Development Program and the
governments of Belgium, Japan, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier directed DAR Secretary Horacio Morales to
expedite the distribution of the remaining 1.3 million hectares of
CARP-covered land so his administration can wrap up this
decade-old program before he steps aside in the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this 2004 target, Morales earlier said President
Estrada will ask Congress to set aside 6 billion pesos (150
million U.S. dollars) yearly over the next five years, or a total
of 30 billion pesos (750 million U.S. dollars), for CARP.
</P>
<P>
The ARC is a cluster of villages covered by lands distributed
under CARP that receive government services such as roads,
irrigation facilities, marketing assistance and education.
</P>
<P>
Agrarian reform is one of the foundations of the Estrada
administration's commitment to food security, poverty reduction
and countryside development.

paratroopers, have been ready for departure for Yugoslavia, the
Interfax reported Saturday, quoting military sources.
</P>
<P>
It said IL-76 military transportation aircraft were prepared
for the reinforcement at Ivanovo, Ryazan and Pskov aerodromes.
</P>
<P>
"Crews were transferred to the regime of four-hour readiness
for take-off, and aircraft technicians do not leave aerodromes,"
the military sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian officers said that no orders have been
issued for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Pristina, capital
of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, as Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov had said before.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the Russian contingent in Yugoslavia is likely to be
reinforced in the near future, Interfax reported, quoting a high-
ranking military official.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 paratroopers and 40 armored vehicles and tanks,
which arrived in Pristina at 04:30 a.m. Moscow time (0030 GMT),
are being placed at the Slitic aerodrome, the official said.
</P>
<P>

necessary measure," he said. Fighter jets and transportation
aircraft can land at the aerodrome outside Pristina, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official highly assessed the troops' performance, who "
covered 500 kilometers in seven and a half hours" while moving
from Bosnia to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian-U.S. talks on Russia's peacekeeping role in
Kosovo, which lasted until 06:00 (0200 GMT) Saturday, are likely
to resume here shortly, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation included Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, while the U.S. side would
include Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Pentagon
representatives.
</P>
<P>
"There is an understanding that the talks will continue today,"
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that Ivanov's planned trip to Kaliningrad and
visits to Latvia and Lithuania were postponed "in connection with
the events" around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who came to the Kremlin
Saturday for ceremonies marking the Independence, is to meet
Defense Minister Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Ivanov, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
There were reports earlier that Yeltsin had already met with

HANGZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
plans to invest 2.4 billion yuan on more than 50 technology
upgrading projects for its local pharmaceutical industry this year,
in an attempt to boost the sector overall.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang now has 20 hi-tech pharmaceutical enterprises, which
contribute more than half of the profits earned by industry
generally in the region.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of the local pharmaceutical enterprises,
totaling over 40, have also set up their own development
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province listed an additional 19 state level and
20 plus province level technology-upgrading projects in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, it has also been developing more than 30 new
medicines in four categories annually, instead of relying on
imported technology.
</P>
<P>
The use of bio-technology, especially in the development of
medicines using extractions from marine animals and plants, has
become a new economy boosting factor for the local pharmaceutical
industry.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Speaker Anger at U.S. Embassy Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Parliament Speaker
Spyros Kyprianou has urged the government to issue a reprimand to
the U.S. embassy in Nicosia over its statement against two Cypriot
parties, local media reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the U.S. embassy in a statement has
criticized the left-wing AKEL party and the center-right
Democratic Party DIKO for not accepting invitations to the
U.S. embassy-sponsored events in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "our impression is that AKEL and DIKO
members have only come to the embassy recently to demonstrate
against NATO's efforts to stop the Serbian regime's criminal
actions in kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement, Kyprianou said Friday that he
might ask for a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador and also called
on the government to intervene.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot allow interference in the democratic
political life of a country and to allow a foreign country to
define what the political leadership should do," Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
AKEL Parliamentary Spokesman Andreas Christou has also stated
that he expects that diplomatic missions in Cyprus should respect
political parties and leaders.
</P>
<P>
He rejected claims that AKEL members intentionally refused to
attend U.S. embassy functions.
</P>
<P>
"However, relations with foreign missions could not remain
unaffected when some of those countries bomb a country friendly
to the people of Cyprus," Christou added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile leader of ruling right-wing Democratic Rally Party,
Nicos Anastasiades, when invited to comment on the U.S. stance
towards AKEL and DIKO, said if that was true "I strongly denounce
it".
</P>
<P>
He said political parties have the right of their opinions and
are not "answerable to any embassy".

HANOI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's National Assembly showed
its resolve to continue implementing the Vietnamese government's
socio-economic targets and the 1999 state budget passed at the
fourth session of the 10th National Assembly in October 1998, said
Chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly Nong Duc Manh.
</P>
<P>
Manh made the remarks in his closing speech at the fifth
session of the 10th National Assembly which closed here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Manh said that Vietnam's economy continued to achieve a
positive growth rate so far this year with the country's gross
domestic products growing at about 4 percent in the first quarter
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Vietnam's socio-economic development over the
recent months has shown weak points.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to take measures to boost investments in
development projects, encourage people to actively buy state bonds
to increase development investments," the National Assembly
chairman stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called for raising industrial production, improving the
investment environment, facilitating production and consumption,
expanding both domestic and overseas markets and intensifying the
fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
During the session, which began on May 4, 1999, the National
Assembly passed the Enterprise Law, the Press Law and the Vietnam
Fatherland Front Law.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here Saturday to embark on the Algeria and Morocco tour to
discuss with leaders of the two countries bilateral ties and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Algiers, the first in five years, Mubarak
is expected to meet with his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz
Bouteflika on regional issues and bilateral ties, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing two-day visit to Morocco, Mubarak and Moroccan
King Hassan II will co-chair the third session of the
Egyptian-Moroccan Higher Committee, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The committee meetings are designed to tackle a report by the
Egyptian-Moroccan Business Council about proposals on setting up
joint ventures and upgrading trade volume, which stood at 33
million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
MENA reported that nine agreements will be signed between the
two countries, enhancing cooperation in crime fighting, industry,
oil, air transport, farming, health and animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Mubarak may mediate between the two North
African Arab neighbors of Algeria and Morocco in a bid to seek
solutions to their disputes over the West Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Algiers and Rabat have long been at odds over the West Sahara.
Algeria was opposed to Morocco's occupation of West Sahara's
northern part following Spain's withdrawal in 1975. It recognized
the Arab Sahara Democratic Republic founded by the local West
Sahara People's Liberation Front in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak mediated between the two sides in 1977 as he was
Egypt's deputy president.
</P>
<P>
The visits, which was originally planned to start on Tuesday,
were delayed after the president suffered a stomach upset.

<P>
BLACE BORDER CROSSING, Macedonia, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The first
batch of NATO troops rolled into Kosovo from this border crossing
between Macedonia and Yugoslavia early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the 200 troops, mostly from the Parachute
Regiment of the British Fifth Airborne Brigade, drove through the
border post at 05:23 local time (0323 GMT). Dozens of helicopters
were seen heading toward the southern Serbian province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Blace border crossing is about 19 kilometers from Skopje,
the capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Adrian Freer, who was sitting in the first vehicle in
the convoy, told reporters that the helicopters would airlift 1,
600 engineering soldiers whose job is to make safe the road to
Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo, by removing
demolitions and demining.
</P>
<P>
In the first 24-kilometer section of the road there are two
tunnels and eight bridges, where some demolitions and mines might
need to be removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old British officer said there would be no ceremony
at the border crossing for it is "not a sort of victory or triumph.
"
</P>
<P>
For the day, around 6,000 NATO troops are scheduled to be moved
into Kosovo, according to the British military officer.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 16,000 NATO troops are stationed in
Macedonia and another 14,000 soldiers started arriving recently.
</P>
<P>
NATO has a plan to deploy some 48,000 soldiers in Kosovo to
form the Kosovo Force, or K-FOR, of which 7,000 troops will come
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Around 13,000 British troops are arriving in the Balkans and
another 6,000 are on stand-by, making it the largest single
contingent in the K-FOR. Germany, which is providing a quarter of
all NATO troops in Macedonia and Albania, will be sending 8,000
troops into the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
France and Italy are reportedly ready to contribute 7,000 and 5,
000 soldiers respectively.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 48,000 NATO troops will enter Kosovo
through Macedonia because there is a good highway linking Skopje
and Pristina.

<P>
Resource mobilization through broadening of tax base, reduction

<P>
The PML government also projects the net capital receipts for

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Tire Firms to Fight Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Three major tire companies
operating in Tanzania have joined forces to fight the smuggling of
tires of inferior quality into the country and black markets of
the goods.
</P>
<P>
The companies, General Tire East African Ltd, Bridgestone and
Michelin, met their dealers Thursday in Dar es Salaam, to plan
strategies for controlling smugglers of second-hand and low
quality tires, newspapers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The General Manager of General Tire East African Limited,
Patrick Grisworld, said that the companies have decided to form an
association to fight the smuggling activities that not only affect
their production but also cause environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Grisworld said that as they have invested a lot of money to
build factories and to train their workers in the business in
order to produce high quality goods, other companies should follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
Facing competition from smugglers, good quality tires of the
three companies have stockpiled, he said, adding that employees
might be forced to lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Tanzanian authorities imposed a ban on the
imports of second-handed tires.
</P>
<P>
Grisworld said the three companies fully supported the
government's move to ban the imports of second-hand tires. He also
called on the government to take measures against dumping of
unwanted goods by foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Commander: No Orders to Send More Russian Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian airborne troops have not
received any command to send an additional peacekeeping contingent
to Kosovo, troops commander Colonel-General Georgy Shpak said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shpak did not say whether Russian paratroopers from the Bosnia
Stabilization Force who entered Kosovo early Saturday could be
returned, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said earlier that the
entry into Kosovo of the Russian troops was unfortunate and that
orders were given for them to pull out.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told the Cable News Network that the appearance in
Pristina of Russian military personnel unfortunately did take
place, while the reasons for this are being determined. Otherwise,
they have been ordered to leave Kosovo immediately and to await
further orders.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry had made the decision to send its
troops ahead of NATO peacekeepers. It said the move had been
coordinated with the Yugoslav army supreme command, reported the
Itar-Tass news agency from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military move into Pristina, the capital of Kosovo,
followed Russian diplomats' insistence Friday that Russian troops
and their NATO counterparts should enter Kosovo at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, talks here on Russian troops' peacekeeping role in
Kosovo between Russia and the United States, which stretched into
the early hours of Saturday, are scheduled to resume shortly.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, had
said late Friday that the talks were "complicated," but neither
Russian nor US spokesmen would comment further.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott had rushed back
to Moscow on Friday, having left earlier in the day for NATO
headquarters in Brussels. He returned after hearing that a convoy
of troops and vehicles from the Russian peacekeeping contingent in
Bosnia had crossed into Yugoslavia and was heading toward Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been insisting all along that it be given control
over its own peacekeeping sector in Kosovo, and that its troops
not be placed under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not take part ... with a second-rate standing,"
Ivanov said Friday in an interview with Russian state television.
</P>
<P>
It will participate only under conditions that correspond to
Russia's interests, that respect Russia's rights and that answer
the tasks that have been set, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Leonid Ivashov, director of the Russian Defense Ministry's
Department for International Military Cooperation, said Moscow is
planning to deploy its troops in the northern districts of Kosovo,
which are densely populated by the Serbs, who have warm feelings
toward the Russians.

Albert of the Principality of Monaco today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hard Talks Expected for Indo-Pak Foreign Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz began talks here
as soon as the latter arrived here by a special plane from
Islamabad over the Kargil crisis of Kashmir and their talks are
expected to be hard as both sides stand far apart.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here Friday, Jaswant Singh said that if
Islamabad was serious about defusing tension, it had the very
simple option of restoring status quo ante and accounting for the
"barbarism" inflicted on Indian uniformed men. India said that six
bodies of Indian soldiers returned by Pakistan were mutilated.
</P>
<P>
Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee also
asserted on Friday that the Line of Control was not negotiable
saying that Islamabad's "armed intrusion" in Kashmir would be the
only agenda of Saturday's talks between Singh and Aziz.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Indian government Friday released
transcripts of telephone conversations between two top Pakistan
generals on May 26 and 29 to show that the "Pakistan Army was the
initiator and principal actor" behind the Kargil crisis.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from Islamabad airport, Aziz accused India
of over-reacting to events in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Our interpretation is that India totally over-reacted to the
situation in a disproportionate way," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were clashes along the Line of Control for many years as
mountain snows melt in Kashmir, but "this time India reacted with
large-scale mobilization of its troops, aircraft, heavy artillery
and gunship helicopters," he further said.
</P>
<P>
India launched a big combined military operation in mid May in
Kargil sector of Kashmir to "flush out all Pakistan-backed
infiltrators" in the area and since then exchanges of fire have
also increased along the Line of Control in Kashmir between India
and Pakistan.

NANJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in east China
's Jiangsu Province handled 31.9 billion yuan worth of exports
during the first four months of the year, a 0.23 percent rise on a

</P>
<P>
Suzhou maintains its position as the largest contributor to the
exports, with the local township enterprises bringing in 22
percent of the total volume.
</P>

The exports of hi-tech products like electronic-machinery and
chemical items are on a big rise, against the decrease of exports
of textile products locally.

<HEADLINE> Maize Production Estimates Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Lack of rain in most parts of
Kenya is causing concern, with the country's Ministry of
Agriculture revising downwards its maize production estimates.
</P>
<P>
The most pronounced revision has been undertaken in Eastern and
 Central provinces, where it is estimated that less than 40
percent of the targeted maize production will be harvested, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the national level, the Ministry of Agriculture has
projected that an estimated 2.02 million tons of maize will be
harvested during the 1999 long rains, compared with 2.31 million
tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of maize production is mainly attributed to the
poor and sparse distribution of rainfall. Other causes include
scarcity of key inputs such as maize seed and fertilizer,
increased prices of agricultural inputs and crop damaged by army
worms.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Department, the
lower-than-expected long rains had resulted in depressed
vegetation conditions in the eastern part of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
However, the department said western Kenya and parts of the
Rift Valley were set to receive reasonable rains this season,
enough to sustain a successful crop production, adding the
western part would have 75 percent of normal to above-normal
rainfall between June and August.

<HEADLINE> Fishery Export Earnings Increase in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The export earnings of the
Bangladesh's fisheries sector will be 15.52 billion taka (about
320 million U.S. dollars) in the current July 1998-June 1999
fiscal year against 13.1 billion taka (about 270 million dollars)
in the previous fiscal year, according to the Bangladesh Economic
Survey 1999 available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The production in fisheries sector rose to 1.49 million tons in
the 1997-98 fiscal year from 1.31 million tons in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries sector's export earnings account for 3.4 percent
of the national export earnings and 10.9 percent of the
agriculture sector earnings, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
Viewing the fisheries as a prospective sector for meeting the
demand of protein, alleviating poverty and earning foreign
exchange, the government adopted the national fisheries policy
last year, and is continuing its programs for increasing
infrastructure facilities in fisheries sector and for research
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries hatcheries are being set up at public and private
levels in a bid to increase the fish production. And now there are
141 government hatcheries and 631 private ones in the country, the
survey states.
</P>
<P>
Livestock is another prospective sector for increasing the
national economic growth and for poverty alleviation, and
contribution of the sector to the gross domestic product is 3.3
percent and to agriculture sector is 10.6 percent, and the
production of this sector is also increasing at public and private
levels. In the 1990-91 fiscal year, the growth rate in this sector
was only 2.3 percent while in the 1998-99 fiscal year, it
increased to 7.6 percent, it says.
</P>
<P>
Besides, meat and milk productions in 1991-92 fiscal year were
0.46 million tons and 1.352 million tons respectively, but in the
1998-99 fiscal year those are projected to be 0.62 million tons
and 1.68 million tons respectively, it adds.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Witnesses Rapid Growth in Economy by Feng Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Since Uganda launched radical
economic reforms over one decade ago, its economy has fully
recovered from previous damages caused by civil strife and
political instability by recording a rare growth rate in Africa
and even in the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, Uganda's economy has grown by six
percent and when reading the 1999/2000 budget to Parliament
Thursday afternoon, Finance Minister Gerald Ssendaula told the MPs
that the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to
grow by 7.8 percent in the current fiscal year ending this June.
</P>
<P>
Although the National Resistance Movement inherited in January
1986 an economy characterized by severe macro-economic
disequilibria, it launched the famous Economic Recovery Program in
1987 whose broad aspects were financial stabilization, structural
adjustment and economic transformation.
</P>
<P>
These reforms have yielded fruits. By the year 1998, a total
of 296 projects had been licensed with planned investment of 1.566
billion U.S. dollars, providing 18,765 jobs.
</P>
<P>
As a result of industrial development, the share of agriculture
in the GDP had declined from 57 percent in 1987 to 42.5 percent in
1997. Non- coffee export earnings had soared up from 31.9 million
dollars to 293.9 million dollars over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collections, the main source of government revenue,
increased from 110 million dollars in 1992 to about 700 million
dollars in 1997 while foreign exchange inflows consisting of
direct investment, private transfers and export earnings had shot
up to 1,151 million dollars from 174 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following the Civil Service Reform program, the number of civil
servants had been slashed from 320,000 in 1991 to 157,000 in 1997.
Their salaries had increased from 2.7 percent of the GDP to 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the current financial year, Uganda's GDP is expected to grow
by 7.8 percent. This is more than twice as fast as the average for
all developing countries, which is estimated by the International
Monetary Fund at only 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ssendaula said this economic growth in the current fiscal year
was led by agriculture and manufacturing. Agricultural
production, the main-stay of economy, bounced back very strongly
after two consecutive years in which production was hit by the El
Nino weather pattern and a severe drought. Production of cash and
food crops rose by 14 percent and 10 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the manufacturing sector continued at a
vigorous pace, with output growth projected at 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, economic growth has not been confined to agriculture
and manufacturing. It has been broadly based, with most of the
major sectors of the economy achieving real growth rates exceeding
five percent in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector expanded output at a rate of eight
percent, the wholesale and retail trade at nine percent, the
transport and communications sector at seven percent, and
electricity and water at five percent.
</P>
<P>
Faced with new challenges like volatile exchange rate, bank
closures and increased insecurity, the Ugandan government has
decided to put most of its energy on economic construction as
indicated in the new budget.
</P>
<P>
According to the new budget, the government lists education,
improvement of infrastructure and poverty eradication as its the
priorities.
</P>
<P>
Budget for education has increased from 246 billion shillings
(170 million dollars) for the current fiscal year's to 340 billion
shillings (240 million dollars). Road building will be 105.59
billion shillings (80 million dollars), an increase of 50 percent.
The poverty action fund will be up by 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
With improvement of infrastructure, increase of home-stead
incomes and reduction of illiteracy rate, Uganda's economy will
usher in a new era of unprecedented growth.

<HEADLINE> Victorious Chinese Footballers Still Have Much to Prove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- They chalked up nine goals and
allowed none in three games, but the Chinese Olympic side still
have much to prove as the Asian Group 7 second leg qualifiers for
the 2000 Olympics kick off here today.
</P>
<P>
China, whose crushing 4-0 double victories over Vietnam and
Myanmar combined with 1-0 win from DPR Korea in their first leg
matches in Hanoi two weeks ago drove them all but into the next
round knock-out competition, found it difficult to please the
domestic media.
</P>
<P>
Needing more than 40 minutes to open the account in their first
two matches, Englishman Bobby Houghton's army were widely
criticized for their laborious way of victory over minnow rivals.
</P>
<P>
A physically superior Chinese eleven seemed to bully their tiny
Southeast Asian opponents into defeat rather than roundly beat
them with more efficient attacking tactics.
</P>
<P>
"Victories that could cheer nobody up," the mass circulation
Sports Weekly declared in their headline. "What kind of sides and
in what kind of ways we won ? Such victories proved nothing."
</P>
<P>
China's lackluster win over DPR Korea in their last group match
in Hanoi seemed nothing short of a loss in the scrutinizing eyes
of the Chinese newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A defensively-minded Houghton came under heavy fire after China
only deprived one goal of a DPR Korean side who played with 10 men
most of the time.
</P>
<P>
A DPR Korean coach emerged from the match claiming runaway
favorites China were nothing special and didn't deserve fear.
</P>
<P>
"Before the match our players were scared to play the Chinese.
Now we regain our confidence. They are no better than us, and you
can expect a close battle next time we meet," he said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
China's incapability to unleash enough arsenal to penetrate the
always thick defensive walls came down to one point: lack of the
attacking midfielder.
</P>
<P>
Houghton fell deaf on media's calls for Zhang Xiaorui, the
stylish midfielder who had learned his trades in Brazil for five
years and said adding an attacking-obsessed Zhang would destroy
the balance of his midfield.
</P>
<P>
Defender Sun Jihai, who played for English first division side
Crystal Palace, would provide more attacking weaponry with his
explosive runs on the flank, but Houghton preferred him to act as
center back instead of his more familiar role of left back.
</P>
<P>
Whatever on his mind, Houghton'd better remember the home crowd
are expecting a slaughter this time around and nothing short of
nine goals would satisfy their ferocious appetite.

The GCC states, which include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, currently levy
customs duties as high as 80 percent on tobacco products. And they
plan to raise the rate to 100 percent by the year 2000 in line
with their 1983 agreement to unify custom tariffs.

<P>
Importing nearly 30 billion cigarettes a year, worth over 800
million U.S. dollars, GCC countries' revenues from tobacco duties
are likely to exceed 1 billion dollars by next year.

<HEADLINE> UAE Music Piracy Level Lowest in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has the lowest music piracy level in the Middle East following a
continuous crackdown against counterfeiters in the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest report published by the London-based International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry has said that piracy
across the Middle East is over 20 percent, and much higher in many
cases.
</P>
<P>
"The exception is the UAE, where sustained anti-piracy
activity has brought the level down to under 10 percent," the
Dubai-based Khaleej Times quoted the report as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The "Music Piracy '98" report said that music piracy level was
10-25 percent in Qatar and 25-50 percent in the rest of Gulf
Cooperation Council countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait
and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Anti-piracy campaigners in Dubai, the second largest emirate
of the UAE, said that in the Middle East, music cassette piracy
was especially high, but audio-piracy rate had fallen
dramatically since it was brought under control in the country in
1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the federation, which represents the global
recording industry, Israel is now a major cause for concern in the
region, with a domestic piracy level of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
There is further evidence that Israel is a production center
for pirate CDs for export, it said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industry Is Gloomy Due to Decline in Purchasing Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The overall picture for Vietnam's
industry at present is gloomy mainly due to a decline in
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Vietnam News Agency on Saturday,
several Vietnam's leading industrial centers have experienced a
slow-down. While local production has posted an average growth of
4.8 percent, industrial production in Hanoi has increased by 4.7
percent and Ho Chi Minh City, 2.6 percent. Meanwhile, provinces
such as Can Tho and Khanh Hoa have showed a decline of 7.4 percent
and 14.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Topping industrial output so far this year is crude oil with
6.4 million tones, 30.6 percent higher than in the first five
months of 1998. But the sector's turnover has remained at only 70
percent of last year's figure because oil prices have dropped
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's steel industry has produced 352,000 tones of goods,
80,4 percent of last year's production in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Other industries, however, are experiencing more difficulties.
With over three million tones of coal worth 800 billion Vietnamese
dong (about 57 million u.s. dollars) sitting in stockpiles,
forcing Vietnam's coal industry to run all its mines on an
alternating schedule.
</P>
<P>
Production of cement reached four million tones in the
five-month of this year, only a 2.3 percent increase from the same
period last year, Last month its price dropped by 3-5 percent
compared to January, as a result of about one million tones being
stockpiled.
</P>
<P>
Still, the value of industrial output of the country in the
first five months of the year increased by 10.2 percent. Some
Vietnam's industries are maintaining steady production due to
stable export markets. Such as the textiles and garments, leather
and footwear industries have all kept up a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
But the target of a five percent increase in Vietnam's GDP this
year could well prove beyond reaching, unless overall Vietnam's
industrial production can be boosted soon.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's GDP Drops in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's gross domestic
product (GDP) dropped by one percent during the first quarter of
1999, the Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The BCU attributed the drop to the impact of Brazil's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Industry dropped by 6.1 percent, the most serious contraction
of this decade, mainly because of the diminishing production scale
of textile, non-metallic minerals, and machinery and equipment
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The sectors of trade, restaurants and hotels registered a fall
of 3.5 percent due to reduction of trade activities in importing
finished goods and exporting manufactures.
</P>
<P>
However, the Brazilian financial crunch had not hit all the
sectors of Uruguay in the first three months this year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and livestock activities increased by 10 percent,
with growth notably seen in the production of rice, sunflower,
cattle and dairy.
</P>
<P>
Construction increased by 12.6 percent in the first quarter,
while transportation and communications rose by 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's economic team held that the downward trend of
the economy would continue during the second quarter, but they
forecast a slight recovery in the next two quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Luis Mosca predicted that the country's GDP
will drop around two percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A one percent GDP contraction for 1999 is foreseen in the
program signed between the Uruguayan government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP increased 4.5 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Upgrade Flood Forecasting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's flood forecasting and
warning capacity will be further enhanced from next year with the
expansion of its network across the country, the Daily Star
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 75 monitoring stations covering 55
percent of the areas of the country, flashing a 48-to 72-hour
forecast on the flood situation.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring stations will be expanded to cover the entire
country, according to the new project, officials concerned were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Flood Forecasting and Warning center (FFWC) of the Water
Development Board (WDB) now gathers data from the 75 stations and
American NOAA-12 and NOAA-14 satellites, which proved highly
useful to forecast the floods in 1998, and also from India through
dedicated tele-printer circuit. The data are processed at FFWC at
WDB headquarters in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The FFWC fine-tuned its computer network to develop a model
that came very useful to monitor the fluctuations during last
year's worst flood in a century, which had continued for three
months.
</P>
<P>
The center was helped by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) in 1991-95 and Denmark to raise its capability under a
project that had run from 1995 to December 1998, and the Danish
project has been extended by another four-year period beginning
next year, they stated.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the South Asian region and along the coast of the
Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh is flood-prone country, which has
experienced several severe floods since its independence in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Leaves for New Delhi to Defuse Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz left here for New Delhi on Saturday morning in a bid
to de-escalate the "dangerous situation" along the Line of Control
(LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who just returned late Friday night after a one-day visit
to China during which he briefed the Chinese leadership on the
current LoC situation, said before his departure that his basic
purpose of his visit to India is to defuse the tension.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, he
will explore means to de-escalate the tension, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have their own interpretations of the prevalent
situation on the LoC," the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
The visit is taking place at the initiative of Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif who had offered to his Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee two weeks ago to send Aziz to New Delhi for
talks on LoC situation.
</P>
<P>
India earlier had refused to accept June 7 as the date of
Aziz's visit to Delhi, saying it was "not convenient". However,
later India said it would welcome Aziz to New Delhi on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Aziz welcomed Vajpayee's statement on Wednesday, describing it
as "very positive".
</P>
<P>
"The Pakistani foreign minister is coming here. We hope that
the discussions with him will be successful and a satisfactory
solution will be found to the problem," Vajpayee was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Fogs Surrounding Indonesian Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The results of the June 7 general
election in Indonesia are surrounded by foggy predictions of the
parliament seats because of the using of different systems.
</P>
<P>
The new adapted semi proportional and district system hasn't
been well socialized yet. This system is much more complex as
compared with the previously known proportional system, only a few
people understand how the system really works.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the system set a totally complex
procedure to determine the outcome of the ballots counting
process.
</P>
<P>
For Jakarta and Yogyakarta special provinces, the outcome of
the ballots counting can easily determined the seats earned by
each of the contesting parties. Seats will be distributed to all
parties according to the percentage of the total votes they
gained.
</P>
<P>
But the remaining 25 provinces will contribute seats according
to each party's performance in the district level.
</P>
<P>
Totally, there are 68,000 villages, 4,000 districts, 327
regencies and 27 provinces in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
People are widely advised to wait for the result patiently
since the district seats result calculation can only begin after
the first step (in sub-districts) which has not yet completed. In
the district level, seats distribution will be based on the votes
each party got in each district, that means winning in national
votes counting result gives no guarantee to obtaining the most
seats.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Election Commission, as of 08:00 a.m.
local time on Saturday only more than 20 percent of the election
results have been released. The Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) maintained its lead among five major parties with
7,858,091 votes, followed by the National Awakening Party (PKB)
with 4,065,332, the ruling Golkar Party with 3,314,576, the United
Development Party (PPP) with 1,933,835 and the National Mandate
Party (PAN) with 1,402,499.
</P>
<P>
About 100 million voters from 27 provinces all over the country
cast their ballots on June 7 at 320,000 polling stations to elect
462 parliament members. The polls were conducted smoothly and
peacefully in general.
</P>
<P>
The General Election Commission is counting the results of the
polls, which is expected to be finished on June 21. But some
parties and political observers have criticized the slow vote
counting process, saying it could open loopholes for vote-rigging.
</P>
<P>
The newly elected parliament members plus 38 appointed
representatives from the military as well as 200
president-appointed members come from regional and functional
groups will form the 700-seat People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR will elect a new president and vice president in
November this year.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Ancient Porcelain in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on
ceramic arts of the 1,400-year old Yaozhou Kiln has been held in
Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 domestic and overseas scholars and experts
attended the three day seminar and discussed the history,
development, techniques and artwork of the products.
</P>
<P>
The Yaozhou Kiln was built in the sixth century in the Tang
Dynasty (618-907). As one of the most famous kilns in north China,
the Yaozhou Kiln experienced its prosperous time over the
following 700 years in the Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties (907-960),
Song Dynasty (960-1279), Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), Yuan Dynasty (
1271-1368) and Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Chen Shuangquan, mayor of Tongchuan City, said that Chinese
archaeologists have discovered vast quantities of porcelain items
from the kiln over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Lili, a Shanghai based archaeologist said that most of
them are in the famous gray-green glaze style and the kiln was the
country's most prestigious for its techniques in creating such
products in the Song Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
"The kiln craftsmen developed over 100 decoration patterns on
porcelain articles at the time," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
The kiln played an important role in the country's development
of porcelain production and the relics discovered from the kiln
will provide valuable clues for study on the comparisons between
ancient Chinese kiln techniques and modern porcelain producing
technology.

<HEADLINE> Thai Food Ban Widened to France, the Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Meat, poultry, egg and dairy
products from France and the Netherlands will be removed from
supermarket shelves in Thailand from Monday when an extended food
ban takes effect.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Public Health Ministry has banned the
imports of meat, poultry, egg and dairy products from Belgium
after the discovery of cancer-causing dioxin in animal feed.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Saturday said that there were seven importers
of French poultry and 34 importers of dairy products from France
and two importers of Belgian pork in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the companies would be called to a meeting
with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials after which
they must recalled the food from all shelves within three to five
days.
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said that traders of Belgian meat, dairy products
and chocolates had been very cooperative with authorities in
making sure that the products were not put on sale.
</P>
<P>
They expected similar cooperation from traders of food products
from France and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Efforts to Protect Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has launched a plan to
protect its rapidly-dwindling tiger population.
</P>
<P>
About 200 of these endangered big cats currently survive in
Vietnam's mountains and forests, according to a report of
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's experts attribute their thinning ranks to poor
ecological conditions and illegal poaching.
</P>
<P>
Most of Vietnam's tigers are of the Indochinese species and
live in provinces of Lai Chau, Quang Binh, Kon Tum and Quang Nam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese scientists are first assessing the tigers' present
conditions, and will then select areas to establish preservation
zones.
</P>
<P>
Under Vietnam's new plan, measures will be implemented to both
curb poaching and to stop the illegal trade of tigers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam has established a nature reserve in Kon Tum
province as a tiger preservation area.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Dutch Government financed the project
with 12.8 million u.s. dollars, which includes funding for the
planting of 20,000 ha of forests in the surrounding area,
according to the Vietnam News.

<HEADLINE> China Treasures Relations With Central Asian Countries: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TASHKENT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier
Qian Qichen said here Friday that China treasures, and is
satisfied with, its current relations with Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Qian said that there were no
political obstacles between China and Uzbekistan in their efforts
to strengthen their cooperation in all fields. Only the
inconvenience in communications and transportation between them
may constitute impediment to development.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chinese government encourages Chinese companies
to invest in the Central Asian country, which Qian hoped would in
turn further improve its own investment environment to attract
Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the purpose of his four-nation Central Asian tour was
to deepen mutual understanding between China and these countries
and to exchange views with their leaders on bilateral ties and
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan is the last stop of Qian's current Central Asian
tour which has taken him to Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kirgiz.
</P>
<P>
Qian said relations between China and these Central Asian
nations entered a new stage after they became independent
following the disintegration of the former Soviet Union in 1991,
and cooperation between China and them has been smooth since then.
</P>
<P>
He noted China and Central Asian countries are strengthening
cooperation in road and railway transportation in order to revive
the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chinese government supports the initiative of
establishing a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia since China
believes that any country has the right to put forward reasonable
proposals for peace and stability in the region where it is
located.
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Qian also reiterated China's stance on
the Kosovo crisis, saying that only on the basis of respecting
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and guaranteeing the legal rights of all
ethnic groups in the region could the issue be solved through a
political solution.
</P>
<P>
The use of force can only serve to worsen and complicate the
issue, rather than help settle the issues of human rights,
humanity and refugees, and ease ethnic tension in the region, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China emphasized that the precondition of
settling the Kosovo issue was the immediate halt of NATO's bombing
of Yugoslavia and the return to the course of political solution.
</P>
<P>
China believed that it was unfair that the 79-day bombing of
Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO was not even mentioned in the U.N.
resolution on Kosovo, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China did not obstruct the passage of the resolution in the
United Nations, he said, but China could not vote for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's Public Health
Ministry on Friday imposed a ban on import of 1,500 kinds of food
products from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Raul Bustos asked Uruguayans to examine the
origin of any food product before acquiring it. Retailers were
ordered to withdraw from their shelves all food commodities
originating from Belgian.
</P>
<P>
The Livestock, Agriculture, and Fishing Ministry (MGAP)

Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Food products in Belgium have been found contaminated with
dioxin, a highly carcinogenic substance.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Argentina as well as Uruguay, a major consumer of
Belgian dehydrated eggs and chocolate, also stopped importing and
marketing basic staples from Belgium.

WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on

<HEADLINE> Mexico Expects More Income From Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico could receive an extra
amount of more than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars this year from the
latest oil price recovery in the world markets, according to Grupo
Financiero Bancomer estimates.
</P>
<P>
The recent rises in the prices of the Mexican crude, after the
production cuts agreed on by several countries in The Hague, could
increase Mexico's oil income up to 1.36 billion dollars, said the
group in an analysis for the month of May.
</P>
<P>
But the analysis said the prospect of a high oil price
quotation in the long term is uncertain, even if the recovery "is
an obvious reaction to an outlook of a minor supply."
</P>
<P>
The analysis shows that Mexico could obtain additional income
for 1.36 billion dollars with an average price of 12.25 dollars,
above the government forecast of 9.25 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of the international oil prices, according to the
financial group, would be linked to the fulfillment of the last
commitments signed by the producing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the group said that the long term outlook is not very
favorable for the exporters, because the oil market has a trend to
behave in a manner similar to the markets of other raw materials,
where the producers do not have much influence on the prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile's fishing exports in the
first four month this year went down by 13.9 percent in tonnage
from the same period of 1998, the Fishing Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's fishing exports in the period dropped to 352,387
tons, but the value of the exports, amounting to 647.7 million U.S.
dollars, was similar to that of the January-April period of last
year, thanks to a recovery of 16.2 percent in the average price.
</P>
<P>
The biggest income for the period came from frozen products.
Earnings from these grew by 23.5 percent, amounting to 359.3
million dollars, although their volume dropped by 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan continued to be the main market for Chile's frozen
products, accounting for 73 percent of the total exports. The
other major markets were the United States, Spain, France and
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Mexican Stock Market Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Mexico's
stock market in May dropped from 52.373 billion U.S. dollars to 50.
228 billion, down by 4.10 percent from April, the Mexico Stock
Exchange (BMV) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total foreign investment last month, 1.977 billion
dollars went to the money market, 12.51 percent less than the
figure in April, the BMV said.
</P>
<P>
And 48.251 billion dollars were earmarked to the variable
income market, 3.72 percent down from April.
</P>
<P>
But the BMV said the total foreign capital invested in the
country between May 31 and December 31 of 1998 showed a 43.70-
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that a U.S. rate rise could weaken the
floating peso, the Mexican currency, and attract more foreign
investments away from the country's market.
</P>
<P>
So they warned that with a floating currency and 90 percent of
its exports going to the United States, Mexico has no room for
complacency in this respect.

They have been assigned to the United States, Britain, Germany,
France and Italy while Russian troops would be in one of those
sectors, and not have their own.

Russia wants to have its own sector and its troops not to be

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details Ivanov Says Russian Troop Enter A Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said the Russian troops' entering in Kosovo capital
Pristina early Saturday was "an unfortunate mistake" and the
troops have been ordered to leave "immediately."
</P>
<P>
Reading a statement through an interpreter on the Cable News
Network (CNN), Ivanov said the Russian government did not know who
gave the order to enter Pristina and would investigate the event.
</P>
<P>
A CNN report said U.S. White House officials were satisfied
with the explanation for now and were waiting for a more detailed
one.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade cheered to several hundred Russian soldiers, aboard
trucks and troop transports, who made a surprise arrival in
Pristina shortly before 1:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
The Russian column was the first foreign troops to enter Kosovo
officially after NATO ended its 11-week air war against Yugoslavia.
NATO's own troops were waiting in Macedonia on Kosovo's southern
border to enter on Saturday as part of an international
peacekeeping force authorized by the United Nations.

OTTAWA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada is sending another column of
500 troops to Kosovo, bringing the total number of the Canadian
contingent to approximately 1,300, Defense Minister Art Eggleton
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
This does not include some 300 military personnel who were

The new contingent, which will arrive within 60 days, could
include up to six tanks to be used in clearing land mines.
</P>
<P>
Most of the additional troops will come from the First
Battalion of the Princes Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry based

Eggleton estimated the cost would be around 200 million
Canadian dollars (about 136 million U.S. dollars) over 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Complete "School for All" Project </HEADLINE>

<P>
SOFIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will complete by the end of
this year the "School for All" project launched last October,
Deputy Minister of Education and Science Ventsislav Panchev said
at an international conference on dropout students.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, some 80,000 students out of the total 1,
100,000 have left schools before finishing their studies, Panchev
said.
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for school dropouts, among which drug
abuse is a major one, Panchev said.
</P>
<P>
Under the "School for All" project, training centers for new
teaching methods will be set up and a study will be conducted on
the exact number of the dropouts next October.
</P>
<P>
Also under the project, a poll was conducted among 1,700
dropouts, which showed that fears for exams, lack of interests and
dislike of the teachers are the most important reasons for them to
quit school. Only two percent of the polled students say they do
not have the money needed for school.

<HEADLINE> Vote-Rigging Allegations Spur Call For Repolling in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Alleged vote-rigging involving
ruling Golkar Party and government officials prompted more demands
that polls be reheld in several provinces in Indonesia, national
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far, vote counting has been painfully slow, raising fears of
fraud. Five days after Monday's ballot, only about 20 percent of
ballots have officially been recorded.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, a tense provincial elections committee meeting on
Friday concluded with an agreement to recount millions of ballots
after inconsistencies were discovered in the original count.
</P>
<P>
The demand that ballots be recounted in Jakarta came from the
representatives of 32 minor political parties on the committee.
</P>
<P>
New calls for the rejection of elections results came from
North Sulawesi and South Sulawesi. Similar calls were earlier
voiced in Southeast Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi and South
Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
In the North Sulawesi capital of Manado, 18 of the 39 political
parties who contested the elections in the province agreed on
Friday to reject the results of the polls and called for the
elections to be reheld.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement, the protesting parties also
demanded Golkar be disqualified because it bought votes and
mobilized government officials to help it win the polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, calls for the rejection of the June 7 polls in South
Sulawesi gained momentum on Friday when 46 political parties in
the province joined forces to demand the elections be reheld.
</P>
<P>
They said the polls were unfair due to intimidation and vote
buying by Golkar Party, which retained strong support from the
civil service and military in the province.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, which used its presidential nomination of B.J. Habibie
-- a South Sulawesi native -- to attract local voters, raced to a
big lead in the provisional vote tally.
</P>
<P>
Findings by independent election monitors also indicate the
Golkar Party still used bribery and intimidation to win support.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Election Monitoring Committee said it has found
evidence that Golkar conducted "dawn attacks" in Jakarta on the
morning of the June 7 election, in which the party paid needy
people to vote for Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants said they have been promised double salary every
month from April until December for promising to vote for Golkar.
But several also said they accepted the money and voted for the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P).
</P>
<P>
The official General Election Monitoring Committee (Panwaspus)
also has evidence of Golkar cheating and committing election
fraud.
</P>
<P>
The Panwaspus revealed that Golkar sent a telegram to a village
head in Hulu Sungai Utara district, Riau province, ordering that
all locals be told to vote for Golkar.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, National Elections Committee chairman Jacob Tobing
Friday said recounting the ballots would further slow the process
but it was worth any delays for the sake of credible elections.
</P>
<P>
He said voting would be repeated in a number of areas and
between 800,000 and 1 million voters, or 0.8 percent of the 117
million eligible voters, would be affected.
</P>
<P>
Repeated polls would take place between June 19 to June 27, he
said, adding that final results could still be announced by the
planned date to announce the number of votes for the House of
Representatives on July 6. The official deadline for announcing
national results is June 21.
</P>
<P>
According to data collected by Antara News Agency from all the
27 provincial and overseas chapters of the election committee
until Saturday morning, PDI-P maintained its lead with 20.5
million votes.
</P>
<P>
The number of votes gained by the PDI-P was 17.66 percent of
nearly 63 million counted votes from 116 million registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party came second with 13.5 million votes or 11.60
percent, followed by the National Awakening Party with 9.5 million
or 8.09 percent, the United Development Party 6.17 million or 5.31
percent, and the National Mandate Party 4.5 million or 3.87
percent.

<P>
TIRANA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A British C-130 military transport
jet crashed and exploded on Friday night right after taking off in
Kukes, a northern Albanian town neighboring Kosovo, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 Hercules, carrying some ammunition and 12 servicemen,
caught fire on a dirt airstrip of an airport in the town and then
exploded, with one man seriously injured, reports said.
</P>
<P>
But the others on board safely escaped before it burst into
flames.
</P>
<P>
The British aircraft, which crashed only hours before NATO's
military forces headed for Kosovo under a military agreement
reached by Yugoslav and NATO generals days ago, was believed to
have been making preparations for the alliance's troops.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Olympic Committee to Amend Constitutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- After a long five-month leadership
crisis that installed Celso Dayrit to the highest post of
Philippine Olympic Committee (POC), the Dayrit administration has
formed a committee that will review the present POC Constitutions
and By-laws for possible amendments.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit said Friday in a statement that the current POC
constitution has no specific rules in solving some problems like
the recent crisis that ended only after the International Olympic
Committee heard the voice of majority that ousted Cristy Ramos
through a confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
"The POC constitutions has become outdated and not sensitive to
the time," said Dayrit, who assigned soft tennis president Rolly
Rivera to head the committee on constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
"The committee has already started its initial studies on the
president constitution. It should be clearly stated because we
have to decide for the sports," Dayrit added.
</P>
<P>
The new POC chief also revealed that his administration is also
planning to review the respective constitutions of the National
Sports Associations accredited by the POC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dayrit reiterated that he would not allow the "have
money, will travel" scheme which Cristy Ramos implemented during
the recent 13th Asian Games in Bangkok where the Philippines
brought home only one gold medal courtesy of non-Olympic sports of
billiards.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, I'm not in favor of that scheme. It's unfair to
the other athletes who can't afford to join because they have no
money," said Dayrit.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Ivanov Says Russian Troop Enter A Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A column of Russian troops
arrived in Pristina, capital of Yugoslavia's battered Kosovo
province, early Saturday but Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said the event was "an unfortunate mistake" and the troops would
be ordered to leave "immediately."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov was speaking on the Cable News Network (CNN).
</P>
<P>
The troops, aboard trucks and troop transports, arrived in the
city shortly before 1:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Friday) to loud cheers and
fireworks from huge crowds down the main street.
</P>
<P>
The Russian column was the first foreign troops to enter Kosovo
officially after NATO ended its 11-week air war against Yugoslavia.
NATO's own troops were waiting in Macedonia on Kosovo's southern
border to enter on Saturday as part of an international
peacekeeping force authorized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Russian television reports showed footage of Russian
armored vehicles moving inside Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Five jeeps, 15 armored vehicles and trucks with Russian flags
and KFOR, acronym for Kosovo peacekeeping force, arrived in
Belgrade Friday morning, standing by for their possible
dispatching to Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Lakes Entering Jackson Pursuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers executive
vice president Jerry West acknowledged Thursday night that the
team has explored the possibility of offering its vacant coaching
job to Phil Jackson, including discussing the parameters of such a
financial deal.
</P>
<P>
In response to a report that negotiations were underway between
the Lakers and Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, on a potential
four-year, $20-million package, West said no offer has been made
to Jackson and said "It would be wrong" to presume a deal was near.
"We've talked about a lot of different parameters to a couple
different people," said West, who added that the team has had
similar discussions with Kurt Rambis, who finished the season as
the interim coach.
</P>
<P>
West did not deny that Jackson, winner of six titles with the
Chicago Bulls, was a prime Laker prospect.
</P>
<P>
"I would say he'd be a very attractive candidate," West said.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who have traditionally not paid coaches huge
salaries, could pay Jackson or any other high-profile candidate
upward of $5 million a year, West acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Camby Steps Up for Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- It turns out that the three
games without Patrick Ewing have been much more beneficial to
Marcus Camby than Rik Smits.
</P>
<P>
The New York Knicks are leading 3-2 in the best-of-seven NBA
Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks can clinch the series with a
victory in Game 6 tonight at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
Smits, the Indiana Pacer' center, was supposed to get the
advantage of Ewing's partially torn left Achille's tendon, which
sidelined the Knick center for the rest of the playoffs after Game
2.
</P>
<P>
Instead Smits' impact has been confined mostly to a four-minute
stretch in the second quarter of Game 3, when he scored 15
consecutive points for the Pacers. He finished with 25 points in
that game, which is only five fewer than his total for the four
other games combined.
</P>
<P>
Smits has been reduced to a jump shooter, getting shots only
when players such as Mark Jackson draw defenders and pass out to
him. He didn't even go to the free-throw line in New York's 101-94
victory in Game 5 Wednesday night. He had eight points on four-for-
14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
Smits fouled out of the first two games. He picked up two fouls
in the first 30 seconds of Game 4, and spent the rest of the first
half on the bench in a game the Pacers eventually won.
</P>
<P>
Camby's energy, speed, leaping ability and long wing span have
all come into play.
</P>
<P>
He scored 21 points and 11 rebounds in Game 3, 18 and 14 in
Game 4, and 21 points, 13 rebounds and six blocks in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
Coach Jeff Van Gundy said: "I'm very happy for him because his
perseverance has been rewarded."

LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras of
the United States advanced into the semi-final of the London grass
court championships with a 7-5, 6-4 victory over eighth seed Goran
Ivanisevic of Croatia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British seventh seed Greg Rusedski flopped out of
the 750,000 U.S. dollars tournament, losing 6-2 6-4 to 74th-ranked
Armenian Sargis Sargsian.
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, who retained the world number one position after
third round victory yesterday, will meet Australia's Lleyton
Hewitt in the semi-final match.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is assured of matching Ivan Lendl's record 270 weeks as
world number one by the end of Wimbledon as nobody can catch him
before then.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt, seeded 14, kept his nerve to beat 11th seed and former
Wimbledon runner-up Cedric Pioline 7-5, 6-4 despite receiving a
code warning for an "audible obscenity".
</P>
<P>
Another semi-final match will be held between Sargasian and
British third seed Tim Henman, who squeezed into the semifinals
with a tense 6-1, 6-7, 7-6 win over Slovak sixth seed Karol Kucera.

ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz returned here late Friday night after his one-day

<HEADLINE> UN Expects Increased Repatriation of Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Friday said it expects larger
repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran following
new developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We foresee a change because of new developments which might
enlarge the number of returnees on voluntary basis," a UNHCR
spokesman, Ahmad Farah, told journalists at the U.N. Information
Center here but he didn't detailed what the new developments are.
</P>
<P>
Farah also told the weekly briefing that UNHCR aims at
repatriation of 100,000 Afghan refugees each from Pakistan and
Iran this year as well as next year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has some 1.2 million Afghan refugees in addition to
over 600,000 living outside camps. About 1.4 million Afghans stay
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
So far 43,000 Afghans have been repatriated from Pakistan while
the returnees from Iran totaled 7000, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR and the Iranian government are likely to conclude an
agreement on repatriation of Afghan refugees from Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. plans on materializing Afghan refugees' return
from Pakistan and Iran "in safety and dignity" have been hit by
financial crisis, emanating from "donor fatigue".
</P>
<P>
The fatigue stems from a variety of factors including
conditions inside Afghanistan as well as outside the strife-torn
country, most conspicuous among these being the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR which estimated 21 million U.S. dollars for
repatriation of Afghan refugees last year could only get 10
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year's estimates put the amount at 17 million dollars out
of which the body has so far received 6 million dollars only.
