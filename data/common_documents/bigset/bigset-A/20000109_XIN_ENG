<HEADLINE> Over 30 Tons of Drugs Seized in Turkey Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 tons of drugs were
seized last year in Turkey, accounting for 38 percent of total
narcotics seized in the whole world, the Anatolia News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish police uncovered 2,850 drug smuggling cases last year,
seizing over 26 tons of acid anhidrit, 5.5 tons of hashish, two
tons of heroin, 288 kilograms of basic morphin, 226 kilograms of
opium, 13 kilograms of cocain.
</P>
<P>
The volume of the seized hashish accounted for over half of the
total captured in the whole Europe, said the report, based on
statistics released by the Security General Directorate Office.
</P>
<P>
During the anti-drug operations, the police also arrested 6,121
people. In most cases, drug smugglers were caught when they were
trying to send big portions of drugs to European countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranians topped the list of drug smugglers caught in Turkey. The
anti-drug operations were carried out mainly in Turkey's largest
city of Istanbul and Van, capital of a province bordering Iran.

<HEADLINE> Russian Presidential Poll to Be Held In Chechnya: CEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian presidential
elections will be held in Chechnya on March 26 as scheduled for
other parts of the Russian Federation, said Alexander Veshnyakov,
chairman of the Russian Central Election Commission (CEC), Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I sees no serious hurdles obstructing the organization of
voting in Chechnya for the upcoming Russian presidential elections,
" Veshnyakov told an interview with the press, adding that a
preparation campaign for the presidential polls is to be launched
in Chechnya these days.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Chechnya has changed for the better from the
point of view of citizens exercising their right to vote in that
territory of Russia, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The election of Russian president, already set for March 26,
should also be organized on the territory of the Chechen republic,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that election commissions should be set up in
order to have voting there, but so far such bodies are not yet set
up in Chechnya. Under the presidential election law, "if a
commission has not been created" on any Russian territory, "the
Central Election Commission creates it."
</P>
<P>
Veshnyakov said the CEC will make its decision on forming an
election commission in Chechnya at its session on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He pledged all necessary CEC assistance to a Chechen election
commission, "including organizational, material, technical, and
financial" help.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Election Commission will soon adopt a decision
concerning the nomination of a candidate for State Duma deputy
from the 31st single-mandate district -- the Chechen republic," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thereby, Veshnyakov said, "two election processes will proceed
simultaneously" in Chechnya: "the participation of the citizens of
that republic in the federal elections for president and State
Duma deputy."
</P>
<P>
The December 19 elections into the State Duma or lower house of
the Russian parliament failed to take place in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya on time due to an ongoing federal counter-
terrorist military operation there.

<HEADLINE> Barak Admits Talks with Syrian Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said on Sunday that his talks with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara was very difficult, and did not
expect any agreement in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"there is no doubt it will be a tough diplomatic battle," Barak
told reporters when touring an American Civil War battlefield at
nearby Antietam Creek. "It is impossible now to forecast how long
it will last, or the results."
</P>
<P>
"But we will do everything to defend in the deliberations the
security and vital interests of Israel," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israelis and Syrians started their talks on Monday, and have
set up four working committees to tackle outstanding issues with
the mediation of the United States. But talks went aground on
Wednesday because of procedural differences.
</P>
<P>
Barak will leave Shepherdstown, West Virginia, on Monday for
Israel. He will leave talks in the hands of lower-level officials.
</P>
<P>
Shara will also return home on Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said President Bill Clinton is expected to come
to Shepherdstown again for mediation on Sunday night, but it might
not the final moment of presidential involvement in this round,
they said. "If called for, he could still do something tomorrow
morning," one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four committees met on Sunday, but the most
controversial, on the border after Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, has still not convened, a Syrian source said.

<HEADLINE> 8 Children Drown at Lagos Bar Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- At least eight children died from
drowning at the famous Bar Beach on Victoria Island in Nigeria's
commercial hub Lagos at the weekend, Lagos Voluntary Divers
Association confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the bodies were washed ashore and taken to the nearby
morgue as voluntary divers are searching more bodies, the divers
association said.
</P>
<P>
It could take a couple of days for bloated bodies to be washed
ashore, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
But many picnickers appeared unperturbed by the tragedy as they
dared the ocean waves, saying that "we know it is risky, but we
have to enjoy ourselves."
</P>
<P>
After their appeals fell on deaf ears of hundreds of holiday
makers at the beach Sunday, the association tried to apply horse
whips to stop the stubborn youths from swimming.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated warnings by the city authorities, it has
become an annual occurrence for people, especially youths to drown
at the Bar Beach.

<HEADLINE> Likud Urges Barak to Brief Knesset on Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition Likud Party
has urged Prime Minister Ehud Barak to inform the Knesset
(parliament) of the "working document" and other information
concerning the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister should brief the Knesset soon after his
return from the U.S. of the "working document" prepared by the
Americans and other information concerning the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks, Likud Knesset member Danny Navey said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The document appears to be the first draft of a possible peace
deal between Israel and Syria and it is prime minister's duty to
inform the public of the content of the document in the
negotiation, not after the peace deal has been signed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh started their new
round of peace talks in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Shareh are scheduled to return to the Middle East
either Monday or Tuesday, leaving behind large delegations of
experts to discuss details of security arrangements, normalization
of ties, water and borders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton presented Barak and
Shareh a seven-page working document summarizing the positions of
both sides on above-mentioned issues and putting forward U.S. ideas
for resolving them.
</P>
<P>
Likud leader Ariel Sharon on Sunday accused Barak of agreeing to
a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights without receiving anything
in return from the Syrian side.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Syrian plateau in the 1967 Middle East war and
the fate of the Heights is at the core of the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader to Meet Clinton This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adams will lead a delegation of his republican party in a
series of meetings, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Among the delegation will be Martin McGuinness, who is now one
of Sinn Fein's two ministers in Northern Ireland's coalition
government. The visit marks the first time a Sinn Fein member to
travel to Washington as a minister in the new home rule government.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process was revived in December with
the help of U.S. mediator George Mitchell when a power-sharing
government was formed involving both Irish Catholics who want to
break ties with Britain and Protestants who favor continued union.
</P>
<P>
But guerrilla disarmament is still a thorny issue and the
unionists insist the Irish Republican Army must speed its efforts
to hand in its guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said IRA guerrillas would allow
the head of Northern Ireland's disarmament body, ex-Canadian army
General John de Chastelain, to observe the "symbolic gesture" at
time and place yet to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of firearms were to be destroyed in the
controlled explosion, with the rest of their arsenal to be sealed
in monitored bunkers in the Irish republic, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
But British government officials in the Northern Ireland Office
refused to discuss reports of arms handovers.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Pray at Islamic Shrine in Southern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,600 Turkish Cypriots,
living in northern Cyprus, crossed on Sunday into the southern area
of the island to pray at one of the holiest Islamic shrines, the
Hala Sultan Mosque, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots were ferried in 33 buses supplied by the
Cyprus government and were accompanied by the Cyprus police and U.
N. vehicles.
</P>
<P>
During their pray, Cyprus police took extra security measures in
and around the Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Presidential Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs Takis
Christopoulos said that Greek Cypriots are expected to visit the
Turkish-occupied monastery of Apostolos Andreas in northern Cyprus
on Eastery Monday, on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of pilgrimages began after an agreement between
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash on humanitarian issues in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iranians Killed in MKO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Three Iranians were killed and
four others injured in a cross-border attack by the Iranian
outlawed Mujahedin Khalq Organization (MKO) on Saturday night, the
Iranian state-run television reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO launched the attack on Ilam, capital of the
border province of Ilam around 20:00 hours local time (1630 GMT),
the television said, giving no details about the attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the evening newspaper Kayhan reported that the MKO
members fired three mortar shells from a village into residential
areas in Ilam city Saturday night, causing damage to some houses.
</P>
<P>
The MKO members opened fire at three teenagers who tried to
chase them following the attack, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Iran celebrated the Eid-e Fitr on Saturday to mark the end of
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadhan.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a political-military group which fought against the
former Iranian shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq
following sharp differences with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, labeled by Iran as a "terrorist group," has launched a
series of cross-border attacks on Iran in recent years, including
assassinating senior Iranian officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARIO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League has reaffirmed its
support for the just Syrian stance in demanding the return of the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel Meguid said the
league supported Syria's demand for the restoration of the Golan,
Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war, according to the
international legitimacy resolutions and the principles of the land
for peace.
</P>
<P>
The just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East will not
materialize except by Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab
territories of the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese, the
secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
Nor will such peace be effected without the solving of the
issues of Jerusalem and the palestinian refugees under U.N.
relevant resolutions, Abdel Meguid added.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are under the second round of peace talks in
the U.S. while the Palestinians and the Jewish state are working
for a framework agreement by mid-February and a final peace deal by
September.

BAGHDAD, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
injured Sunday when U.S. and British warplanes attacked civilian
and service installations in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Iraqi civilian injuries were
reported in U.S. and British bombardment of Iraqi targets this year
and during Lesser Bairam, the festival of Fast-breaking.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:50 (0850 GMT) 10 formations of U.S
and British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti military bases
carried out 31 sorties over southern Iraq's Thi-Qar, Wasit, Basra
Muthana and Qadissiya provinces.
</P>
<P>
They bombarded some civilian and public service facilities in
the region and injured three civilians, the spokesman said, adding
they were repulsed by Iraqi missile units and air defenses.
</P>
<P>
Since the air strikes against Iraq in December 1998, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 17,420 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targeted regularly its civilian and military
targets, he added.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones because of the
lack of direct authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police have uncovered
weapons that have been smuggled from the Palestinian territories
into Israel proper, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police in the Galilee Region, northern Israel, have uncovered
illegal weapons that originated inside the autonomous areas of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and are concerned that the
weapons are being smuggled into the Galilee area to be used in
future terror attacks inside Israel, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report did not specified when the Israeli police uncovered
the weapon smuggling, but said a police investigation is continuing
and information surrounding the weapons and police activities has
been banned from publication at this time.
</P>
<P>
This was the first reported discovery about smuggling weapons
into Israel from the Palestinian territories in recent years.

MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The political council of the
Russia-wide political movement Russia Is Our Home (NDR) decided at
a meeting Sunday to support acting President Vladimir Putin's
candidacy for the March 26 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The council recommended that grass-root organizations be in

Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the movements, at the session
addressed NDR tactics in the recently elected, and third, State
Duma (lower house of parliament) as well as cooperation with the
Unity movement faction in the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
NDR as a whole collected around two percent of the votes in the
December 19 parliamentary elections. Five percent was required to
be eligible for seats in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of NDR members were elected in single-mandate
districts. These winners include Chernomyrdin and the former

Ryzhkov.

MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Georgia's industrial production
rose 3.5 percent in 1999, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
said in a recent broadcasting program of the National Radio.

Shevardnadze also noted prominent progress in agriculture:
Georgia harvested about 770,000 tons of grain, 660,000 tons of
vegetables and a record 70, 000-ton crop of tea leaves.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that this will enable the state to

<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said London would send a "strong
message" to Colonel Gaddafi's government.
</P>
<P>
"We will warn Libya they cannot evade arms embargoes by coming
through Britain," Cook told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost program.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the weapons, reportedly capable of carrying chemical
or biological warheads more than 600 miles, were discovered on 24
November at London's Gatwick airport on a flight bound for Tripoli
via Malta, a BBC report quoted Customs officers as saying. .
</P>
<P>
The shipment is reported to include 32 crates of components for
Scud missiles similar to those used by Iraq during the last Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ties between Britain and Libya were resumed last
year after Libya co-operated with handing over two Lockerbie
bombing suspects and compensated the family of Yvonne Fletcher,
the female police officer who was shot dead outside the Libyan
embassy in London in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain's newly reinstated ambassador to Libya gave
the government a direct channel of communication, which would be
used to register "deep concern".

ATHENS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A Hunduras-flagged Freighter, the

</P>
<P>
The freighter, loaded with 2,500 tons of iron, had arrived in
Kalamata port for refueling stop, but was forced to remain in port

<HEADLINE> Genetic Salmon Reported to Edge Wild Species Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Wild salmon species are being
threatened by an increasing "genetical contamination", warned
Canada's Ottawa Citizen newspaper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Accidental tinkering with genes in prized Atlantic salmon has
put whole populations of fish on the verge of extinction, the
newspaper quoted the Atlantic Salmon Federation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canadian and American scientists of the federation say that in
the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy, so few wild fish are
breeding that each river's population "is teetering on the brink
of extinction."
</P>
<P>
It's not that the wild fish are fished out. Rather the problem
is competition from domesticated salmon raised in pens, which
escape and breed with the wild fish, weakening the gene pool.
</P>
<P>
Two or three times each year, a storm will flip a cage over,
and all 10,000 or more fish in it escape, reported the newspaper,
adding that seals can also chew holes in cages to get at the
salmon inside.
</P>
<P>
The result is a dilution of the gene pool. Domesticated fish
are breeding fat, lazy, but growing quickly. They don't have the
sleek shape and muscle development of the wild fish.
</P>
<P>
When they escape and breed with wild fish, they pass on their
particular traits to a degenerated population, which may not know
where to spawn, or may try to swim down to the sea or upstream at
the wrong time of year.
</P>
<P>
The federation scientists are afraid that genetic changes are
forever and will some day come out of the lab restriction to push
their wild cousins off the map, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Russians Surround Vedeno, Rebels fighting Federals Outside Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Russians Sunday closed the
surrounding of Vedeno, native town of the Basayev brothers, two
notorious Chechen top field commanders, while rebels fiercely
fighting federal units outside Grozny, said Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Commander of the Russian Eastern Army Grouping in the North
Caucasus, General Sergei Makarov, Saturday met a group of
prestigious people from the town of Vedeno, which is deep into
mountainous Chechnya. They assured the Russian General that there
are no gunmen in the town, reported the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
According to Makarov, nobody prods troops to go anywhere. There
is no hesitate, and they will move forward when it is recognized
expedient after complete reconnaissance of local terrain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a force of around 300 militants surrounded the
Russian commandant's office and the railway station at the town of
Argun (15 kilometers east of Grozny) on Sunday evening, said an
Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
Russian elite OMON police, rapid reaction units, and the
commandant's own personnel are defending his office at the railway
station, said the temporary press center for the federal forces'
eastern grouping.
</P>
<P>
The press center further reported that the grouping's armored
division advanced on the Shali community, where fighting also took
place today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, near the Dzhalka River, a few kilometers from the
second biggest Chechen city of Gudermes, 25 kilometers east of
Grozny, a detachment of Russian Internal Ministry troops ferrying
water to the town was ambushed and forced to call for assistance.
A unit of five armored vehicles that responded was also ambushed.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is ongoing there now. No casualty figures have been
obtained so far, the press center said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chechen side claimed Sunday that the Russians had
lost more than ten armored vehicles and heavy trucks laden with
military equipment and ammunition in clashes east of Argun by
evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen president's press secretary Selim Abdulmuslimov
said, cited by the Interfax, that "Chechen Mujahideens have
occupied the district center of Shali, where Brigadier General
Aslanbek Arsayev is commanding a force of up to 500 militants.
</P>
<P>
Arsayev's forces are taking steps in the center of Shali to
restore the bodies of power of the so-called Republic of Chechnya,
also known as Ichkeria, said Abdulmuslimov.
</P>
<P>
The Ichkerian flag has been raised over the town hall in place
of the Russian standard and a prefect for the Shali district has
been appointed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary denied the Russian military's report that
federal elite OMON police troops and Chechen Mujahideens are
engaged in fighting at Shali.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Publish Reading Materials In Local Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The African Publishers Network
Sunday called upon African countries to publish reading materials
in local languages to achieve mass literacy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, the network said that
communication is most effective when carried out in local
languages which the people understand without difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"If mass literacy is to be achieved, it must be in the
languages that people speak and read," said the non-governmental
organization seeking to promote publishing in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Basic literacy materials must be available as well as books,
magazines and other publications to ensure that literacy skills be
maintained," it added.
</P>
<P>
The network also said women in Africa needed relevant materials
in local languages since they had little access to schooling and
foreign officials languages.
</P>
<P>
The organization would be represented at a conference on
African Languages and Literatures into the 21st Century in Eritrea
next week, where countries would be urged to strengthen indigenous
languages.
</P>
<P>
The conference would be attended by more than 2,000 students,
scholars, writers, publishers and artists throughout the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The conference is founded in the belief that to achieve
greatness, a country or continent must develop its culture and
economy simultaneously through a primary reliance on its
indigenous languages.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Party to Take Seats in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National
Resistance (Renamo) , main opposition party of the country, has
reversed its initial decision to boycott the first sitting of the
newly-elected Assembly of the Republic scheduled for January 14.
</P>
<P>
The Renamo National Council, meeting in emergency session in
Maputo Saturday, authorized the 117 deputies elected by Renamo and
its "Electoral Union" coalition allies to take their seats. The
"Electoral Union" consists of Renamo plus 10 minor parties.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Renamo General Secretary Joal Alexandre said
that Renamo deputies would not take their seats until their demand
for a recount of the votes in the December 3-5 general elections
had been met.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Renamo changed its position some deputies
from minor parties had made it clear that they would not join any
boycott, the Mozambique News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 117 seats taken by the oppositorce of law,
any deputy who fails to take his or her seat, with no valid
justification, within 30 days of the opening of the new
parliament, is automatically excluded.
</P>
<P>
However, Alexandre insisted that Renamo's decision to take its
seats did not mean that it recognized the poll results.
</P>
<P>
He said that Renamo continued to reject the results and would
use its position in parliament to fight for a recount of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
If the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo)
rejected Renamo's demands, Renamo would divide the country,
Alexandre threatened.
</P>
<P>
In that case Renamo would set up its own governments in the six
 provinces (Sofala, Manica, Tete, Zambezia, Nampula and Niassa)
where Renamo took a majority of the votes.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether this threat is to be taken seriously,
or is just a face-saving device to cover up Renamo's climb-down
over the parliamentary boycott.

<HEADLINE> India Calls for More Hindsight in Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI January 9 (Xinhua) -- India would chart its own
course in the globalisation process as no system in the world
could work without answering the demands of the poor, External
Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the "Partnership Summit 2000," organized by the
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the minister said the gap
between the richest and the poorest in this country has doubled in
the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Globalization should be carried out on equitable grounds, Singh
told the three-day meeting, which is attended by top
industrialists and chiefs of a large number of multinational
companies.
</P>
<P>
He said that Globalisation of today is based on the model
influenced by the United States which is the sole superpower
politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Although the standards based on this model are assumed to be
universally applicable, the Indian minister said, it could be
challenged at a certain stage.
</P>
<P>
He noted that out of the six billion world population, 1.3
billion live on one U.S. dollar a day and over three billion on
two dollars per day.
</P>
<P>
Singh reiterated that the fundamental thrust of globalisation
should be to improve the quality of the life of the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Globalisation should not be seen as a certainty," he declared,
adding that it was for this reason that globalisation should be
applied with more hindsight than before.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the delegates, CII president Rahul Rajaj asserted
that managing globalisation was a key issue for both developed and
developing countries as the world is getting increasingly complex
and competitive.

WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Just when it seemed that relations between India and
Pakistan could not get much worse, the eight-day hijacking of an
Indian Airlines Plane by Muslim separatists has plunged the two
rivals into an alarming new round of accusations and name calling.
</P>
<P>
-- Mortar volleys and small arms fire persisted on the
outskirts of Grozny Saturday despite Russia's announcement of a
temporary halt to air and artillery bombardment of the besieged
Chechen capital, according to Chechen refugees and Russian news
reports.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With the 2000 budget still not approved, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso has summoned lawmakers back to Brasilia for a
special session that began last week and is intended to force them
to keep working until his agenda can be voted on.
</P>
<P>
-- Vladimir Putin, acting president of Russia, said that the
decision to suspend the bombardment of Grozny was taken to spare
civilians and to honor Orthodox and Muslims celebrating holidays
this weekend. The halt appears to be prelude to an even more
furious assault on the Chechen capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Standing in extremely cold
weather for five hours, the Carter Center delegation from the U.S.
today observed 988 Daguanzhuang village farmers elect their
village head for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Gordon L.Streeb, head of the Carter Center delegation said, "
The whole process was efficient, smooth."
</P>
<P>
This "election in the snow" in Daguanzhuang village of Qianxi
county in the city of Tangshan in north China's Hebei Province is
just one example of what has happened in one million of China's
villages. This election was the first of its kind since the "
Organic Village Committee Law of the People's Republic of China"
was promulgated in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
This law gives every villager the power to nominate and elect
village officials, and for the first time prohibits, by law, any
organization from nominating candidates.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Chengfu, director of the Rural Areas Division of the
Grass-roots Political Power Building Department under the Civil
Affairs Ministry, said that this law is a breakthrough, and helps
hundreds of millions of Chinese farmers to make their own choices
by free, fair, and just elections.
</P>
<P>
The devastating Tangshan earthquake of 1976 claimed 240,000
lives, destroyed over 97 percent of the city's industrial and
civil infrastructure, and caused over three billion yuan of direct
economic losses. Now, the city has the 25th highest GDP in the
country, over 50 billion yuan, as it makes democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
The Daguanzhuang village election began at nine o'clock this
morning after the eight villagers committee candidates made their
election speeches according to strict election speech regulations.
</P>
<P>
Guan Hengcheng, 68, said: "The candidates have faced all the
voters and expressed themselves in their election speeches, which
is helpful for increasing election transparency. Today's election
is fair, and we feel sure about electing village cadres in this
way."

<P>
The long vote-counting process began after brief speeches by
the villagers committee candidates. The courtyard of the villagers
committee was like an ice house, but the voters remained, and they
stood in the cold for five hours, hundreds of eyes watching the
vote tally on a blackboard, and anxiously waited for results.
</P>
<P>
Gordon L. Streeb head of this first foreign delegation invited
by the Ministry of Civil Affairs to observe a village-level
election this year, said that they witnessed the villagers
nominate candidates in the first round, without any outside
interference, and the voters got a further understanding of the
villagers committee candidates in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Qianxi County had formulated the country's first election
speech regulations which required all candidates to participate in
election speeches, and also stipulated time schedules, place, and
format. The villagers committee election is the form of direct
elections in China, and also the nation's most developed grass-
root democratic mode now.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Chengfu noted: "China's grass-root elections have
developed to today's level based not on empty words, but on law
and a standard election process. Qianxi's regulations have set a
good example for others to follow."
</P>
<P>
Professor Shi Weimin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
pointed out that village-level leadership is the first step toward
realizing grass-root democracy. Ensuring that these leaders
administer village affairs under the supervision of villagers
still needs a more developed system of guarantee.

<HEADLINE> mee010905 hke -- Israel's Violation of Human Rights in Lebanon Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- For two decades, the Israel
Defense Force (IDF) and the South Lebanon Army (SLA) have violated
fundamental human rights of Lebanese civilians, said a report
issued by an Israeli organization here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the IDF and the SLA have committed war crimes, the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories (B'tselem) said in its report outlining details of
Israel's violations of human rights of Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The IDF and the SLA have been carrying out extra-judicial
detention of Lebanese civilians and other persons in south Lebanon
for prolonged periods and torture them during interrogations, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The IDF and the SLA also abduct persons and hold them as
hostages in Israeli prisons, expulse residents from the occupied
zone in south Lebanon, arbitrarily restrict freedom of movement and
conduct forcible conscription of residents, including minors, into
the SLA, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it said, the IDF and the SLA, in violation of laws
of war, often fire indiscriminately inside the security zone in
south Lebanon, killing hundreds of civilians. They also use weapons
prohibited by the laws of war, it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report criticized the Israeli public for lacking
a collective consciousness on the IDF and the SLA's violations of
human rights on Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli public debate has almost ignored the sufferings
inflicted on Lebanese civilians, the residents of the security zone
in particular, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-claimed purpose of protecting its security in the north. The
IDF and the SLA have been battling local military groups since
then.

adding they were pushed into Indian territory by Pakistani troops
with a directive to join the active militants to carry out
subversive activities in Kashmir.

an encounter in Bhangla area of Kashmir Saturday night and seized
a pistol and a wireless set.

</P>
<P>
Some UNITA rebels opened fire on a vehicle in which a French
family travelled on Monday evening in Namibia's Caprivi region
near Angolan borders. Three French children were killed, and their
parents seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government said that the bodies of the three
French children were due to arrive back in France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan offensive, backed by Windhoek, which gave
permission for Angola's troops to launch attacks from Namibian
soil last December, is aimed at crushing rebel bases of UNITA in
southern Angola and end a decades- old civil war.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Soldier Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIRUT, Lebanon, January 9 (Xinhua) - An Israeli soldier was
wounded Sunday when a bomb blew up beside his car when it crossed
the border into the south Lebanon, an Israeli statement broadcast
on the radio of Israeli's militia ally monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was wounded on the Lebanese-Israeli border near
the village of Markaba, just inside a 15-km zone Israel occupies
in south Lebanon, the statement of the Southern Lebanon Army said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army in Jerusalem confirmed the attack on the
soldier's vehicle, saying he was slightly hurt and treated on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Syrian and Iranian backed organization
Hizbollah or Party of God claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"This explosion hit the target and definitely caused
casualties. The operation confirms the failure of Israeli tactics
and sophisticated electronics in preventing the penetrations of
the Islamic resistance," a statement by Hizbollah said.
</P>
<P>
Hizbollah and other Lebanese moslem groups are fighting a war
of attrition to drive out Israel from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which occupied parts of Lebanon since 1978, set up the
so called security zone in 1985, claiming that it needed to
protect its northern settlements from potential cross border
attacks by Lebanese militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 12 Israeli soldiers were killed and 55 others
wounded in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Unheralded Weiss Stops Aamodt from Historic Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Unheralded Angelo Weiss became the
first Italian since Alberto Tomba to win a World Cup slalom on
Sunday, denying Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt a historic win and a
place in the history books.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old, whose best World Cup result previously was
fifth in Aspen last year, timed two minutes 1.27 seconds after two
runs to triumph unexpectedly in Chamonix, France.
</P>
<P>
It was Italy's first slalom win since Tomba triumphed in Crans
Montana two years ago in his last race before he retired from
competitive skiing.
</P>
<P>
Weiss also dashed the hopes of another skiing great Aamodt who,
leading after the first run, had been poised to collect his first
career slalom win to become only the fourth skier in the history
of the World Cup to post wins in all five alpine events.
</P>
<P>
Those who have achieved the feat are Swiss Pirmin Zurbriggen,
Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli and Austria's Guenther Mader.
</P>
<P>
But the Norwegian, world slalom champion in 1993 in Morioka,
had to settle for second place in 2:01.71, with Slovenian Matjaz
Vrhovnik placed third in 2:01.75.
</P>
<P>
Aamodt, who was 10th in Saturday's downhill, earned the
consolation of winning the combined event. Downhill winner and
World Cup leader Hermann Maier of Austria was second in the
combined, ahead of Swiss Paul Accola.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Calls for Training More Young Cadres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) today urged that great importance
be given to selecting and training more young cadres in order to
ensure the Party's future and the country's long-term political
stability.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Qinghong, head of the Organization Department of the CPC
Central Committee, told a national conference of Party
organization department chiefs that further efforts should be made
to enhance the sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency in
selecting and training young cadres.
</P>
<P>
Young cadres should be added to leading groups which now have
few young cadres, said Zeng who is also an alternate member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Inter-regional cadre transfer should be considered, and
outstanding people may be promoted, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Party will improve its supervision system
for selecting, training, using and administrating cadres, and for
fighting corruption in this regard, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that currently the Party is supporting high profile
campaign to develop western China by dispatching talented cadres
to the region. Organizational departments should provide talented

</P>
<P>
He urged Party officials to arm themselves with Marxism-
Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, as well as
modern knowledge, so they can perform their professional duties
well while leading a plain style of life.

<HEADLINE> China to Modernize Housing Construction in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to modernize its
housing construction industry over the next ten years in two
phases, according to an official with the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiaoqing, deputy director of the housing
industrialization office of the Ministry of Construction, revealed
the plan at a seminar on real estate strategy, recently concluded
in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
He said China will work hard in the first decade of the 21st
century to improve the quality of housing projects, establish a
standardized system for the use of building materials, and ensure
energy-saving and high-tech applications in housing construction.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, housing projects should satisfy people's
primary demands, and a comparatively standardized building
material system should be in place, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Apartment buildings by then are expected to consume 50 percent
less energy and increase the application of science and technology
to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, buildings should satisfy people's demands for
long-time and comfortable living, according to the plan, and
building materials should be standardized and its supplies
socialized. By then, energy consumption will be reduced by
another 30 percent and technology application increased to 35
percent.

<HEADLINE> Science Pays Off in Developing China's Oil Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- China has developed an important
theory in the field of continental petroleum geology through many
years of research and experiment, one that runs parallel to an
influential international theory on hydrocarbon formation in
marine geology.
</P>
<P>
This theory has significantly boosted China's oil development,
said Shen Pingping, head of the China Petroleum Exploration and
Development Academy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on China's Oil Development Strategy in the
21st Century, Shen noted that by using this theory China has
located 27 large oilfields, each with deposits above 100 million
tons, including such well-known oilfields as Daqing in northeast
and Renqiu in north China.
</P>
<P>
The senior expert said that with research and practice, China
has also developed technologies of layer-by-layer oil extraction
and stabilizing oil reserves with injected water, and has utilized
the polymer-drive extraction method, all comparable to advanced
methods used around the world.
</P>
<P>
Other major oilfields in Bohai Bay areas such as Shengli,
Liaohe, Zhongyuan, Huabei, and Dagang have developed rolling
exploration technology, which has increased oil exploration in the
area.
</P>
<P>
So far, the bay areas of the Bohai Sea have been proven to have
oil deposits of nearly 8 billion tons, and an annual crude output
of over 60 million tons, making it the second-largest oil and gas
production base in China after Daqing, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In the exploration of complex oil layers, China has come up
with a range of thermodynamic technologies to explore thick oil,
mainly by the use of steam.
</P>
<P>
The country also has developed an annual thick oil output of 12
million tons, the fourth largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
To boost oil and gas development in the 21st century, China now
is launching a group of petroleum science and technology projects
and a series of technological developments nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Nigerians in Lagos Seek Police Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 35 prominent Nigerians have
asked the Lagos police to provide them with personal and
residential security as a result of the upsurge in criminal
activities in the city, the Sunday Punch newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Among them are well-known bank chief executives, company
proprietors, directors and some retired senior military and police
officers, who started the submission of their applications to the
Lagos State Police Command about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Many of them, according to a senior police officer, wanted
police guards mounted in and around their places of residence,
including personal plain- cloth security attaches.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos State Police Command, which is already facing some
constraints, has asked the Federal government and the police
headquarters in Abuja to recruit another 10,000 officers and men,
and provide 1,000 vehicles to enable the police in Lagos State to
meet the new challenges.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, the Lagos police command currently
has about 10,000 policemen and 200 vehicles, over half of which
have been grounded for what was regarded as lack of maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Officials Punished for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Discipline inspection and
supervision departments in China's southernmost province of Hainan
handled a total of 352 corruption cases and punished 302 people
involved in the first 11 months of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Ding Bodong, secretary-general of the
Hainan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) at a press conference held over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Among those punished were six bureau-level officials, 23
county-level officials, 70 township-level cadres, and 158 ordinary
Party members, he said.
</P>
<P>
The punishments range from dismissal from their posts and
expulsion from the CPC to being handed over to judiciary
departments for trial.
</P>
<P>
The penalized officials include Huang Xingfu, former mayor of
the city of Dongfang, who was found guilty of taking bribes worth
82,000 yuan (about 10,000 US dollars) and gifts worth 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Dongfang's former vice-mayor, Lu Yuping, was also punished
after being found guilty of taking bribes worth 10,000 yuan and
bribing others with 40,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lu Wanchao, former head of the Hainan Grain Bureau, is still at
large after discipline officials informed him that he was under
investigation in a corruption case.

<HEADLINE> mee010904 Roundup: Traffic Accidents, Main threat to People in UAE  by Liu Guoyuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- While people in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) enjoy the enduring economic and political stability
brought by the country's huge oil wealth and strict Islamic rule,
they face a serious daily threat - traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
The small Gulf country boasts modern highways and streets, but
they ironically bring about traffic dangers by encouraging drivers
to drive fast.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Abu Dhabi, pedestrians must be very careful while
crossing streets, because cars and other vehicles rarely give way.
Even though people stand by a sidewalk, they are in fear of being
swept away by the strong wind speeding cars carry.
</P>
<P>
For drivers, the streets and roads are also dangerous, because
when they threaten others with their cars, they are also threatened
by other cars.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are reported almost daily on local papers, and
for readers, that one or two people are killed or injured on roads
is simply not news.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by UAE traffic departments, every
year road accidents kill around 600 people and seriously injure 5,
000 others in the country. The death ratio of the UAE population is
about 200 per million, far higher than that of Britain, which is 60
per million.
</P>
<P>
Another startling point is the cost of health treatment and care
for victims of UAE traffic accidents. A recent study estimates the
total annual bill for traffic accidents in the country is around 2
billion dirhams (545 million U.S. dollars) or 5.4 million dirhams
(1.47 million dollars) per day. The figure includes hospital fees,
damage to property and vehicles, police charges and insurance
expenditure, and a notional sum for pain, grief and suffering of
people.
</P>
<P>
Besides overspeed and reckless driving, which accounts for more
than 60 percent of the cause of fatal road accidents, the rapid
increase in the number of vehicles is another factor in accidents.
As people's purchasing power has increased, the real cost of a new
car has declined. Two-, or three-car families are now very common
in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, there were about 30,000 cars and other vehicles
registered in the UAE, but now there are more than 600,000 running
on the roads.
</P>
<P>
Road death and injury figures in the UAE present a horrible
picture. It is like a war on the roads, residents complain, saying
that in a small country like the UAE, the big number of deaths is
not acceptable by any standards.
</P>
<P>
Concerning over the dangers on the UAE's roads, the Ministry of
Health is cooperating with other government departments in
finalizing a 10-year program aimed at reducing the current 14.8
percent death rate in traffic accidents to as low as 2 percent by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The concrete steps include launching education programs for
motorists, strict enforcement of traffic laws and a substantial
reduction of speed, eliminating problems arising from the design
and construction of roads, limiting the issue of driving licenses
as well as establishing an efficient network of ambulances and
emergency centers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Citizens' Income Down 15 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 year witnessed Russians'
real income dropping 15 percent from 1998, said the Russian
Economy Ministry Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports said that the nominal designated average
monthly wage received by workers of state-run and small
enterprises amounted to 1,565 rubles (57 U.S. dollars) in December
1999, which was 49 percent more than that in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
But in dollar terms the average monthly wage stood at 67-68
dollars over the past four months of 1999, against 74 dollars in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, the real designated wage of a worker, with
consumer prices taken into account, decreased by over 20 percent
in comparison with 1998's level.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Refutes Russia's Accusation of Supporting Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry
on Saturday expressed in a statement "profound concern and
indignation" over Moscow's accusation of assisting Chechen rebels
on its territory.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Friday that
a Chechen rebel stronghold for waging a long drawn-out war in
Chechnya is being created in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry described the Russian
statement as "a flagrant provocation and falsification," according
to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Republic of Azerbaijan respects Russia's
territorial integrity, but noted that Russia has failed to present
a single fact proving that Chechen gangs are based in Azerbaijan,
or that rebels are being transferred to Chechnya from Azerbaijan,
or that the Chechen leaders maintain contacts with Azerbaijani
officials.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also expressed concern that the Russian and the
world public opinion are being manipulated in order to entangle
Azerbaijan in the conflict in the North Caucasus, and urged the
Russian side "to stop escalating the anti-Azerbaijani propaganda."
</P>
<P>
It also condemned "some of the Russian mass media's subversive
activity aimed at damaging friendly and good-neighborly relations
between Azerbaijan and Russia."

items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As the current round of Israeli-Syrian peace talks enters its
final stages, a bipartisan delegation of top-ranking U.S. senators
is to travel to Israel this week to discuss funding for a peace
deal, a senior Israeli lobbyist said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of the powerful Senate
Appropriations Committee and Daniel Inouye, a ranking Democrat on
the committee, will lead the delegation.
</P>
<P>
A total cost of an Israeli redepolyment for the Golan has been
estimated at roughly 17 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Compulsory army service for 18-yearl-old Israelis will be
reduced by six months beginning in August 2001 if a peace treaty
with Syria is signed and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdraws
from Lebanon, the army's Human Resources Branch has decided.
</P>
<P>
The decision still requires the approval of Chief of Staff Shaul
Mofaz. Male draftees currently serve a three-year stint in the IDF.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- At least nine Israeli ministers, including Finance Minister
Avraham Shochat, are against the appointment of David Klein to
succeed Jacob Frenkel as the governor of the Bank of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak made the announcement from
Shepherdstown, West Virginia to nominate Klein, a Frenkel-clone who
is considered the main architect behind the central bank's
controversial policy of maintaining high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton convened a 25-minute trilateral
meeting with Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk al-Shareh, the

<P>
He presented them with a seven-page working document that
summarizes the positions of both sides on borders, water,
normalization of bilateral relations, and security and suggests U.
S. ideas for resolving differences.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Syrian negotiators are expected to respond to the
wording document on Sunday night, but Barak and al-Shareh have
decided to return to the Middle East Monday night.

HONG KONG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong League XI was held
to a 1-1 draw by Guangdong here Sunday in the second leg of the
22nd Guangdong-Hong Kong Soccer Cup but Hong Kong regained the cup
with a 2-1 victory on aggregate over the two legs.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has kept the Cup six times in a row before and was
totally titled 16 times in the two-side traditional contest which
was inaugurated in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Similar to the first and away leg, Hong Kong League XI, nine of
first line-up are foreigners, dominated the match with their
height and fighting spirit.

<HEADLINE> mee010901 hke -- Israel to Shorten Army Service if Peace Treaty With Syria Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua)-- Israel will reduce its
compulsory army service by six months beginning in August 2001 if a
peace treaty is signed with Syria and Israel Defense Force(IDF)
withdraws from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The decision to conditionally cut the IDF service from current
36 months to 30 was made several days ago by IDF's Human Resources
Branch of the General Staff, local daily Ha'aretz quoted reliable
IDF source as reporting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision still requires the approval of Chief of General
Staff Shaul Mofaz.
</P>
<P>
A high-level Israeli-Syrian peace talks is underway at
Shepherdstown, West Virginia, the Untied States, on which the
Israelis and Syrians were chugging along the path to peace.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.S. State Department's assessment of the five days
of
talks between the two longtime foes was that little progress
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The original Israeli Military Law set army service for males
between 18 and 26 years old to 30 months. This was extended to
three years after the 1967 Six-Day War, though it was not until
1995 that the extra half-year was legally formalized in an
emergency order.
</P>
<P>
The order has been renewed every year since then. The current
order will expire on June 17, 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to calculations made by the General Staff, the IDF
will save about 200 million U.S. dollars a year by cutting
compulsory service for males to 30 months from its present 36.
</P>
<P>
However. most of the money saved will be paid for alternative
manpower in the career army or among civilians.

<HEADLINE> Iran Committed to Turkish Gas Accord, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran is fully committed to the
multi-billion-dollar deal signed in 1996 to export natural gas to
Turkey, the local newspaper Iran Daily on Sunday quoted an official
at the Iranian Oil Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke to the daily on the condition of
anonymity, said a flame will be lit this week at Bazargan, the
joint border of the two countries to show Tehran's commitment.
</P>
<P>
The construction phase of the pipeline project inside the
Iranian territory has been completed, he said, adding that Iran, by
doing so, wishes to demonstrate its good will for bolstering
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Iran is concerned, all the necessary measures for the
implementation of the agreement are in place," the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Iran will annually export two billion
cubic meters of gas to Turkey in the initial phase and will
increase the volume to 10 million cubic meters per year by 2005.
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the Turkish state-run oil company Botas
said on Thursday that Turkey will ask Iran to postpone the delivery
of Iranian gas until next year because the pipeline has not yet
been completed.
</P>
<P>
"Botas General Director Gokhan Yardim and his delegation will
try to sign an agreement for Iran to start exporting gas to Turkey
in 2001," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation was reported to arrive here on Monday to
discuss a "take-or-pay" clause in the 1996 agreement under which
Turkey will have to pay for the Iranian gas that has not been
delivered because the pipeline is not ready.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an official from the Iranian National Oil Company
voiced Tehran's readiness to export gas to Ankara according to the
deal while blaming the Turkish side for being unready to accept
Iranian gas.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's increasing gas consumption will reach 15.8 billion
cubic meters in 2000 and may approach 55 billion cubic meters in
2010.

<HEADLINE> Uzbeks Start Voting in Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek voters Sunday began to cast
their ballots in the presidential elections in the ex-Soviet and
Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The country has 12.7 million registered voters who were
expected to vote for their next president at 7,800 polling
stations.
</P>
<P>
The two contenders are the incumbent President Islam Karimov,
and Abdulkhafiz Dzhalalov, first secretary of the Central Council
of the People's Democratic Party, one of the largest political
parties with half a million members.
</P>
<P>
Karimov was nominated by the Fidokorlar (Dedicated) Party. His
candidacy was also supported at the National Congress by the
Adolat (Justice) Social Democratic Party, the Vatan Trakiyeti (the
Progress of the Motherland) Party and the Miliy Tiklanishi (
National Revival) Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Nazhmitdin Kamilov, chairman of Uzbekistan's Central Electoral
Commission, said the polling process will be monitored by more
than 100 observers from foreign countries and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that in the current poll voters are most
likely to hand President Islam Karimov five more years in power,
because in a state increasingly rocked by ethnic and religious
strife, Karimov's firm stand against Islamist fundamentalism has
gone down well with the population.
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues in the impoverished state, where stability
is seen as priority amid ethnic and religious tension, are social
order and the improvement of living standards.
</P>
<P>
Most voters said that they will vote for Islam Karimov,
believing that with him there will be peace, a guarantee of a good
future and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Voters in Tashkent, capital of the republic, started casting
their ballot upon at 6 a.m. (0100 GMT) on a snowy morning,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
"Voting has begun and we are expecting a very high turnout,"
said Shokhida Yokubzhonovna, head of the polling station in School
No. 110 in Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
"During the parliamentary election in December we had a 91-93
percent turnout at this polling station. We may even get 99
percent this time around," she added with a smile.
</P>
<P>
Over 12 million of the 24 million population in the country are
eligible to vote in the election which will close at 8 p.m. (1500
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution and the existing law, a president is
elected for a five-year term and only for two terms in succession.
</P>
<P>
The candidate winning more than 50 percent of the vote will be
declared elected. If neither candidate wins the legal percentage,
then a new election is called.
</P>
<P>
The final results will be published no later than 10 days after
the voting. But preliminary results were expected to be available
early on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda will set up a National
Police Force to replace the National Gendarmerie and local defense
force as soon as all legal technicalities are finalized, according
to Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Denis Kareera, Commander of the National Gendarmerie, was
quoted as saying that "the law establishing Rwanda National Police
has already sailed through cabinet and Parliament but awaits legal
instruments to facilitate the day-to-day running of the force, the
president's signature and consequent gazetting."
</P>
<P>
"The initial National Police Force will be comprised of 3,500
policemen, who will be selected from the existing soldiers of the
National Gendarmerie, local defense and the public," said Kareera,
who is in charge of establishing the new National Police.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "there will be an especially targeted
recruitment of university graduates because the new National
Police is to be one that is literate and suitable for the times we
are in."
</P>
<P>
The National Gendarmerie is a security organ of the Ministry of
Defense. On commencement of the National Police Force, those
Gendarmerie soldiers failing to be taken on will have the option
of joining the Rwandan Patriotic Army, he said.

<HEADLINE> Economy in Ethnic Minority-Inhabited Areas in SW China Develops Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The economy in ethnic minority-
inhabited areas in Yunnan Province, southwest China, have
developed rapidly over the past two decades thanks to the local
government's preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
These areas' gross domestic product in 1998 was 17.6 times that
of 1978, and the financial revenue went up by 13.2 times, and the
average per capita income of farmers up 14.7 times.
</P>
<P>
Although the population of ethnic minorities accounts for only
one-third of the province's total, the area of these regions makes
up 70 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The economic development of the ethic group-inhabited areas,
however, still lags behind the rest of the province because of
historical and natural factors.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government has decided to allocate an
extra 30 million yuan every year to help ethnic minority-inhabited
areas to develop agriculture between 2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
Besides, preferential policies will be worked out to encourage
the development of power, telecommunications, road, water
conservatory and other sectors in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Opposition to Intensify  Anti-govt Agitation By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The next two months will be
critical for the Bangladeshi government as the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance has already
adopted a new strategy to intensify the on-going anti-government
agitation, particularly in Dhaka, after the holy Eid.
</P>
<P>
In a major move to heat up the campaign, BNP Chairperson Begum
Khaleda Zia has asked BNP leaders to stay in the capital to take
responsibility for coordinating future agitation like processions,
mass contact or picketing during hartal (destructive strike).
</P>
<P>
BNP insiders said Khaleda Zia took the decision to show the
party's strength in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chief told her party colleagues that tough programs
would be spelt out gradually to take the movement to its climax.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia is spearheading the current movement with Jatiya
Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote (Islami Solidarity
Front), pressing for the resignation of the government and holding
a general election under caretaker administration.
</P>
<P>
She felt that if the agitation could be intensified in Dhaka,
it will spontaneously spread to all over the country rapidly.
</P>
<P>
About the modality of the next agitation, a senior BNP leader
said the alliance is contemplating different strategies starting
from mass contacts, mass processions, street corner meetings to
hartals and sieges.
</P>
<P>
He said the movement would get momentum like the "speed of an
electric fan," hinting that the movement would be brought to its
peak in March.
</P>
<P>
Placing emphasis on the participation of students in the
current campaign, Khaleda Zia at a recent closed-door meeting
asked the leaders of BNP's student group to take the lead in the
movement and reminded them that "students played the key role in
all historic movements."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation over Bangladesh Television Saturday
evening on the eve of the holy Eid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
once again called upon the opposition to shun the path of hartal,
confrontation, agitation and poll-boycott and resolve all issues
amicably.
</P>
<P>
She said the hartals called by the opposition caused untold
sufferings to the common people of the country. "It is possible to
resolve any issue through discussions."

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Hosts Exhibition On AIDS Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 40,000 people have
visited an ongoing exhibition on AIDS prevention and control held
in Sichuan Museum in Chengdu, capital city of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
With 1,500 pictures, 200 slides and dozens of videos and laser
discs, the exhibition displays the harm of the deadly decease and
ways for prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which opened ten days ago, was the first of its
kind held in this landlocked province, whose HIV/AIDs cases
reportedly rank the fourth in China.
</P>
<P>
China had officially reported more than 12,000 confirmed cases
of HIV infection throughout the country by the end of 1998. Of
them, 439 patients developed full-blown AIDS and 337 have died.
</P>
<P>
But experts estimate the actual number of HIV/AIDS cases has
exceeded 300,000 and may hit 1.2 million this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to the
prevention and control of the disease, calling for education in
this aspect in colleges, secondary vocational schools and junior
middle schools throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
China's ministries of health and education are reportedly
cooperating in the compilation of an AIDS-education textbook.

organization working in Nepal has threatened to enter Bhutan en
masse if no steps are taken by May 2000 towards repatriating the

<P>
The English daily said that according to a press release issued
by the Bhutanese Refugee Representative Repatriation Committee (

refugees will move en masse to Bhutan if nothing happens by May
2000 to resolve the Bhutanese refugee crisis.

Announcing the year 2000 as the Year of Peace for Bhutanese
Refugee Crisis Resolution and Reconciliation, Subba said BRRRC
will change its strategies if repatriation does not take place by

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepali films, which used to
draw few viewers in cinema halls in border areas of Jhapa district,
are now attracting crowds and in great demand, the Kathmandu Post
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nepali films have surpassed Hindi movies in terms of the number
of viewers in cinema halls in the eastern district of Jhapa which
borders India, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
According to local cinema hall proprietors, the number of
cinema-goers preferring Nepali movies has been increasing in
cinema halls which used to depend on Hindi movies for business.
</P>
<P>
The proprietors said that previously there were fears of
running into a loss if one ran a Nepali movie, but the situation
was now just the opposite.

One would go on loss if the hall did not show a Nepali movie
instead, they said.
</P>
<P>
But for most Nepalese, watching Indian films is still one of
their main entertainments while Nepali films, still in its infancy
stage, do not cater to their demands.

investigation is still underway.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the blaze started when a container of
inflammable liquid left at the door to the offices on the ground
floor of an apartment building in Rome's San Giovanni residential
district was set afire.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters quickly put out the fire and cleared the four-
story building as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
Tenants of apartments next to the National Front offices were
treated in hospital for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
Damage was limited to computers and furnishings in the
political organization's offices, with a few windows broken and
adjoining apartments and the stairwell blackened by smoke.
</P>
<P>
National Front spokesman Carlo Breschi said their offices had
been in the building for two years and they had never received a
threat.
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand the reason for what happened. I'm
surprised that in the year 2000, provocation and attacks are
continuing and take us back 20 or 30 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Breschi claimed his movement has 500 members in Rome and 2,800
others and sympathizers in the provinces.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Commander Warns Against Peace-Keepers' Default on Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's Third Army
Commander Nebojsa Pavkovic on Saturday urged U.N. peace-keepers to
implement the U.N. Resolution 1244 and stop ethnic Albanian
extremists from killing and demolishing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to recruits being sworn into military service in
Bujanovac, Pavkovic said Yugoslavia has the right to demand that
the U.N. Security Council pull back the peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo if they continue to default on their obligations as
specified in the said U.N. Resolution, the Yugoslav Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kosovo is part of the Yugoslav territory and the
Yugoslav national flag will again fly at the border posts.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav official statistics said that since the international
peace-keepers made their way into Kosovo in July 1999, about 450
people have been killed, over 50,000 houses demolished and 330,000
residents forced to flee home in the "ethnic cleansing" conducted
by ethnic Albanian extremists against residents of other ethnic
origins.

<HEADLINE> Maradona's Condition Stable and Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer great
Diego Maradona, who tested positive for cocaine after being
hospitalized in Uruguay this week, is improving, his doctor said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Maradona's condition is stable and shows a remarkable
improvement both in the cardiovascular and in the psychomotor
fields," said Frank Torres, Maradona's doctor at the Cantegril
clinic in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old star with a history of drug problems was
admitted to the hospital on Tuesday with hypertension and an
irregular heartbeat. On Wednesday, he tested positive for cocaine,
setting off a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Torres authorised Maldonado Department Judge Adriana de los
Santos to interrogate the athlete and said that Maradona was
healthy enough to testify on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Victor Della Valle, an Uruguayan lawyer advising Maradona, said
that Maradona was willing to testify and that the judge might
interrogate him at the hospital later on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Maradona is not under arrest because drug use is not illegal in
Uruguay. Drug trafficking, however, is a crime there.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Maximo Costa Rocha told Reuters that anti-drug
forces were trying to find out from whom Maradona got the drugs.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia's Tough Choices in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- After achieving faster-than-
expected growth by spending heavily at home in 1999, Asian
governments this year will have to tackle the issue of rising
public debts, which would make recoveries unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
However, either cutting domestic spending or raising taxes, or
both, to solve the problem, would hurt business and foreign
investments. That is why Asian governments would have to make
tough choices.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Asian economies picked up their pace of growth, after
running out of steam in the last three years, mainly due to a
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of developing Asia grew by 5.7
percent in the year from 2.3 percent in 1998. Southeast Asian
countries' performances were even more remarkable, with a 2-3
percent growth rate, compared to a negative 7 percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
But as the growth was achieved by heavy domestic spending,
budget deficits surged very fast in many countries, such as
Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to a Jardine Fleming forecast, budget deficits are
expected to grow to 4 percent of the GDP in Indonesia in 1999, 3.8
percent of GDP in Malaysia, 2.7 percent of GDP in South Korea and
4.5 percent of GDP in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
And in 2000, it says, such a rate is expected to increase to 7
percent in Indonesia, 5 percent in Malaysia, 2.1 percent in South
Korea and 6 percent in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
With the huge deficits, government debts in these countries,
include domestic and foreign debts, are rising quickly. According
to Goldman Sachs, government debts of Indonesia soared to 98
percent of its GDP in 1999 from 54 percent in 1998; South Korea's
government debts increased to 28 percent of its GDP from 20
percent; and Thailand's government debts grew to 48 percent of its
GDP from 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The main risk is that if countries with deficits continue to
issue more debt, then you have to think carefully about their
ability to service that debt," said Supavud Saicheau, economist at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, any rapid adjustment to balance the budget
could also risk derailing economic recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
While governments are likely to continue their heavy spending
this year to keep recoveries on track, they will have to find
solutions to avoid a debt explosion.
</P>
<P>
But economists said that even if Asian governments start to
trim budget deficits from 2001, the heavy burden of interest
payments will keep government debts rising for several years ahead
in many countries.
</P>
<P>
"We used to be very proud of our fiscal situation in Thailand,
but now it is something we need to be very concerned about," said
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda.
</P>
<P>
For Asian governments, realigning taxes, accelerating
privatization, switching expenditures away from other areas, could
be their options to deal with the massive deficits and surging
debts.
</P>
<P>
But these moves will inevitably affect business confidence,
because many Asian governments have used favorable tax rates, or
even long tax holidays to seek new investments from local and
foreign companies, economists said.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign investments remain the key to Asia's
economic upswing as the region's banking sector is still in the
grip of huge non-performing loans. Therefore, Asian governments
will have to think carefully before making such a decision.
</P>
<P>
However, if governments chose another option -- to print money
to buy government debts, they may face runaway inflation and sharp
currency depreciations, economists warned.
</P>
<P>
Facing the tough choices, Asian governments may have to service
their debts promptly and cut public spending, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they said, if the option is not executed
carefully, Asian countries will risk new economic recessions.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Brazil to Share Presiding Over Mercosur This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Economy Minister
Pedro Malan and his Argentine counterpart Jose Luis Machinea
agreed on Friday that their countries will each preside over the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) for six months this year.
</P>
<P>
They decided in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro that
Argentina will be presiding first.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Argentina are the main participants of Mercosur,
which, founded in 1991, also includes Paraguay and Uruguay.
Bolivia and Chile joined the body later as associated nations.
</P>
<P>
Malan was quoted Saturday by the press as saying that he
discussed with his Argentine counterpart measures for
strengthening Mercosur but put aside problems which could cause
disagreement, such as trade in footwear, sugar and chicken.
</P>
<P>
"Issues of bigger importance were discussed, such as the
creation of a free trade area, the integration of the capital
market and the convergence of macroeconomic policies," said Malan.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest controversies between Brazil and Argentina
exists in the negotiation of an agreement on the motor vehicle
industry.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's motor vehicle industry shrank 33 percent last year
because of the contraction of the market in Brazil, Argentina's
main trade partner.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Biggest Regional Bank to Be Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The state-controlled Bank
of the State of Sao Paulo (Banespa), Brazil's biggest regional
bank, will be auctioned in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange on May 16 ,
said an official privatization notice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The base price for the shares of Banespa will be issued on
April 4 by the Brazilian federal government, which has replaced
the Sao Paulo state government as the bank's controller, said the
notice.
</P>
<P>
Parties interested in the sale, including Brazil's largest
private bank Bradesco and some foreign institutions, such as
Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), BSCH and the U.S. Citibank,
could be provided with strategic information about the bank
between March 2 and May 8.
</P>
<P>
The auction will probably lead to changes in the private
section of Brazil's banking market, since Bradesco may lose its
leadership and any foreign bank could take a leading position
among the four biggest banks in the country.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Romario scored twice and
Edmundo once as Vasco da Gama toppled Manchester United 3-1 in the
World Club Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Without English international midfielder David Beckham and
manager Alex Ferguson, both suspended due to ejections from
Thursday's match against Necaxa, Manchester United's chances were
ended.
</P>
<P>
Romario opened up the scoring for Vasco in the 23rd minute
after Edmundo intercepted a backpass from Manchester defender Gary
Neville. Edmundo cut left to draw goalkeeper Mark Bosnich out,
then sent the ball to Romario who scored.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Neville failed to control a chest trap and
Romario poached the ball before blasting it past Bosnich.
</P>
<P>
But seconds later, Mikael Silvestre fell after intercepting a
ball, Edmundo recovered it and scored before Silvestre could get
back to defend.
</P>
<P>
Manchester finally scored in the 81st minute when Helton
slipped, leaving the goal wide open for Nicky Butt to kick it in.

<HEADLINE> Vialli Gives Up on Premiership Glory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli threw in the towel on his
side's chances of winning the Premiership title after being held
by "a team of scallywags".
</P>
<P>
Vialli went in to the game against Bradford at Valley Parade
knowing his side needed maximum points from this clash and
Wednesday's London derby at home to Spurs if they were to stay in
the Championship hunt.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, however, made the worst possible start after going a
goal down on 59 seconds when Lee Mills headed home his sixth goal
of the season - so ending City's three-match drought. But from
that moment Chelsea dominated the game and went on to have 30 goal
attempts throughout the rest of the match, but only managed to
capitalise on the one - scored by Dan Petrescu.
</P>
<P>
That was thanks to an error in the midfield by Neil Redfearn,
along with the substitution of Roberto Di Matteo for Dennis Wise
just moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Italian pounced on Redfearn's error and sent Petrescu
through for the Romanian to beat the onrushing Matt Clarke with a
deft 57th-minute flick.
</P>
<P>
Either side of that, goalkeeper Clarke had proved City's hero
with a string of fine saves which rightly earned him the man-of-
the-ints adrift of current leaders Leeds.
</P>
<P>
A despondent Vialli conceded: "We are really too far away now
from the leaders to think about winning the title," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be realistic and realise that the gap is too big,
but it's our duty to try and win as many matches as possible
between now and the end of the season," he added.

<P>
LONDON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian international Nwankwo
Kanu has been cleared to play in Arsenal's FA Cup tie against
Leicester City on Sunday, according to a statement issued by the
club on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Thankfully, with the help of the Nigerian High Commission in
London, the club has been successfule in retaining Kanu for
tomorrow's F.A. Cup match against Leicester. He will now be
available for selection," Arsenal said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had earlier accepted defeat in
his battle to keep his striker for the fourth-round tie and
released the Nigerian for international duty at the African
Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian High Commissioner in London, Prince Bola
Ajibola, intervened to resolve the stand-off.
</P>
<P>
He faxed Arsenal vice-chairman Davin, saying: "We've been on
the telephone all day trying to sort this out and we've had a
positive result. Kanu can play. It's been arranged at a very
high level indeed."
</P>
<P>
The tournament starts on January 22 but Nigeria do not play
until the following day and Wenger had hoped to keep Kanu for 24
hours longer than FIFA rules permit.

<HEADLINE> 1,685 Turkish Cypriots Visit Holy Site Across Green Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,685 Turkish Cypriots
crossed the Green Line to the Greek Cypriots-dominated side of
Cyprus to visit the tomb of Hala Sultan, an Islamic Holy site, on
the occasion of the Ramadan Holiday.
</P>
<P>
After completing their registration procedures Sunday morning,
the Turkish Cypriots went to Larnaka by 33 buses, accompanied by U.
N. Peace-Keeping Force units and Greek Cypriot police, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The visitors are scheduled to return to the Turkish Cypriots-
controlled part of Cyprus in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean island
in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
An over 200-kilometer-long "Green Line" has separated the two
parts of the island ever since.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of a goodwill agreement signed between
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash in 1997, Turkish Cypriots are allowed to visit Hala Sultan
tomb on two religious holidays and Greek Cypriots can also tour the
Andreas Monastery in Dipkarpaz in northern Cyprus three times a
year.
</P>
<P>
The division of the island has lasted for more than a quarter of
century and the Cyprus issue has remained unresolved despite years
of on-and-off talks under the auspices of the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Responding to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's renewed call,
Clerides and Denktash held "proximity talks" on the country's
future in New York early December, but which reportedly bore no
tangible results.
