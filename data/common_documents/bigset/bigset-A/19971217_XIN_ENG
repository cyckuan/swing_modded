<HEADLINE> Clinton to Visit U.S. Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton will make a Christmas visit to American troops in
Bosnia next week.
</P>
<P>
The president said on Monday said that his trip is to thank
American troops for the sacrifices they contribute to the peace.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I'm doing is going to Bosnia to thank the
American military personnel for being there and for spending their
Christmas there, and for the sacrifices they've made to bring
peace to Bosnia and to tell them why it's important," Clinton told
reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to leave on Sunday and most likely go to
Tuzla and Sarajevo on Monday to meet U.S. troops and leaders of
the Bosnian federation government, White House spokesman Michael
McCurry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has been with his advisors, thinking about the
future of Bosnia, thinking how much better positioned the future
will be because of the current Stabilization Force mission that's
deployed there," said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman told reporters that no decision has been
made on whether to extend the U.S. mission in Bosnia. But he
reaffirmed that there is "a developing consensus" that an
international presence should be in Bosnia beyond June next year.
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Force (SFOR), including 8,000 American
troops, is scheduled to leave Bosnia next June, but Washington and
its allies are considering a follow-on force beyond the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Asked on Monday if his trip signals his intention to keep
troops in Bosnia, Clinton said: "I'm going to have several
opportunities to talk to you over the next few days and I'll have
a statement about that soon."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been caught between pressure
from Congress wanting a timely pullout and Europeans saying peace
will collapse if all the troops get out.

<HEADLINE> All Six Acquitted in Senna Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 16 (Xinhua) -- An Italian court on Tuesday
acquitted Formula One team chief Frank Williams and five other
defendants of manslaughter in a trial over the death of Brazilian
racing driver Ayrton Senna in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Judge Antonio Costanzo told the court in the northern town of
Imola, where Senna crashed and died in the San Marino Grand Prix
in May 1994, that all six men were acquitted on charges of
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
The five others charged were Williams team technical director
Patrick Head, former chief designer Adrian Newey, Belgian race
director Roland Bruynseraede, Imola race track director Federico
Bendinelli and former track official Giorgio Poggi.
</P>
<P>
The trial began in February and the prosecution alleged a poor
weld on Senna's steering column snapped as the Brazilian race
entered the notorious Tamburello curve, causing him to lose
control of his car and hurtled off the track at 220 kph into a
concrete wall. Senna, three times world champion, died a few hours
later.
</P>
<P>
It was also alleged by the prosecution that the way the track
was maintained could have contributed to the accident. Both
allegations were denied by the defendants.
</P>
<P>
Motor racing's ruling body, the FIA, said it would study
today's verdict before commenting.

<P>
GUILIN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China's publishers are urged to
improve the work of newspapers and periodicals that cater to
children.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of a seven-day national symposium on
children's periodicals, which was attended by more than 40
officials from 20 publishing houses. The symposium ended today in
Guilin in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Current problems for children's periodicals involve circulation
systems, an incomplete market, neglect by officials and the low
status of editors, participants said.
</P>
<P>
While trying to raise the quality of children's periodicals,
publishing houses should also pay attention to adding more special
features of ethnic minorities in the publications, they said.

<HEADLINE> Senator Calls for Hearings on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Senator Tom Harkin is
urging a subcommittee chairman to hold hearings on child labor in
America, citing an Associated Press series on the topic.
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans believe that abusive child labor only occurs in
Asia or South America," Harkins, a Democrat from Iowa said Monday.
"Hearings will help tell the story that this is a problem right
here at home."
</P>
<P>
Harkin, a member of the Senate Labor subcommittee on
employment, formally requested the hearings in a letter to the
panel's chairman, Senator Mike DeWine.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five months, the AP found 165 children working
illegally in 16 states. A Rutgers University labor economist who
analyzed workplace and population data for the series estimated
that 290,200 children were employed unlawfully last year. About
59,600 of them were under age 14 and 13,100 worked in garment
sweatshops, defined as factories with repeated labor violations.
</P>
<P>
Harkin said abusive child labor isn't about teen-agers who work
part time or help out on the family farm.
</P>
<P>
"It's about tens of thousands of children illegally working,
sometimes in hazardous conditions," Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
Harkin said he plans to introduce legislation to fight child
labor. His bill would increase penalties for violators and double
the Labor Department's budget to enforce child labor laws.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Grant Total Foreign Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to grant foreign
investors 100 percent ownership in private companies if a new
draft law is approved.
</P>
<P>
The draft, prepared by Kuwaiti Finance Ministry, will be
submitted to the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly
for approval.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source here today, the draft raises
the proportion of foreign ownership of private companies from the
present maximum of 49 percent to complete control, and exempts
those companies from taxes, in a bid to attract more foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Gulf emirate is striving to diversify its economy
and introduce more sophisticated technologies. Permitting foreign
investors to set up independent, fully-owned companies is regarded
as the first step toward a more open and liberal economy.
</P>
<P>
More steps will be taken to increase foreign investors' shares in
Kuwaiti companies, the source said. But for this end, amendments
to some other existing laws are also required.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government has formed a special committee in charge
of reviewing proposed projects of foreign investors to decide
whether to grant facilities or tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Roudhan said last
month that the existing Tax Law of Kuwait hampering the inflow of
foreign capital has been amended by the ministry and is due to be
endorsed by the cabinet shortly.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti Corporate Law which bans foreigners from
owning shares of Kuwaiti share-holding companies will be amended to
have the ban lifted.

<HEADLINE> China, Republic of Korea Combat Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have
repatriated Korean Lee Sang Ho, who illegally ferried 95 Chinese
citizens into the Republic of Korea (ROK). They have vowed to join
hands with their Korean counterparts to further investigate the
case.
</P>
<P>
In May and July, Korean police sent two official letters to the
China National Bureau of the International Criminal Police
Organization (ICPO-Interpol) seeking cooperation in the case of
Lee Sang Ho.
</P>
<P>
Lee was caught on Aug. 9 in Shanghai soon after he entered the
city.
</P>
<P>
Investigation shows that from February of 1996 to July of 1996,
Lee and two brothers along with an uncle illegally smuggled 95
Chinese citizens into the ROK, charging 35,000 yuan (4,200
U.S. dollars) for each person.
</P>
<P>
His uncle and one brother were caught by ROK police in July of
last year when they were illegally ferrying 36 Chinese citizens
into Korea. Lee then fled Shanghai to Jiangsu Province in east
China, among other places.
</P>
<P>
On June 8 this year, an ROK court signed a warrant and with the
help of Interpol requested that the Chinese arrest Lee.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Public Security pointed
out that Lee's action of organizing illicit immigration for
personal profit violated Chinese law and should be punished.
</P>
<P>
However, the official added, to strengthen cooperation between
the police forces of China and the ROK, Chinese police authorities
repatriated Lee.

</P>
<P>
Jospin will be accompanied by several of his cabinet ministers

France cancelled 400 million francs (67 million U.S. dollars)
of debts owed by Morocco in October and turned other debts into
new loans. It has provided annual aid of one billion franc (17

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen has rejected a congressionally chartered defense
panel's recommendation that the Pentagon abandon its two-war
strategy.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that maintaining a capability... to fight and win
two major theater wars in overlapping time frames remains central
to credibly deterring opportunism and aggression," Cohen said
Monday in a letter to leaders of House and Senate committees that
oversee the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
This was Cohen's formal response to a report issued December 1
by the Congressional National Defense Panel.
</P>
<P>
The panel said that the Cold War era was over and the
probability of the United States facing two major regional wars at
the same time was very low. The U.S. military should change the
strategy and turn its focus on needed improvements.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has been making decisions on the overall size of
the military and its approach to modernizing forces on the basis of
the strategy that U.S. forces should be prepared to fight two
major regional wars at nearly the same time.

ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Acting President of Pakistan
Wasim Sajjad today stressed the need for giving due importance to
the human resources development in member countries of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the OIC Ministerial Standing Committee
on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, Wasim said there was

initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Vigorous and sustained efforts have been made to build a strong
and highly-motivated scientific community in the Muslim world,
said Wasim, adding that high priority is being given to the human
resources development.
</P>
<P>
Wasim said an organization titled "the International Forum for
Science, Technology and Human resources Development" had been
established recently.

The prime objectives of the forum are to foster human resources
among Muslim societies and create facilities and opportunities
among Muslim intellectuals to exchange views, experiences and
expertise, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Pledges Support for Romania's Bid for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today told visiting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu that
Germany would do its best to support the country's bid to join the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made by the EU leaders during their Luxembourg
summit last weekend, Romania was among the 11 countries mainly
from Eastern and Central Europe which had been invited to join the
15-nation EU.
</P>
<P>
However, other than Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Slovenia and Cyprus, with which the EU would begin
membership talks early next year, Romania and other four nations
were placed on a slower negotiating track to enable them to make
further efforts to meet entry conditions.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the EU decision bears the concrete prospect for
Romania's admission into the EU, Kohl told Constantinescu that
Germany would make all possible contributions to help the country
meet the conditions for membership negotiations with the EU as
soon as possible, German government spokesman Peter Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu, who started a three-day visit to Germany today,
also met German President Roman Herzog this morning. He is also
scheduled to address German business leaders in Bonn before
visiting Munich and Hamburg.

<HEADLINE> NATO FMs Meet to Do Year-End Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation foreign ministers met here Tuesday to ponder possible
future NATO missions in Bosnia, and review the progress their
alliance made during the past year.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana, said that the North
Atlantic Council meeting at foreign ministerial level first
discussed the issue of Bosnia and then that of NATO internal and
external adaptations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most interesting topic was the
political-military guidance to be given to NATO military
authorities for planning the mission after the current United
Nations peace-keeping mandate for Bosnia expires next June.
</P>
<P>
The military authorities will possibly start planning a
post-SFOR force in Bosnia with the guidance.
</P>
<P>
But the secretary general said that a final decision is not
expected until March 1 next year -- after thorough considerations
of the current situation in Bosnia during January and February.
</P>
<P>
All NATO foreign ministers, according to Solana, agreed that
Tuesday was a significant moment for the western military alliance
in that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were slated to sign
their protocols of accession later in the day after the foreign
minister meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that all the foreign ministers praised the
progress the three invitee countries had made during the accession
talks which lasted a little more than two months from September to
early November.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Solana described 1997 as a truly remarkable
year in the history of the military alliance in that the meetings
held earlier in the year had laid the foundation of an inwardly
and outwardly renewed NATO.
</P>
<P>
"The new NATO is ready to meet the challenges of the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Turkish row with the European Union (EU)
would eventually spill over to affect inter-NATO relations, Solana
said the Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem had made it clear at
the meeting that NATO and the European Union are two different
institutions.
</P>
<P>
"In no case will the internal and external adaptation will be
affected," said Solana at a post-meeting press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Turkish foreign minister told the press
that the EU's decision on not inviting his nation to join was a
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Cem said: "The EU summit decision, on a certain point, was
unfair, sometimes biased and sometimes with the connotation of
double standards. Sometimes it was based on exaggerated
allegations."
</P>
<P>
The European Union at its last weekend summit in Luxembourg
decided to invite Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Slovenia and Cyprus to start accession talks early next year.
</P>
<P>
Five other nations -- Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and
Slovakia -- were put on a slower negotiating track by the
15-nation union, leaving Turkey, a long-time applicant for 34
years, completely in the cold.
</P>
<P>
After hearing two reports on the latest developments in Bosnia,
the NATO foreign ministers discussed four options concerning the
possible follow-on force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The options ranged from total withdrawal of the NATO-led
stabilization force to a deterrent force with different force
levels and with different military tasking, according to a NATO
official.
</P>
<P>
A NATO-led ground force was described by the official as a
compliment and not a supplement to the United Nations
International Police Task Force (IPTF).
</P>
<P>
But no figures were discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The size of the follow-on force was to be decided by the NATO
Military Committee, said the official who asked not to be
named.

WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- After the President of Iran's conciliatory remarks toward
the United States, President Clinton said he "would like nothing
better than to have a dialogue with Iran," but that his
administration was still committed to isolating the country as
punishment for a series of unacceptable activities.
</P>
<P>
-- The chief prosecutor of he Balkan war-crimes tribunal
complained to officials in Paris that war-crimes suspects in the
French-patrolled zone of Bosnia could feel "perfectly safe"because
French peacekeepers did not even try to pursue them. French
officials rejected the allegations and said their troops followed
NATO directives.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Moving to end a political stalemate over affirmative action,
President Clinton Monday installed Bill Lann Lee in the Justice
Department's top civil rights post on an acting basis instead of
waiting for the outcome of a confirmation battle that
administration officials acknowledged Lee had little prospect of
winning.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon announced plans Monday to vaccinate all U.S.
military personnel against anthrax bacteria, marking the first
time that American troops will receive routine inoculations
against a germ warfare agent. The decision by Defense Secretary
william S. Cohen followed several years of internal Pentagon
argument over the need for the vaccine and the best way of
administering it to U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea let the won float against the dollar Tuesday and
said it may issue bonds to raise money overseas. The country's
currency and stock markets rebounded strongly. but the permanence
of the won's comeback remains uncertain: Investors may be
disappointed by Thursday's presidential election because the three
main candidates and the government have flip-flopped repeatedly on
policy in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party leaked a draft of a
plan to stabilize the country's teetering financial system that
includes the injection of 77 billion dollars in public money. But
the plan will give bureaucrats wide powers of discretion over how
that money is used.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes to Iron out Differences with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today the Egyptian-Iranian relations which are now witnessing
positive signs have yet to see significant development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters while touring the Obour city, east of
capital Cairo, the president said "nothing happened" except the
fact that Foreign Minister Amr Moussa visited Iran
recently. Moussa attended the eighth Islamic summit in Tehran on
December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed hope for improving bilateral ties. "I
hope existing differences would be eliminated as Egypt is keen on
sharing good ties with all countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first public reaction from Mubarak to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami's optimistic remarks that "the most
appropriate climate" for better Iranian-Arab relations has been
created.
</P>
<P>
"The two major countries on the Islamic arena are Iran and
Egypt and nothing should stand between their relationship,"
Khatami told a press conference in Tehran on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami hoped that through dialogue, Iran could "get closer to
our Egyptian brother, restore relations and set all our
differences aside."
</P>
<P>
Iran cut off ties with Egypt after it signed peace with Israel
in 1979. Presently represented only by interest sections at each
other's capital, the two countries have yet to resume full
diplomatic relations.

</P>
<P>
Musonda explained that the profit recorded in the year under
review is achieved aginst an environment of intensive credit
review, high inflation and stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the profit to the bank's restructuring program
under which about 1,000 employees, 42 percent of the total, were
laid off and the conditions of service for the remaining
employees have been improved.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bad performance of the country's weakened
manufacturing and industrial sectors also impacts adversely on
the bank's performance.
</P>
<P>
Musonda also disclosed that the bank's capital still remains
above!the stipulated 2 billion Kwacha (about 1.5 million dollars)
required by the Bank of Zambia to operate a commercial bank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Increase 0.8 percent in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nation-wide
housing starts surged 0.8 percent in November to the highest level
in nine months this year, the Commerce Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
Construction of new homes and apartments totaled 1.53 million
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from a revised 1.52
million in October, according to the department. The October rate
originally was estimated to be 1.53 million.
</P>
<P>
It was the strongest pace since a 1.55 million rate in February
and the first time in nearly nine years it remained above 1.5
million for three consecutive months. The September rate was 1.51
million.
</P>
<P>
Some market analysts had predicted a drop to a 1.49 million
rate in November. However, housing starts during the first 11
months of 1997 remained 1.1 percent below those of the same period
last year. For all of 1996, starts totaled 1.48 million, an
eight-year high.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that housing construction remains strong due
to job and income growth and mortgage rates near a two-year low.
</P>
<P>
A builders association survey in early December suggests that
housing will remain strong into 1998. The Housing Market Index
pegged to the survey rose to 59 from 56 in November, also showing
optimism about prospects for next year.
</P>
<P>
But applications for building permits, another barometer of
future housing construction activity, slipped 2.6 percent in
November to a 1.45 million rate from 1.49 million a month earlier.
It was the biggest decline since a 3 percent drop in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Single-family starts, which are sensitive to mortgage rates,
rebounded 2.5 percent to a 1.17 million rate after falling 3.6
percent in October. They represent about 80 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, construction of apartments and condominiums, fell
4.2 percent to 365,000, failed to keep up the 16.9 percent pace
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the 41 percent starts surge in the Northeast, to a
165,000 rate, reversed October's 16.4 percent drop. The 9.2
percent advance in the West boosted the rate to 416,000, highest
since 418,000 in February 1996. However, those gains were offset
by a 13.7 percent decline in the Midwest, to a 270,000 rate, and a
4 percent decrease in the South, to 680,000.

<HEADLINE>   NATO: Three Prospects Sign Accession Protocols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Solana said: "Today's ceremony is a profound sign of NATO's
transformation and how far we have overcome the divisions of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We are setting the tone for the new millennium -- a tone of
confidence and optimism for all the peoples of our Euro-Atlantic
area."
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that the western military alliance was very
different from the one of the first 40 years of its existence.
</P>
<P>
"No longer are we threatened by a confrontational East-West
divide. No longer are we subject to a threatening arms race," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the accession protocols came at the end of
two-months of accession talk from September to early November.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that the three prospects had firmly committed
themselves to meeting the obligations and responsibilities under
the Washington Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"You have expressed your wish to participate in NATO's new
military structure and you have undertaken to carry out the
necessary reforms," he added.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said at the signing
ceremony: "For over two hundred years, when foreign leaders put
their signatures under documents concerning Poland, disasters were
sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I am to witness Poland's friends sign a document which
is a source of joy, pride and hope for me and my compatriots."
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs said that the signing
of accession protocols is a milestone both in the process of
Hungary's Euro-Atlantic integration and in the enlargement of NATO
that greatly contributes to the emergence of a new united Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Hungary considers the enlargement as a historic step that will
expand the zone of stability and security to the benefit of all
the countries of the Euro-Atlantic region," said Kovacs.
</P>
<P>
The 16-nation alliance decided to invite the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland to start accession procedings at its Madrid
summit. Prior to the summit, however, Romania and Slovenia had
been hailed as possible candidates for the first wave of NATO
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Solana gave reassurances time and again after the Madrid summit
that the door of NATO remained open to other potential candidates
and NATO's enlargement would not be confined by geographical
division, but rather would be gauged by common values and
interests.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- World output is
estimated to have grown 3.2 percent in 1997 from 3 percent in
1996, and a growth of 3 percent is forecast for 1998, United
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil in some Asian countries is expected to
"result in an inflexion in world economic growth, with the
slow-down in the more seriously affected countries and its impact
on their major trading partners being partially offset by
strengthened momentum elsewhere," the Department said.
</P>
<P>
It said per capita output in 1998 is expected to increase in 131
of 143 countries regularly monitored by the U.N., compared to 120
countries in 1997 and 67 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Developed economies are expected to expand 2.6 percent in 1997,
against 2.4 percent in 1996 and 2.5 percent is forecast for 1998.,
the Department said in its annual report The World Economy at the
Beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The major features of developed economies in 1997 are the
relative weakness of Japanese and strength of the United States
economies, with the U.S. estimated to expand 3.7 percent and Japan
to grow 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Developing economies are to maintain the 1996 growth pace of
5.7 percent in 1997, with a 5 percent predicted for 1998.
</P>
<P>
African GDP is to go up 3 percent in 1997, less than 4.4
percent in 1996 while a 4 percent growth is forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean is to reach 5.2
percent in 1997, higher than 3.7 percent in 1996 while the 1998
figure is forecast to slow to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
East and Southeast Asian economies excluding China is estimated
to grow 6.5 percent in 1997 against 7.4 percent in 1996 and a 6.25
percent is forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 largest developing economies, China is estimated
to grow 9.3 percent in 1997 compared to 9.7 percent in 1996 and a
further 10 percent growth is forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Economies in transition are estimated to have grown as a whole
in 1997 for the first time since the cease of central planning
regimes, with a growth of 0.5 percent in Russia which is forecast
to further grow 1.5 percent in 1998, the report said.
</P>
<P>
For the whole economies in transition, figures are listed as
1.7 percent for 1997, minus 0.3 for 1996 and 3.25 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said world trade staged a major recovery from its
sharp growth slow-down of 5.3 percent in 1996 with estimated
growth of 9.4 percent for 1997 and 7 percent forecast for 1998.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year
inflation has risen to 19.4 percent for November, up 3.4
percentage point from the previous month, the Central Statistical
Office (CSO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The Discount House of Zimbabwe said the payment of former
freedom fighters gratuities and pensions as well as the recent
announced increase in the rediscount rate from 28.5 to 31.5
percent to control the run away money supply, continued to exert
pressures on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Raising the rediscount rate was not the solution to the
current economic woes, unless the government first resolves the
economic fundamentals, the rate of inflation would reach
unprecedented levels, it said.

<HEADLINE> Developed Economies to Grow Steadily: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in the
developed countries is proceeding at a relatively steady rate with
GDP having risen by 3 percent or more in 11 countries in 1997, a
report of the United Nations said today.
</P>
<P>
The countries listed are Australia, Canada, Finland, Greece,
Ireland, Malta, the netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Britain and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Four countries namely France, Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden
are expected to join the group in 1998 while Britain and the
United States are expected to see their growth rates drop to
about 2.5 percent, the U.N. Department of Economic and Social
Affairs said in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
The World Economy at the Beginning of 1998 said developed
economies have undergone persisted or strengthened growth with
little inflation but with concern about limited progress in
reducing unemployment and Japan's difficulty in returning to solid
growth.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices in the developed economies rose only 2 percent
on average in 1997, a record low since 1961. The average is
forecast to remain at 2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said the continuing economic expansion is not
expected to have more than a modest impact on unemployment in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is expected to see its sixth consecutive
year of double-digit unemployment, with the 1997 figure standing
at 10.5 percent against 10.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which has undergone six years of economic growth
averaging only 1 percent a year, is forecast to enter a weak
recovery path in 1998, "although even this is uncertain", said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Japan, estimated to score a 0.8 percent growth in 1997 and
forecast to go up 1.25 percent in 1998, is some important trading
partners in Asia, which would further depress Japanese exports,
the report added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Unions Threaten Another National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) today gave the government an open-ended ultimatum
to immediately scrap the recently imposed increase on sales tax
or face another devastating nationwide mass action by workers.
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Harare to review last Tuesday's unprecendented
national stayaway by workers, the General Council of ZCTU
resolved that "we will go back to the streets" if the 2.5 percent
increase on sales tax is not scrapped immediately.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU also wants Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa and
police commissioner Augustine Chihuri to resign from their
positions immediately as a conditon for workers not to go again
on strike.
</P>
<P>
Last week the ZCTU led mass demonstrations by workers
throughout the country protesting against arbitrary increases by
the government in taxes on fuel, electricity and goods and
services to raise revenue to finance payment of the former
freedom fighters' gratuities and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The increases on fuel and electricity have since been dropped
as well as a proposed five percent war veterans levy on
individual taxpayers and companies. But the sales tax increase
still remains.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU president Gibson Sibanda said, "if that remaining sales
tax increase is not removed without further delay we will be back
in the streets."

<HEADLINE> NATO Signs Accession Protocols With Three Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO foreign ministers, in
the presence of their counterparts from the Czech Republic,
Hungary and Poland, today signed the protocols of accession to the
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said at the signing
ceremony that the signing of the accession protocols had set the
tone for the western military alliance for the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
NATO will become one with new missions, new partners and new
structures, said the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time that NATO expanded in its 48-year
history. Greece, Germany and Spain joined NATO in the previous
three accession moves respectively.
</P>
<P>
The signed protocols will first be ratified by the parliaments
of the 16 NATO member states early next year and will then be
ratified by the parliaments of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland prior to April 1999 when the trio can expect to become full
members of the alliance.
</P>

MAPUTO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Felicio Zacarias, governor of
Mozambican central province Manica has denied border disputes
between his province and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
According to a report today by the Mozambique News Agency, the
governor made the statement on Sunday at a press conference held
in Sussundenga, Manica.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, both Eduardo Gimo, chief of Mossurize county in the
province, and Jose Amoda, the county's frontier commander said
some Zimbabwean farmers had been destroying or moving boundary
markers in an attempt to expand their farm land to the Mozambican
inland for planting tea, coffee and eucalyptus.
</P>
<P>
This is only an individual incident, Zacarias said, adding "I
don't think there are any actual border disputes between the two
countries in the Mossurize area."
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will restore the boundary tablet and
order in the region, since "there are still maps to resort to and
to clear the fact," Zacarias added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the issue could also be referred to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation for settlement.
</P>
<P>
There is a border line of 150 km between Mossurize county,
Mozambique and Chipinga county, Zimbabwe. People living along
the border have long enjoyed friendly economic and trade ties.

<HEADLINE> East Asian Summit Reaches Consensus on Issues: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that leaders at the
informal summit between ASEAN and China, Japan and South Korea and
that between ASEAN and China had reached consensus on a number of
issues.
</P>
<P>
The leaders shared the view that peace, development and
cooperation have become the main trend in the region, Qian told a
press conference he held here at the end of the summits today.
</P>
<P>
The consensus among East Asian countries is to maintain
long-term peace and stability, vitalize the nations through
economic and technological development and enjoy joint prosperity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 12 countries agreed to further strengthen
cooperation in the economic and financial fields and in

</P>
<P>
Qian said Chinese President Jiang Zemin put forth the
principles governing cooperation in East Asia, namely, mutual
respect, equal participation, mutual benefit and joint
development.
</P>
<P>
"We should intensify economic and technological cooperation,
especially hi-tech cooperation, set up a rational economic
structure in the region and bring about a non-exclusive and
non-discriminative model of economic cooperation which can help
countries make up for their deficiencies by drawing upon others'
advantages and strike a balance among different interests," he
quoted Jiang as saying. "We should engage in friendly dialogues
and consultations to build up confidence, broaden agreement, seek
common ground while putting aside differences, address differences
properly so as to ensure regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that in the joint statement issued after their
meeting, President Jiang and the ASEAN leaders laid out the
guidelines for bilateral relations and he called this joint
statement an important achievement of the China-ASEAN summit.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang also had fruitful talks with the ASEAN leaders on
how to promote concrete cooperation in economic, trade and
technological fields, to which the leaders agreed to give priority
in order to turn the potential of the mutually beneficial
cooperation into the reality of joint development.

<HEADLINE> French PM Calls Charges of International Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today called the charges against France made recently by
the general prosecutor of International Tribunal hearing
war-crimes in Bosnia as "unacceptable" and "scandalous"".
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Canadian Louise Arbour, said in interviews with
French press recently that the Serb war criminal suspects feel
"absolutely safe" in the zone under the control of French troops
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
She also accused France of refusing to cooperate by banning
French officers from making testimonies at the hearings of the
Hague-based tribunal.
</P>
<P>
When answering a question at the National Assembly, Jospin said
that France is "resolved" to see to it that no war criminals in
Bosnia escape justice and that all war crimes be punished.
</P>
<P>
"France is resolved to work in this direction, with its allies
and the prosecutors of the TPI (International Tribunal)," she
said, adding that France is ready to discuss with Arbour the
methods of cooperation "on the basis of a relationship of
confidence."
</P>
<P>
But he said that France will not accept "being designated
unjustly to public criticism."
</P>
<P>
French troops serving in the NATO Stabilization Force are in
charge of southeastern division of Bosnia, one of the three
sectors separately under the control of French, American and
British troops.
</P>
<P>
The French section includes Sarajevo and Mostar, as well as a
part of the Serb-controlled area, where live two men most searched
by the International Tribunal, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and former commander of Bosnian Serb force, Ratko Mladic.

<HEADLINE> Current Account Deficits to Fall in Some East Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- With stronger exports
and slower import growth due to higher local currency prices of
imports, the current account deficits in some East Asian nations
are expected to shrink, a U.N. report said today.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit in Thailand is forecast to fall to
about 3 percent of GDP in 1998, against 8 percent in 1996 and the
figure for Malaysia is estimated at 6 percent in 1997 and forecast
at 3 percent in 1998, the World Economy at the Beginning of 1998
said.
</P>
<P>
The annual report, launched by the United Nations Department of
Economic and Social Affairs, said the smaller deficits in
Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines are expected
to be reduced further.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and ROK are struggling to
get rid of the impact of the financial turmoil under an
international rescue package which has surpassed 100 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Thailand's economy is estimated to
fall 1.5 percent in 1997 against a growth of 6.4 percent in 1996,
with 1998 forecast to see a 2 percent recovery.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is to have a 6 percent growth in 1997, compared to
7.8 percent in 1996 and 3.5 percent forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
ROK is to go up 6 percent in 1997 compared to 7.1 percent in
1996 and 3 percent predicted for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The currency depreciations forced by the financial markets have
been helping the region to rebuild the export competitiveness
which some countries had lost.
</P>
<P>
The trend might raise fears that adjustment will come at the
expense of workers in developed countries who will not be able to
compete with the new low-cost imports, the report noted, adding that
some developed nations might even raise protectionist barriers to
these imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Department said this fear seems exaggerated,
especially in the developed nations where employment has been
growing strongly.

wooing the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) for a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
The IFP was the only opposition party to be spared from
Mandela's attacks at the 50th national conference of the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said in his presidential speech that opposition
parties, non-governmental organizations and the media, even some
ANC members have formed a "counter-revolutionary" network to
derail South Africa's democratic process and development.
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC and the IFP, the biggest black opposition,
should not allow issues they disagreed on to stand in the way of
cooperation to achieve the "genuine emancipation of our people."
</P>
<P>
"Further, our two organizations are involved in a joint effort
to consolidate peace in the country and to encourage a culture of
tolerance and non-violent political competition among our
respective members and supporters."
</P>
<P>
More fundamentally, he noted, the two organizations had a
responsibility to cooperate to ensure the objectives of the
Reconstruction and Development program were achieved.
</P>
<P>
"We share the same constituency, especially the rural and
urban poor," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Lionel Mtshali, the IFP representative to the conference, was
the only person Mandela welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said there were good people in all political
organizations and that one of them was Mtshali, who is the first
IFP representative ever sent to an ANC national conference.
</P>
<P>
Mtshali was sent in after IFP leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
declined a personal invitation from ANC Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The ANC and the IFP were involved in a bitter struggle in the
1980s and early 1990s and clashes between them caused more than
20,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said in a televised interview on Sunday that the ANC
would welcome a merger with the IFP as a very progressive
development, because South Africans needed to speak with one
voice.
</P>
<P>
He had held talks with Buthelezi on the question of unity on
several occasions, and would be happy if Buthelezi were offered
the position of deputy president.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still not known whether the proposal will be
accepted by the IFP.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said earlier this month that his party wanted to be
at peace with the ANC.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford divisions and we must realize that in
the end, if our country is to succeed, we must stand together,
failing which we are doomed to fall together," the IFP leader
said at the launch of 31 new IFP branches.
</P>
<P>
But the IFP said Monday that it had not been approached
officially by the ANC on a merger and that it was not considering
this matter because it was busy preparing for the 1999 general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition parties unanimously attacked the idea of an
ANC-IFP merger, saying that would give the ANC too much power and
would eventually lead South Africa to a one-party state.

<HEADLINE> OIC Urges More Greater Cooperation Among Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) were urged today to
further strengthen cooperation in science and technology for the
benefit of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative for the OIC countries to join hands in the
field of science and technology to face the challenges of the 21st
century, said participants of the Eighth Meeting of the OIC
Standing Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, opened here today by Pakistan's Acting President
Wasim Sajjad, is attended by delegates from 12 Muslim countries,
according to the official Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The participants noted that technology is one of the most
critical factors in facilitating and promoting economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Muslim countries should move away from simple import of
consumer goods and toward enhancing production capabilities
through technology transfer, they said.
</P>
<P>
They said that in technology transfer, priority should be given
to acquiring latest technologies, know-how and the capability to
adapt technology to needs and develop it further to achieve the
intentional competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
They called on the OIC member countries to work together to
achieve qualitative excellence in science and technology and thus
survive with dignity and honor in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also proposed to create an International
Scientific and Technical Center for Oil and Gas for the benefit of
the member countries.

<HEADLINE> Global Car Production Forecast to Rise 3 Per Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) - Despite financial crisis in
ASEAN countries, car production all over the world in 1997 is
forecast to rise an impressive 3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The increase is driven by the "Italian effect" in Europe, the
continued strong growth in Latin America and Eastern Europe and an
export-led rise in Japanese output, according to the World Car
Industry Forecast Report.
</P>
<P>
However, the report by Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI said that Growth
in global car production is expected to slow down in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Western European car production is likely to outperform the car
market in 1998, with strong stock build and export growth
following a record year for new model activity.
</P>
<P>
Although the European market is still some 200,000 units below
its all time peak, the European export base has expanded
significantly and imports are much lower than in the early 1990's.
</P>
<P>
In North America, total light vehicle production is forecast to
reach 15.4 million units this year. While U.S. sales are expected
to be flat this year, stronger demand in Canada and Mexico will
keep production humming along.
</P>
<P>
Japanese car output is benefiting from boosts in exports thanks
to a weaker yen, new product activity and healthy overseas playing
fields.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian car production for the first ten months of the year
is estimated to be 19 per cent higher than last year. Argentina is
matching Brazil's export growth. Auto makers continue to announce
new investment plans in the region.

<HEADLINE> Cypriots Urged to Keep Cool by UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Resident Representative
in Cyprus Gustave Feissel today urged the Cypriots to keep cool
following a European Union (EU) decision on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides, Feissel said they reviewed the current
developments relating to Cyprus following the EU decision to go
ahead with Cyprus' accession talks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his adherence to the primary objective of solving
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU on Saturday decided to begin accession talks with Cyprus
in March and rejected Turkey as a candidate for EU membership.
This move has angered Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said Monday the
inter-communal talks of Cyprus are "dead," and that he will no
longer discuss the subject with the U.N. and the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative said Denktash is "upset" by the EU
decision, pointing out that "we have to keep our eye on the ball,
that is to solve the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Survey Indicates Most Britons Remain Opposed to EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the British
people remained opposed to joining the European single currency,
according to a survey released today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Royal Institute of International
Affairs (RIAA), revealed that six out of 10 people polled
expressed opposition to the European Monetary Union (EMU) due to
be formally launched in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among the 1,400 people survey, the RIAA report said: "Sixty-one
percent oppose British membership of a single currency, with
opposition fairly consistent across age groups, regions and party
identification."
</P>
<P>
"While this opposition undoubtedly reflects sovereignty
concerns, there are also fears that membership would increase
unemployment and result in EU tax policies," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report also pointed out that Britain would
eventually lose its influence in Europe unless it joined the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
"European Union policies and institutions will change radically
over the next 15 years as a result of enlargement and Britain can
and should play an influential role," the RIAA report said.
</P>
<P>
"Britain will lose influence unless it joins EMU by 2002. It
should act to ensure the right conditions exist to do so," the
report added.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Price Forecast to Be Influenced by Saudi Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices in 1998 is
expected to depend mainly on the level of Saudi Arabian oil
production next year, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by the London-based Center for Global Energy
Studies (CGES), the newspaper said that the price of oil in 1998
"will depend crucially on the Kingdom's output stance".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as a result of the recent decision by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost output by
10 percent, the Kingdom will be able to increase its production
from eight million barrels a day to 8.7 million b/d on January 1,
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the big question is that no one knows whether Saudi
Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, will insist on producing
up to its quota ceiling or it will trim its output to prevent
prices from crashing.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited another report by the Oxford Institute for
Energy Studies as saying that Saudi Arabia has relatively little
financial room to manoeuvre as its finances will be undermined by
a relatively small slide in average oil prices in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that only a 1.65 U.S. dollars fall in average oil
prices next year will make Saudi Arabia to reap no financial
benefit from its increased output, and any bigger fall will result
in lower export earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- France, Britain and Germany will
build a military satellite telecommunications system baptized
"Trimilsatcom" which is expected to enter service in 2005, the
French armament authorities, Delegation Generale pour Armement
(DGA), said today.
</P>
<P>
The three-nation joint project is aimed at replacing the
Syracus 2 telecommunications system of the French armed forces and
the Skynet system of the British royal armed forces, said DGA.
</P>
<P>
A protocol of agreement has been signed by the three nations on
the project, which is expected to cost 13 billion francs (2.2
billion U.S. dollars) and has been planned for several years.
</P>
<P>
The French Alcatel Alsthom telecommunications group and the
British-French group Matra Marconi Space are designated by the
three governments to elaborate their technical and financial
proposals on the project in two years' time.
</P>
<P>
The type and number of the satellites for the future system are
unknown yet, but the Trimilsatcom is most likely to be based on
several big geostationary satellites so that France and Britain
can continue to use their networks of ground satellite stations,
said experts.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Provide 18,000 Tons of Food for Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) will provide 18,000 tons of food in the next six months for
more than 600,000 Somalis hit by flood.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here today, WFP said that flood
victims would need about 30,000 tons of food to survive from
January to July when the next harvest was due.
</P>
<P>
The balance of the needs are expected to be met from food
stocks already in the pipeline for an on-going Somalia emergency
operation, the release added.
</P>
<P>
WFP estimated that the heavy rain beginning from the second
half of October had destroyed 31,000 tons of household food
reserves and expected crops.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted WFP agronomist Renato Murai as saying that
"these people have lost everything and have nothing to turn to
but food aid."
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains in the past two months have caused
flooding along the Shebelle and Jubba, two main rivers in the
Horn of African country.
</P>
<P>
A recent report by relief agencies said that more than 1,800
people have been killed and 230,000 rendered homeless by floods
duing the past two months in the country which has a population
of some six million.
</P>
<P>
As the floods began just after farmers had planted the Deyr
crop which is expected to be harvested in January, WFP
anticipated total crop failure in the country, especially in the
southern part.
</P>
<P>
WFP noted that "what is even more frightening is that the
seasonal rains in April could set off more flooding because the
flood waters may not have reduced sufficiently, and the damaged
embankments will not yet be repaired."
</P>
<P>
Somalia has no central government since Said Barre was ousted
in January 1991 and is ruled by a number of clan-based militia
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Reopens Airport, Demanding ECOMOG to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government has
reopened the Robertsfield International Airport and
demanded the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to move
military equipment away.
</P>
<P>
The airport, one of the largest in west Africa located 40 km from
Monrovia, the Liberian capital, was seriously damaged during the civil
war and closed since July 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was later turned into a military base of ECOMOG, whose jet
fighters over the past several months took off for neighboring Sierra
Leone to launch waves on the military junta there.
</P>
<P>
With the official reopening of the airport to commercial
airlines, the Liberian government has changed its policy towards
the presence of ECOMOG, the British Broadcasting Corporation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony to celebrate the reopening Monday, Liberia's
Vice-President asked ECOMOG to move its military equipment out of the
newly renovated airport in order to create a more attractive
environment for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG removal would help create confidence of businessmen
hoping to resume flights to Liberia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement is seen to clearly buttress an earlier commitment by
President Charles Taylor when he took exception to ECOMOG using
Liberian soil as a base from which to pressurize the Sierra Leonean
junta to relinquish power.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the Ghana Airways attending Monday's reopening
ceremony said it would make its flight this Friday.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Unemployed Hold Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of laid-off workers
in Israel today staged protests against unemployment in the
southern town of Ofakim, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Angry workers burnt tires, blocked roads and clashed with the
police, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal employees of the town also joined the
demonstration protesting against delayed payment of their wages of
last month.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came after the release of national
statistical figures Monday, which showed that 14.3 percent of the
residents of Ofakim are out of work, the highest rate in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In response to the demonstration, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today appointed a committee to deal with rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He assured a solution to Ofakim's unemployment problem in 30
days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition parties demanded that budget
deficit be increased to combat unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz Party had presented to the Israeli Knesset
(parliament) a no-confidence motion against the Likud government
over the unemployment issue.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Israeli Trade Union Amir Peretz had said he would
lead an unwavering battle against unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to establish an emergency fund
with 1 percent of the national budget, or 1 billion shekels (about
290 million U.S. dollars), to fight unemployment.

<HEADLINE> World Trade Growth to Slow Down to 7 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- World trade, estimated
to stage a surge of 9.4 percent in 1997 from 5.3 percent in 1996,
is forecast to slow down to a growth of 7 percent in 1998,
according to a U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
The annual report of the World Economy at the Beginning of 1998
released today by the United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs said the trend largely reflects changes in the trade
growth of developed economies which make up over two thirds of
world trade.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 upturn was very much occasioned by the double digit
growth of imports of the United States fed by the strong growth of
incomes and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, it said, adding
that there was also some modest pick up in imports in Japan and
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, import volume is estimated to have grown about 10
percent or more in Canada and Australia, in several Latin American
countries particularly Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela,
in Poland and in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Asian economies also provided their traditionally strong intake
of imports mainly in the first half of the year for East Asian
countries. while African imports grew at a moderate pace.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the growth of world import demand is forecast to be
more evenly spread, with the U.S. import surge slowing, while
Japan's import growth slowly increases.
</P>
<P>
Slow import growth in East Asia and Latin America will not be
matched by more sharply rising imports into China and India, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with slower increase in imports in Africa, the growth
of developing country imports is forecast to decelerate to a rate
of 7.25 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Major developed economies are expected to face export slowdown
in the adjusting Asian economies' markets where currency
depreciations are to help local export drive.
</P>
<P>
The dollar index of the prices of non-fuel commodity exports
by developing countries fell by almost 1 percent in the first three
quarters of 1997 and the general trend is expected to continue in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices declined by about 8 percent in 1997, averaging
about 18.5 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Barring major supply disruptions and assuming Iraq continues to
export oil as in 1997, oil prices in 1998 are expected to remain
within a range of 17 to 20 dollars a barrel, averaging about 18
dollars a barrel for the year, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Vows to Remove Corrupt Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian president Benjamin
 Mkapa said today that all corrupt elements in the police force should be
removed and made to suffer from their evil deeds.
</P>
<P>
"By making the corrupt officials pay heavily for their deeds,
every one in the police force will know that the practice is not
unprofitable, and its costs unbearable, " Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the annual conference for commanders at the police college
in Moshi, the president said he repeatedly spoke against
corruption because the scourge threatens the survival of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption leads to miscarriage of justice," he said, adding that
people may be forced to lost their rights.
</P>
<P>
When the police, an institution where people turn for justice
also becomes corrupt, then the public will lose confidence in the
government, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said he is pleased to learn that efforts have already made
to cleanse the force, with some officials sacked in connection
with corruption and other malpractices.
</P>
<P>
The president urged officials in the police force to work closely
with the authorities, like the Prevention of Corruption Bureau (PCB), the
Permanent Commission of Enquiry, the Controller and Auditor General
and the Chief Government Verifier.
</P>
<P>
The PCB Acting Director of Research, Training and Public Education,
Augustine Buluda, told reporters last weekend that corruption is
rampant in most government institutions. He said the judiciary is on
the top list of corrupt institutions followed by the police force.
</P>
<P>
The government has flexed its muscles in combating
corruption over the past two years. PCB, in collaboration with other
institutions, has recovered 1.5 billion shillings (about 2.4 million
US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Meets Chinese Leader Wei Jianxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral met here today with Wei Jianxing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and member of the
Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Wei said that as the two most populous
developing countries in the world, China and India have much more
common interests than differences.
</P>
<P>
To maintain stable, long-term good-neighborly relations and
friendship between China and India is not only in the fundamental
interests of the two countries but also conducive to peace,
stability and development in Asia and the world as a whole, Wei
said.
</P>
<P>
Wei came here on Sunday for a nine-day goodwill visit at the
invitation of Indian Vice-President Krishna Kant.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the Indian government's principled stand that
there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable
part of Chinese territory while Tibet is an autonomous region of
China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sino-Indian economic and trade ties, Wei pointed
out that the improvement of political relations has provided a
favorable environment for further increasing exchanges in the
fields of economy and trade, culture, and science and technology
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said Indian-Chinese relations have made progress in both
quality and quantity following President Jiang Zemin's visit to
India last year which opened a new chapter in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that India and China should deepen mutual
understanding and strengthen friendship for the future of the two
countries and for peace, stability and development in Asia and the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also reiterated the Indian government's
principled stand on Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
As to the situation in South Asia, Gujral said his country is
willing to improve relations with all neighboring countries
including Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that because both India and Pakistan are China's
friendly neighbors, China sincerely hopes that Indian-Pakistani
relations will be further improved and peace and stability
maintained in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, Wei also met with some other Indian
leaders including opposition party leader Atal Behari Vajpayee,
Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) Speaker P. A.
Sangma and Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri to discuss
issues of mutual concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott described here today the Kyoto agreement on tackling
climate change as a "political breakthrough".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at British parliament on the UN conference on global
climate held in Kyoto, Japan, last week, Prescott said the final
agreement "demonstrated beyond doubt that genuine political will
did exist in all these countries, and a political breakthrough was
achieved".
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a cut of over five percent in greenhouse
gas emissions would be made by the developed countries by 2010
compared with 1990.
</P>
<P>
Prescott, head of British delegation at the Kyoto conference,
said: "I believe that Kyoto will be remembered in future as the
place where the world, in a United Nations forum, faced a crucial
decision and made the right choice."
</P>
<P>
Prescott stressed that Britain, due to take over the European
Union (EU) presidency early next year, faced a new challenge in
ensuring that the 15-nation bloc agrees to greenhouse gas emission
targets for each EU member.

LAGOS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign reserves has risen
to the current level of 7.5 billion U.S. Dollars, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported today, quoting Finance Minister Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
According to Ani, the rate of inflation declined tremendously from
72.8 percent in December 1995 to less than 10 percent by the end of
November this year.
</P>
<P>
With interest rates falling and remaining stable, the minister said
that the distress syndrome in the country's banking system has been
contained and all cases of distressed banks will be finally disposed
of very soon.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the grave situation in which 80 percent of the total
revenue of a state or local government council was devoted to
recurrent expenditure, saying that it was not conducive to the growth.
</P>
<P>
The minister, therefore, urged states and local government councils
to critically review their expenditure pattern and re-order their
priorities so that their activities would have direct impact on the
people.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi, Libyan Pilgrims Allowed to Enter S. Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia said today it
will allow pilgrims from Iraqi and Libya, both under
U.N. sanctions, to enter the Kingdom during the next Haj season.
</P>
<P>
A government statement carried by official Saudi Press Agency
said that Riyadh authorities would take necessary measures so that
pilgrims from Libya and Iraq can perform religious rituals in a
calm atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia would reschedule flights to enable those pilgrims,
in accordance with authorized quotas, to be airlifted by third
part.
</P>
<P>
Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and every Muslim who is
able, and can afford, to perform it should do so at least once in
his or her life time.
</P>
<P>
Haj usually takes place in December of the Islamic calendar
during which several million Muslims from every corner of the
world assemble in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi
Arabia to perform pilgrimage. The next Haj season falls in March.
</P>
<P>
The statement said EgyptAir has been named by the U.N. Security
Council to ship Libyan pilgrims to the Saudi Red Sea coast city of
Jeddah from Tripoli and Benghazi airports.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose a solution of the issue of Iraq, which
under the 1 per 1,000 quota system is allowed to send up to
20,000 pilgrims to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western countries imposed a "no-fly" zone over
southern Iraq in the wake of the Gulf War which evicted Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait. However, Iraq broke the ban last year with a
jetliner carrying 104 pilgrims on board touching down at Jeddah
Airport after permission from the Saudi authorities.

U.S. company Vishay Intertechnology Inc. for about 500 million

<HEADLINE> Jordan Confirms Fifth Execution of Jordanian by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 16 (Xinhua) - The Jordanian government today
confirmed that Iraq authority on December 10 executed a Jordanian
prisoner on charge of murder, which has been the fifth this month.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ali Mohammad Sabbah, an Egyptian national with
Jordanian citizenship, was executed after he had been found guilty
in killing an Iraqi citizen, said Minister of State for
Information Affairs Samir Mutawi at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authority did not inform the Jordanian Embassy in
Iraq or Sabbah's family members before and during the day of his
execution, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's embassy in Baghdad was told about the execution on
December 14, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sabbah was not linked to the four Jordanian students executed
on December 8 on charge of smuggling car spare parts worth about
800 U.S. dollars, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mutawi mentioned that continuous contact were being
made by the government with the Iraqi authority to secure the
release of Jordanian detainees in Iraqi jails as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan's strong reaction to the December 8
execution had not been intended to create a crisis with Iraq
but to express Jordan's condemnation to what had happened.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation of the
execution of the four Jordanians. It also called back its
charge d'affaires to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Hussein repeatedly condemned the execution,
saying that Jordan would not make bargains with Iraq on the rights
of the Jordanians even if it cut off oil supply to the kingdom.
Iraq is the sole oil supplier for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's government, House of Representatives and the Senate
all released statements, condemning the execution as inhumane and
unjust.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has made efforts to prevent Iraq from executing the
four Jordanians, but all of them, including those exerted by King
Hussein, failed.
</P>
<P>
Amid wide accusation from the kingdom, Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan promised to secure the release of 140
Jordanian prisoners jailed in Iraq on Jordan's demand.
</P>
<P>
Later, Iraq declared that it commuted the death sentence on a
Jordanian prisoner named as Ammar Ghaleb Shehabeddine, who was
originally charged of smuggling car spare parts from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There were over 100 Jordanian prisoners serving their
prison terms in the jails across Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
Gulf War. But after that, the bilateral ties suffered a setback
as Jordan was eager to distance itself away from Iraq to end
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein gave asylum to top Iraqi defectors in August 1995
when the bilateral ties hit the lowest level in years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jordan expelled three Iraqi diplomats on charge of
espionage. The current expulsion has been the second in history.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties has been picking up in recent years as Iraq
begins to provide the kingdom with more oil at discount prices and
keeps increasing the volume of imports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq provided Jordan with oil worth 625 million dollars
this year, a 7 percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Electoral Commission Warns Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Electoral Commission
today warned candidates against encouraging pre-polls violence
during their campaign for the December 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Kivuitu, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, told a
press brief here that some presidential and parliamentary
candidates are encouraging violence, adding that "they condemn it
during the day but preach it at night."
</P>
<P>
He called on Kenyan people to report incidents of violence or
intimidation and harassment to the commission which will instruct
the police to investigate and take action.
</P>
<P>
Following talks held between the commission and Kenyan police
today, a senior police officer said that so far two people had
been killed, 63 injured and 50 arrested in campaign violence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Kenyan police warned Kenyans
against carrying dangerous weapons at public meetings during the
electioneering period.
</P>
<P>
Incidents of people carrying dangerous weapons have increased,
it said, adding that "this increase has assumed some worrying
levels at this time of electioneering."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that youths of the ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) fought with the supporters of the
opposition National Development Party in Nymira over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Reports from West Pokot said that youths of the opposition
Ford-Kenya interrupted KANU's civic campaigns and turned the
function into their own.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential, parliamentary and civic nominations,
candidates were required to sign the Electoral Code of Conduct
which is designed to regulate the behavior of all political
parties and candidates.
</P>
<P>
It is mandatory that every political party and candidate
intending to contest the elections must subscribe to the code.
</P>
<P>
Under the code worked out by the Inter-party Parliamentary
Group last month, parties and candidates are required to condemn
violence and intimidation, avoid using or publishing inflammatory
language to ensure that no weapons of any kind are carried to
political meetings.
</P>
<P>
The code provides that infringement of the code can bring
penalties ranging from suspension, disqualification and stopping
of candidates from participating in the elections.

on the Afghan warring parities to abandon military confrontation
and settle their disputes through political dialogues.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Security Council reiterated its grave
concern at the continued military confrontation in Afghanistan,
which had caused human suffering and material destruction and
threatened to lead to the disintegration of the country.
</P>
<P>
Deploring the unwillingness of the Afghan warring factions to
lay down their arms and cooperate with the United Nations for
peace, the Council stressed the continued military confrontation
in the country had posed a great threat to the regional and
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also stressed the Afghan conflict had no
military solution and that the primary responsibility for finding
a peaceful settlement lied with the Afghan parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
It urged all Afghan parities to take genuine
confidence-building measures, to agree immediately on a
cease-fire, and to engage without precondition in a political
dialogue aimed at achieving national reconciliation, a lasting
political settlement of the conflict and the formation of a
broad-based, fully representative government that would protect
the rights of all Afghans.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council deplored the fact that foreign military
support to the Afghan parities continued through 1997 and
reiterated its call to all states to end immediately the supply of
arms, ammunition, military equipment, training or any other
military support to all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan,
including the involvement of foreign military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Council insisted that the United Nations, as a universally
recognized and impartial intermediary, must be given all necessary
support so it can continue to play a pivotal, central role in
coordinating international efforts towards a peaceful solution to
the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Council supported the efforts of the Secretary-General
aimed at the establishment of a solid international framework in
order to address the external aspects of the Afghan question and,
in this context, welcomed the convening of meetings of countries
concerned as well as those of the immediate neighbors and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Supports to Implement Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli cabinet minister
said today that he supports full and honest implementation of the
agreements between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said he
opposes that one people control the fate of another, according to
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
Kahalani made the remarks at a meeting here with PNA chief
negotiator and Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, they exchanged views on bilateral security
cooperation, but made no decisions, the JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani has asked the Palestinian side to cooperate in
cracking down on car theft, which is rampant this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 43,371 cars have been stolen in Israel
since last January, 25 percent more than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the estimate of Israeli police, 60 percent of the
stolen cars have been transferred to PNA self-rule territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel ordered 15,000 Israeli troops last November to work
alongside the police to prevent the stolen cars from being
transferred to PNA territories.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Debates Pullback, Permanent Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet reconvened
late today to further discuss the planned second-stage
redeployment in the West Bank and guidelines on permanent talks
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The crucial meeting was held on the eve of the Thursday
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Paris. The
cabinet was trying to formulate a final map over the planned
redeployment and final-status talks with the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
But the Prime Minister's Office made it clear today that
Israel would not announce a final map on the further pullback and
permanent talks until mid-January.
</P>
<P>
The office added that Netanyahu would update Albright on the
latest Israeli internal consultations when they meet Thursday,
but would not give a specific percentage of the second-phase
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu would also present
Albright a 12-page report on what is called the PNA's
antisemitism and incitement against Israel in violation of signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Netanyahu is gaining understanding from the
U.S. that he needs more time to delay the second-phase
redeployment until mid-January after winning the Knesset
(Parliament) approval of the 1998 budget, which is facing strong
opposition from both the ruling and opposition camps due to
massive budgetary cuts.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has to rely on the right-wing parties' support to
get the budget through the Knesset at the end of the month,
otherwise his government will fall. If he pushes hard now for the
approval of the controversial redeployment, the rightists will
take advantage of the budget vote to pressure Netanyahu to cancel
it.
</P>
<P>
During the first session held Sunday, the cabinet already
reviewed different maps of Israeli interests presented by Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon. The two ministers differed on the width of two
proposed security zones to be created along the Green Line and
the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
Sharon proposed creating a 10-15 kilometer security zone east
of the Green Line to divide Israel and the Palestinian self-rule
areas, and another 20-kilometer zone along the Jordan Valley.
Sharon calls for retaining control over the water sources and all
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai presented two maps, one on Israel's strategic
interests and another on the national interests. He proposed
narrowing the security zones along the Green Line and Jordan
Valley to three-six kilometers and seven to 10 kilometers
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Both Mordechai and Foreign Minister David Levy insisted that
Israel's holding on to less territories would help promote the
chance of advancing the peace process. Both favored earlier
withdrawal in order to win diplomatic points for Israel to get
out the international isolation caused by the stalemate in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA is increasingly losing patience with the
Israeli government, as shown in recent statements made by senior
Palestinian officials who warned against renewed violence and
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
PNA Communication Minister Imad Falouji told a PNA newspaper
Monday that "Israel is going to pay a high price if violence
reignites." PNA Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim warned last
week that "our options are not closed if we feel we've reached a
dead end."
</P>
<P>
But Nabil Sha'ath, PNA Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation, said Monday in Paris the PNA is willing to wait
until mid-January to see whether Israel will make a concrete
decision on further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. supports the PNA in its demand that
Israel must agree to a time-out of its settlement expansion.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Home Resales Down in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
Canada's 25 major markets tumbled 10.4 percent last month, the
largest monthly drop since March, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
In November, a total of 17, 525 dwellings changed hands in the
country, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
</P>
<P>
On a year-over-year basis, November resales were 24 percent
lower than in November, 1996. Areas that were hit hard included
Victoria, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents attribute the slowdown to a lack of new
listings, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Too much should not be read into one month's data," the
association warned, noting that the markets will see a rebound
this month.
</P>
<P>
"Job growth continues to trend high, and a rise in short-term rates
often draws potential buyers into the market before financing costs
rise further," the association said.

of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will yield good results and
strengthen relations in all spheres among the member states.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad told the official
Kuwait News Agency that the GCC foreign ministers' meeting will

He said the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait will submit draft
resolutions and recommendations in their final form to their
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Talks Not on Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Martin Indyk stressed here today the U.S. peace mission is
focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian track while the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks have to be taken up afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. hope that all tracks make progress, but now we
concentrate our efforts on the Palestinian track because some
agreements have been observed," he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. is doubling its efforts to seek all
agreements on this track fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Lebanese and Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been
frozen since December 1995 as Israeli current Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu refused to abide by promises made by late
premier Yitzhak Rabin for a complete withdrawal from the Syrian
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, whose 15 percent area has been occupied by Israeli
troops since 1985, insists that negotiations with Israel must
take place at the same time when Syria starts talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said on the basis of his experience, the Israelis want
to withdraw form south Lebanon and at the same time it asks its
north border security be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said all this should be put into the negotiation
process. But he didn't specify when the negotiation will start
and if the U.S. would to make more efforts toward that.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, who arrived in Lebanon this morning for a day-long
visit, had held talks with the country's leaders, including the
president Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, House Speaker
Nabih Berry, Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz and Defense Minister
Mohsen Dalloul.
</P>
<P>
His talks with them focussed on bilateral relations and the
situation in the region, especially south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Lebanon, the last leg of his regional
tour, he has visited Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Territories
and Syria accompanied by U.S. peace process coordinator Dennis
Ross.

<HEADLINE> NATO Consensus on Continued Presence in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO reached a consensus
today on the need for a military presence to continue beyond June
next year to further consolidate the peace process in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers, who met for their annual North Atlantic
Council meeting, endorsed a politico-military guidance to the NATO
military authorities for the development of options for a NATO-led
military presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina following the end of
SFOR's mandate.
</P>
<P>
NATO military authorities will provide these options to the
NATO council in permanent session no later than mid-January 1998
to allow for the early selection of an option, following
consultations with non-NATO contributors and a careful assessment
of the likely security situation in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The final communique of the meeting said that the military
alliance remains committed to the full and unconditional
implementation of the Dayton peace agreement and to the
establishment of that country as a single, democratic and
multi-ethnic state.
</P>
<P>
NATO foreign ministers also endorsed the conclusions of last
week's Peace Implementation Conference held in Bonn that are
intended to achieve further progress in implementing the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers discussed four options of continued
military presence in Bosnia. The options ranged from total
withdrawal of ground forces to a deterrent force with different
force levels and with different tasking, according to a NATO
official.
</P>
<P>
But no figures were discussed at today's meeting. The same
official, who demanded not to be named, said that the size of the
post-June follow-on ground force will be decided by the NATO
Military Committee.
</P>
<P>
A final decision concerning the follow-on force is expected to
be taken before March 1 next year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has contributed to consolidating the peace progress in
Bosnia by organizing and leading a Stabilization Force (SFOR) with
the participation of all 16 allies and 20 non-NATO countries
including Russia.
</P>
<P>
At its defense minister meeting held in the week before last,
NATO decided to keep SFOR at its current force levels (about
34,000) in Bosnia until next June instead of planned phase-out
withdrawal after local elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued after today's meeting said that following
consultations last week with the non-NATO contributors, NATO
confirmed that SFOR would continue at its present force levels
until otherwise directed.
</P>
<P>
NATO Military Committee Chairman Klaus Naumann and NATO
European Theater Commander-in-Chief Wesley Clark briefed the
foreign ministers about the latest development and general
situation in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed that much more could have been
achieved had the authorities in Bosnia contributed their full
share.
</P>
<P>
"Peace, and the institutions of civil society to uphold it,
remain fragile," the communique said.

<HEADLINE> Efforts on State-Enterprise Reform Paid Off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government this
year has accelerated the pace of state-enterprise reform' and the
firms have initially rebounded in terms of overall economic
returns, according to Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a three-day annual state economic and
trade conference which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a commission report, China's state industrial
enterprises earned a profit of 22.5 billion yuan in the first nine
months of this year, up 66.7 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
State-enterprise losses for the year are estimated at 72
billion yuan, slightly lower than last year. "The downward trend
with increasing losses and lower profits has initially been
halted," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of China's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions made a net profit through September, and another 12
entities reduced their losses compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
For 89 enterprises who registered more than 50 million yuan of
losses each in 1996, their total loss between January and
September was 2.27 billion yuan less than the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the economic recovery could be attributed to reform
measures taken by the Chinese government in recent years,
including establishing a modern-enterprise system, optimizing the
capital structure and following the principle of "focusing on
reform of the large enterprises while allowing flexible operations
for smaller ones."
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, 100 enterprises will increase their efforts
to establish a modern system, which includes a limited liability
system, a legal-person property management system and a
legal-person management mechanism.

strike.
</P>
<P>
The party, which is led by the head of France's neo-liberal
movement and former finance minister Alain Madelin, also condemned
what it called "the scandalous and unacceptable hostage-taking of
passengers in the full heart of winter" by the strikers on the
Line B of the RER Paris suburban train network and some trade
unions supporting the strike.
</P>
<P>
The conductors of the trains on that line have been on strike
since Monday asking for pay hikes.
</P>
<P>
"It makes people fear a blackmail under whatever pretext by
some unions during the season of the 1998 Football World Cup,"
said the party in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Strikes by public transport workers take place frequently in
France.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Major Reform of Textile Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
selected the financially troubled, worker-redundant textile sector
to be the prime target for state-enterprise reform in the next
three years. Successful breakthroughs in reforms in the textile
industry could set an example for other large and medium-size
state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"China has set the target to resolve problems within three
years for state enterprises operating in the red. The textile
industry is the main target in 1998," said Wang Zhongyu, minister
of the State Economic and Trade Commission at a three-day national
economic and trade conference which ended today.
</P>
<P>
Wang told the conference that China has determined to make the
textile industry profitable again, to divert 1.2 million workers
to other job opportunities and to reduce 10 million old spindles
before 2001.
</P>
<P>
Data from the State Statistical Bureau indicates that China now
has 4,031 state textile enterprises with a workforce of more than
4 million, or 10 percent of China's total industrial employees.
</P>
<P>
The sector has registered losses for three consecutive
years. Some 1,031 large and medium-sized textile enterprises
posted losses of 9.63 billion yuan in 1996, accounting for 19.6
percent of the country's total. Both the number of enterprises
running in the red and the loss volume were the biggest among
all industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons behind the losses is an excessive
number of spindles. To reduce the number of spindles and encourage
cost-efficient production, textile mills have been offered
incentives.

<TEXT>
<P>
The enterprises can obtain 5 million yuan: 3 million yuan in
government allocations and 2 million yuan in loans with interests
subsidized by the State for eliminating 10,000 spindles. "All the
capital should be used to develop new products, adjust the product
mix and arrange help for laid-off employees," said a textile
official.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to issue licenses for
manufacturers and sellers of textile machinery to reduce the
number of spindles.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has 47 million spindles, 12 million of which
are obsolete. This outdated equipment is one more reason for
inefficiencies, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the eliminated spindles from being installed in other
locations, such as smaller rural mills, the 10 million spindles
removed from service between 1998 and 2000 will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuliang, director of the management department under the
China National Textile Council, told Xinhua that the financially
troubled textile sector is considered one of China's biggest
headaches in enterprise reform. The government this year allocated
9.73 billion yuan for 555 state textile enterprises to write off
non-performing and bad accounts.
</P>
<P>
"The state plans to project an additional 10 billion yuan in the
regard, of which a larger portion will be used to rejuvenate the
textile sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the central government has lowered cotton
prices this year. The reduced raw-materials cost has effectively
cut losses for the industry. The losses between January and
September this year were 21.3 percent, or 1.78 billion yuan less
than the same period of previous year.
</P>
<P>
Ma said 4.8 million spindles will be reduced in the coastal
provinces and municipalities in 1998, and 600,000 employees be
assigned new jobs. "With the state preferential policy in place
and other effective reform efforts, the sector is set to cut 3
billion yuan of losses next year," Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Urged to Set Up Collective Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU) has urged the establishment of collective
contract system between management and labor.
</P>
<P>
The system should cover 70 percent of the country's state-owned
enterprises and 40 percent of its foreign-funded enterprises in
1998, the federation says.
</P>
<P>
Under the collective contract system, collective bargaining
agreements are signed between trade unions, on behalf of
enterprise employees, and enterprise managers. The aim is to
safeguard the legal rights of both sides and stabilize the labor
relationship, ACFTU officials said. The practice is widespread in
market economies.
</P>
<P>
The contracts involve salary, hours, working conditions,
insurance, welfare, labor disputes and employee duties.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the ACFTU show that more than 187,000
enterprises have already signed collective contracts, covering
more than 54 million people.
</P>
<P>
Included are 141,000 state-owned and collective businesses,
18,000 foreign-funded enterprises, and more than 6,000 private
enterprises, according to the statistics.

<HEADLINE> Kim Dae-jung Makes Last-ditch Effort for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- With less than 24 hours left before
the South Korea's presidential election, Kim Dae-jung, presidential
candidate of the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), today made
his last-ditch effort for support on the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
"I am standing making my last presidential bid. I want to
devote my 40 years of preparation and experience to successfully
managing the state, bringing hope to the people," Kim read an
emotional message at a press conference. He is making his fourth
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
The veteran opposition leader, 72, quit politics after losing
the 1992 presidential poll. But he resumed his political career by
establishing his No.1 opposition NCNP in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he was completely positive that he will win the
election barring any last-minute campaign irregularities by the
Grand National Party's Lee Hoi-chang. The campaign will end at
Wednesday's midnight.
</P>
<P>
If he fails, Kim said, he will humbly accept the election
result and cooperate with the new President in leading the nation
in the right way.
</P>
<P>
"By voting for a change of power from the ruling party to the
opposition, you voters should show that Korea is a democracy," Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
If elected, Kim said, he will have those people who caused the
current economic crisis take political and administrative
responsibility for their misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that he will faithfully honor the agreement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on its bailout loan terms.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, he will meet with Michel Camdessus, the IMF
head, to have additional talks aimed at preventing massive layoffs
and bankruptcies of corporates.
</P>
<P>
The opposition candidate also said he will grant a special
amnesty to the imprisoned former Presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo, to achieve reconciliation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou
Jiahua has urged the country to step up strategic adjustments to
the economy to maintain sustainable, rapid, sound development.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier's remarks came at the National Conference on
Planning which was held here Dec. 13-16.
</P>
<P>
He said China has maintained a sustained and rapid economic
development in recent years while holding the line on prices.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has had several good years in a row, and the
bottleneck in the sectors of energy and communications has been
eased. Domestic savings also have remained at a relatively high
level. All these factors have contributed to sustained and rapid
economic development, the vice-premier added.
</P>
<P>
He urged various localities to take a moderate path in
investment growth, optimize investment structure, expand exports
and vigorously tap international markets.
</P>
<P>
Zou said priority should be given to re-employment,
establishment and perfection of the social security system,
deepening reform in grain and cotton circulation systems, and the
industrialization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The coastal and advanced areas should support economic
development in the vast central and western parts of the country,
he said, to narrow economic disparity.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said today his government opposed a parliamentary
proposal that elections be postponed beyond the May schedule.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's National Assembly (parliament) is considering
postponing the polls by at least two months to allow better
preparation for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said his government insisted that the general elections
be held on May 23 as scheduled. If it was to be put off for
technical problems, it should be no more than one month.
</P>
<P>
But he said it was up to the parliament to make the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
Co-Interior Minister Sar Kheng, who is overseeing the election,
told members of parliament on Tuesday that the planned date was no
longer feasible as preparations, including voter registration, had
not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
He said at least 11 months was needed to have everything
prepared and the electoral committee itself would require 17 weeks
for training.
</P>
<P>
He suggested two alternative dates -- July 31 and October 18 --
for the election. Parliamentarians were expected to vote on the
dates today, officials said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, ADB to Deliver Loans to Seoul Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is likely to
deliver the first part of its promised 10 billion U.S. dollars of
loan to South Korea next Tuesday at the earliest, about a week
ahead of the original schedule, sources of the Ministry of
Finance and Economy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the bank's first installment has not been finally
decided, but may be set between 2.5 billion to 3 billion
U.S. dollars, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, ending two weeks of working-level negotiations
over the loan conditions with South Korean officials here, plans
to announce the results Thursday, they said.
</P>
<P>
As part of its loan conditions, the bank has reportedly asked
the Korean government to upgrade transparency of corporate
governance, reinforce fair competition policies and improve the
managerial soundness of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to
extend an additional 3.53 billion U.S. dollars to Seoul Wednesday
in the second batch of its 21- billion- U.S-dollar rescue package.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Development Bank, which signed an accord of a
4-billion-U.S-dollar loan with the country last week, will also
send 2 billion U.S. dollars as its first installment next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Successive infusion of dollars this and next week is expected
to greatly contribute to normalizing the nation's foreign exchange
flows," said a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will continue to persuade Washington
and Tokyo to extend loans to Seoul as soon as possible, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Tells Police to Get Results in Fighting Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Wednesday
challenged the Philippine National Police (PNP) to "get results"
in their anti-crime drive, telling PNP officers and men to leave
the service if they can not do their job as expected.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a ceremony held for outgoing PNP Director
General Recaredo Sarmiento and his successor, Santiago Alino,
Ramos asked for a new creative effort on the part of every police
officer, regardless of rank and station, "to focus on the crime
categories that have shown a pattern of increase."
</P>
<P>
The president identified these crimes as kidnap-for-ransom,
drug trafficking, car jacking and rape.
</P>
<P>
"I tell you now to bring results, results, results," Ramos
said, adding every police officer must now stretch his imagination
and reach into his wits.
</P>
<P>
"Are you willing and capable enough to investigate a crime when
it is reported, hunt the offender, coordinate with all the pillars
of the criminal justice system and help convict the accused beyond
reasonable doubt?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"If these questions do not bother you at all, it is time to
abandon policing your way of life and leave the service. The
community expects no less," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president appealed to legislators to pass into
law a five-year PNP modernization program so that the PNP can
respond to the needs of the times.
</P>
<P>
Sarmiento resigned for the PNP's failure to stop the high
incidence of kidnap-for-ransom cases in the country. Alino took
the oath to replace him during today's ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams US Policy, War Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi official spokesman said
today that U.S. President Bill Clinton is again fooling himself
about the world's position vis-a-vis U.S. military threats to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Clinton's statement at a news conference
Tuesday, the spokesman said Clinton has for the first time
admitted that there are parties willing to see the seven-year-old
U.N. sanctions on Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reportedly said the number of states sympathizing with
U.S. firm position towards Iraq has increased recently more than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that Clinton and his administration
have realized the isolation the United States had been driven
into as a result of its anti-Iraq policy.
</P>
<P>
The world public opinion has adopted a stand opposing
U.S. threats, having perceived the facts in relation to Iraq's
legitimate demands in defense of its sovereignty, security and
interests of its people, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said three permanent U.N. Security Council members, all
European nations except Britain, and the entire Arab countries
have objected to the logic of aggression and sabre rattling
pursued by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq threatened on October 29 to expel U.S. weapon inspectors
with U.N. Special Commission on charge of espionage and put the
threat into reality a week later. This led to a crisis in which
Washington threatened war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian mediation, Iraq agreed on November 21 to allow
U.N. inspectors to return to Baghdad to resume their work.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
can only be lifted when the weapon inspectors verify that the
country is free from powerful weapons.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Good Start for Hong Kong's New Era (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Almost everyone here agrees
that everything in Hong Kong has gone well since July 1, when it
finally threw off the 156-year-old British rule and came back to
the embrace of China.
</P>
<P>
As the year 1997 is going out, the gloomy prediction that "Hong
Kong is over" has not come true. On the contrary, the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has shown the whole world its
vitality in its new era of development.
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa paid his first
duty visit to Beijing, where he made "a full report" to President
Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng on what had happened in Hong Kong
after the handover.
</P>
<P>
The two Chinese leaders and vice-premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian
Qichen recognized that the SAR government has done a good job in
dealing with internal socio-political and economic affairs,
keeping in line with the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Similar views are shared by a number of national and world
leaders, who traveled to Hong Kong in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Both President of the World Bank (WB) James Wolfensohn and
Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel
Camdessus said at the WB/IMF annual meetings here in September
that Hong Kong enjoyed high-degree autonomy and maintained its
prosperity, stability and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Choosing Hong Kong as the venue of the meetings was a vote of
cheer and confidence of the world for the SAR, they said.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Good Start for Hong Kong's New Era (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, said at the
end of his five-day Hong Kong trip in September that he "looked
forward to the success" of the SAR under the "One Country, Two
Systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
A few important facts might be worth mentioning about the
success story of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
First, the rule of law has remained unchanged in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the power of final adjudication vested in the SAR's Court
of Final Appeal, which is now functioning fully and independently,
Hong Kong has gained a fully integrated system of courts for the
first time in its history.
</P>
<P>
A ruling of the Appeal Court on July 30 upheld the legitimacy
of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) and put the validity
of all laws it passed after June 30 beyond any doubt. The PLC has
adopted a great number of bills up to now, providing legal grounds
for the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Another important event in Hong Kong's legal affairs was the
election early this month of 36 Hong Kong's representatives to the
9th National People's Congress (NPC), the nation's supreme organ
of power. This was the first time for Hong Kong to elect deputies
to the NPC as an independent constituency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, voter registration for the first Legislative Council
elections scheduled for next May is going on in full swing.

<TEXT>
<P>
Secondly, the SAR government has been functioning smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Chief Executive Tung has done a lot of
work in creating a good business environment, extending the mass
transit system and expanding infrastructure development, improving
education and promoting the well-being of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
For example, the government has speeded up housing supply, with
the objective of building 85,000 flats a year and achieving a home
ownership rate of 70 percent in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Tung visited a number of Asian and European countries to brief
foreign leaders and businessmen on the good situation in Hong
Kong, the southern gateway to China and an international
financial, trade and shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's 180,000-strong civil service remains "dedicated,
honest and efficient" within the framework of a small government
with less public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the economy has maintained its vitality in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product is estimated to have grown by around
5 percent in the July-September period year-on-year, and to
increase by 5.5 percent this year as a whole against 1996, despite
the effects of the financial turmoil which has swept some Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Though the performance of tourism, Hong Kong's top hard
currency earner, has been weak mainly due to the effect of the
financial turmoil and relatively high prices here, the overall
external trade has maintained its trend of growth in general.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the IMF said in its recent assessment, the SAR, with high
foreign exchange reserves, fiscal reserves, a strong banking
system and solid economic fundamentals, not only succeeded in
beating back speculators and defending the l4-year-old linking
system between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar in the
financial turbulence which affected almost all the main stock
markets in the world, but also withstood the effects of the global
financial market volatility.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the way of Hong Kong people's life has remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In any teahouse here, the noise-level equals any New York bar,
Tokyo pub or Moscow cafe.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday evenings and Saturdays, tens of thousands of local
residents swarm to the Happy Valley and Sha Tin Racecourse to bet
on horse races.
</P>
<P>
The local media enjoy freedom of expression and say what they
want to as before, and protests are not forbidden even in front of
the building of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The results of the latest survey by the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong reflected a positive outlook for
Hong Kong's business environment against the backdrop of the
recent economic slowdown in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
More than 96 percent of the survey respondents had a "very
favorable" or "favorable" view about Hong Kong's business
environment over the next five years, while over 55 percent of
AmCham member companies intended to expand their business and 89
percent said they will retain Hong Kong as their regional
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The high level of confidence is related to Hong Kong's smooth
transition and political stability, sound economic fundamentals
and the overall rapid development in China.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address issued in early October, Tung Chee Hwa
outlined the priorities of the SAR government in the coming years
including moving forward in the high value-added direction in both
 services and industrial sectors. He also voiced determination to
strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness and ensure its future
prosperity.

CHENGDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Wu Bangguo, a Member of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Politburo and
Vice-Premier, today called on all Chinese to be confident and
hard-working to achieve state-enterprise reform goals set by the
Party.
</P>
<P>
Most large and medium-size state firms will be able to solve
their financial woes through reform, re-organization,
transformation and strengthening management by the end of this
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu's remarks came at a national economic and trade conference,

</P>
<P>
In his speech, the vice premier said the 15th CPC National
Congress had made new breakthroughs theoretically in
state-enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have pinned
high hopes on 1998, the first year of three for realizing
the strategic goals of enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
The issue of re-employment for those laid off from state-run
factories should be given great significance, he said. Measures
will be taken to curb illegal charges and levies on enterprises
next year, he added.

ADDIS ABABA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- About 27,000 people
residing in eastern Ethiopia will get access to telephone service
this year when the installation and expansion works on telephone
lines are completed, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ahmed Hussien, acting general manager of the
Dire Dawa region telephone office, as saying that the
installation and expansion of telephone lines are now in progress
in Dira Dawa, Harar, Jijiga, Asebe-Teferre and Gode Towns.
</P>

Ahmed said residents of the stated towns will be able to
receive both local and long-distance calls easily when the
expansion of automatic digitals and the installation of radio
receivers are completed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the installation of radio receiver meant
the establishment of telephone communication between Milso,
Asebeteferre, Gursum and Harar towns is underway.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Ask for Rescheduling of Debt Repayment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
not ask for rescheduling of the repayment of the country's foreign
debts, a senior official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We've never thought of rescheduling the repayment of our
foreign debts. Indonesia is striving to meet its debt commitment,"
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said after meeting with
President Soeharto at his Jalan Cendana residence here.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono made the statement when replying to questions on the
possible rescheduling of foreign debt repayment due to the fall of
the rupiah (national currency).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's foreign debts stood at 117.3 billion dollars as of
September this year. Of the figure, the government's debt was 52.3
billion dollars and the private sector's debt was 65 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At least 9.6 billion dollars of the total private debt would
mature by March 1998, Bank Indonesia, the central bank, said
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some economists here said the huge private debt was one of the
most important causes for the devaluation of the rupiah as many
people rushed for dollars at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has dropped by more than 100 percent
against the US dollar since the beginning of this year.

LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- British Gulf War veterans are
to gather at the Defense Ministry on January 17 in a co-ordinated
protest marking the seventh anniversary of the start of the air
war in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"Some families of Gulf War veterans who have already died will
lay wreaths on the steps of the ministry and the Gulf veterans
will lay their medals around them and walk away," campaign
co-ordinator Tony Flint told the Independent newspaper on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The mass protest is believed to be unprecedented in the history
of the armed forces and will underline the sense of abandonment
felt by many of those who have become ill since serving in the war.
</P>
<P>
Veterans, campaigning for official recognition of "Gulf War
Syndrome", believe the illnesses result from a cocktail of
chemicals given to the troops.
</P>
<P>
They say 140 have died in Britain since returning from the Gulf
and up to 6,000 are sick.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms include asthma, chronic fatigue, depression and
skin ailments.
</P>
<P>
About 51,000 British troops served in the Gulf war.

Meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC) National Committee, said that despite some setbacks,
Sino-Australian relationship in general has been developing
relatively smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a six-day goodwill visit to Australia on the
occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic ties between the two countries, stressed that since
1990 the bilateral ties have been progressing in a relatively
healthy, rapid and all-round way.
</P>
<P>
He noted that high-level exchanges between the two sides have
been increasing, their economic and trade relations have been
enhanced and their exchanges and cooperation in such fields as
culture, education, science and technology have been expanding.
</P>
<P>
On some major international and regional issues, the two
countries have held consultations and cooperated with each other,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"China is satisfied with the development of the bilateral
ties," Li said, adding that China always attaches importance to
its relations with Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Although they are different in social system, China and
Australia bear no historical grudges against each other and no
conflict of fundamental interests exists between them," he said.
"Rather, as both countries are located in the Pacific rim and
their economies are supplementary to each other, there exists vast
potential for cooperation between them."
</P>
<P>
"The rapidly growing economic and trade relations have long
played a positive role in promoting the development of the
bilateral ties in various fields," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He told the prime minister that China appreciates the
Australian government's "one China policy," under which Taiwan is
part of China.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman said that at its 15th National Congress held
earlier this year, the Chinese Communist Party pledged to
unswervingly promote the policy of reform and opening up to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Li also conveyed the sincere regards of Chinese Premier Li Peng
to Prime Minister Howard.
</P>
<P>
Howard extended his warm welcome to the CPPCC chairman, saying
Li's visit indicates the importance China attaches to its ties
with Australia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that the bilateral ties are built
firmly on the basis of mutual benefit and the Australian
government is satisfied with the development of the relations.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging that people-to-people exchanges and exchanges
at the state or provincial level have been increasing rapidly, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that such exchanges would continue.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Tour Seeks New African Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin began a tour of three African countries Wednesday in a bid
to reform the traditional model of Franco-African relations and
seek a new partnership with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, accompanied by several government ministers and a
delegation of French businessmen, will visit Morocco, which is a
major economic partner of France in Africa, before going to
Senegal and Mali.
</P>
<P>
Immigration and drug trafficking will be two major issues to be
raised in Jospin's meeting with King Hassan II and Prime Minister
Albellatif Filali of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Morocco is expected to ask France to provide aid to the Nord
region of the country, where 30,000 tons of cannabis and hashish
were produced each year, and three-quarters of the drug were
smuggled and sold in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Nord region is also the home area of one-third of the
720,000 Moroccan immigrants living in France, who left home
because of poverty and under-development.
</P>
<P>
In Senegal, Jospin will raise the issue of reforming the French
military deployment in Africa and discuss with Senegalese leaders
the training of a pan-African peace-keeping force by France and
other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
France also plans to hold joint military exercises with
Senegal, Mauritania and Mali in February next year as part of the
program to train a future African peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
In Mali, Jospin will discuss the reform of France's cooperation
practise with black-African countries. It will be characterized by
the establishment of a common aid program by European Union
countries instead of France alone for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mali has complained about the disparity in aid by France to
different African countries.
</P>
<P>
France sends an average of 632 francs (105 U.S. dollars) each
year to each inhabitant of Gabon, a big oil producing country for
the French oil group Elf, while only donating 48 francs (8
U.S. dollars) to each inhabitant of Mali.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Low, Growth Steady in Guangdong in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, an
economic powerhouse, is expected to achieve a GDP growth of 10.6
percent while holding inflation at 0.3 percent this year,
provincial Governor Lu Ruihua said today.
</P>
<P>
"The effective control of inflation is a key to ensuring social
stability," the governor told a meeting of the standing committee
of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
The governor attributed the province's low inflation rate to
bumper grain harvests for four consecutive years. Construction
controls were another important factor, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province in recent years has successfully controlled
investment at 240 billion yuan (28.915 billion U.S. dollars) per
ye, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the steady growth, the governor gave credit to
high-tech developments and industrial reorganization.
</P>
<P>
The province has also been successful in expanding markets,
selling one-third of its products to other parts of the country
and another one-third overseas.
</P>
<P>
The governor believes that if the province's economic growth
rate remains at around 10 percent in the coming 13 years, it will
be able to hit its goal of realizing modernization by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Since we've achieved an average annual growth of as high as
16.7 percent for the past seven consecutive years, we'd better let
the economy advance steadily, to avoid big ups and downs," the
governor stressed.

<HEADLINE> Macao Countdown Forum Calls for Active Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents should make
earnest efforts to create a better future in the coming two years
before the handover of power, said participants in a forum.
</P>
<P>
Many participants in a forum Tuesday night on the two year
countdown of Macao's return to the motherland said that Macao
residents should make it their own duty to build a better Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out and there remains a lot to do for a smooth
handover of power in the coming two years," said Tang Chou Kei,
editor-in-chief of the Va Kio newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Business people, he said, should expand their business in Macao
rather than anywhere else. They should make it their duty to turn
Macao into a better place after the establishment of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in December 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang's ideas were widely echoed at the forum, which was
attended by more than 50 people representing different social
groups. The forum was organized by the Macao Basic Law Promotion
Association.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some participants proposed that the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao SAR be established as soon as possible to
encourage Macao residents' participation in social and
transitional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Most participants are optimistic about Macao's future.
</P>
<P>
"Facts show that Hong Kong remains stable and its economy
prospers after its return to China," said Li Po Tin, chairman of
the Macao Coca Cola Company. "Today's Hong Kong will be tomorrow's
Macao. I am convinced that Macao will return smoothly."

<P>
FREETOWN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting and intensive
military manoeuvres are going on today in south eastern Sierra
Leone as government troops fought a pitched battle with Kamajor
militiamen on four fronts, military sources in Freetown told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Our men are engaged in Makpele, Fairoh, Wonday and Zimmi, all
small-sized towns along the Sierra Leone-Liberia border," said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
He said casualty figures are high on both sides since the
fighting erupted on Monday. He said ECOMOG troops stationed in
Liberia have moved about four tanks to the border to prevent the
fighting from spilling into the Liberian territory.
</P>
<P>
Sam Dumbuya, a Kamajor leader attending disarmament talks with
the junta delegates in Freetown, accused government forces of
"provoking the Kamajor into fighting as they constantly attack
the positions they now hold in the south east."
</P>
<P>
"Government troops are using helicopter gunship to pound our
areas and setting fire to houses and rice farms in the area. We
resorted to action as we cannot sit by and let the atrocities
continue," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Major John Milton, director of defense information, rejected
the charges saying "This is nonsense."
</P>
<P>
"How can we do that when we keep asking the Kamajor to drop
their weapons and join us in finding a workable solution to the
political problem now facing us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travellers arriving in the capital have been
speaking of deaths due to starvation which has gripped parts of
the south, with women and children feeding on garri, salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
A medical officer who came to the capital to sensitize medical
officials of the plight said, "people are dying at about 10 a
week because there is no food."
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Boise Williams, there are no medicines and
people are now using local herbs to cure themselves.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Kis Kamara, former Minister of Health who has now been
transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a result of
Monday's cabinet reshuffle, said in an interview that "much
needed drugs are running out because of the sanctions and
embargo."
</P>
<P>
"This means that more people are at the risk of dying if the
situation continues as the hospitals are all seriously affected,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A nurse at the central hospital in the capital said, "many
patients would have to die at an alarming rate if the situation
continues as it is."

JINAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Judicial groups must play a
bigger role in carrying out the law, offering legal services and
publicizing the law in the process of building a socialist
country, Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said today.
</P>

Reviewing the last five years' work, the minister said 20 model
prisons and 15 model re-education-through-labor centers had been
awarded by the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
"No more than 8 percent of those released from the prisons and
centers committed crimes again. In this sense, China is one of the
countries in the world with a low repeat crime rate," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to improving the work in prisons and re-education
centers, China's judicial groups also have made great efforts to
develop legal aid services.

<HEADLINE> Winnie Declines Nomination For ANC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela today declined to accept nomination for the
deputy presidency of the African National Congress (ANC), leaving
the post to Jacob Zuma, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela was nominated today from the floor at the
50th national conference of the ANC in Mafikeng after failing to
secure nomination by any of the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Madikizela-Mandela, ex-wife of South African President Nelson
Mandela, is now president of the ANC Women's League and a member
of the policy-making National Executive Committee (NEC).
</P>
<P>
Her decision to refuse nomination is in line with a request
from the NEC that she should not make herself available.
</P>
<P>
However, some of Madikizela-Mandela's detractors said they
believed she did so to avoid possible humiliation should she be
defeated in the contest against Zuma.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's victory effectively confirms him as successor to Thabo
Mbeki in the deputy presidency of South Africa when Mandela steps
down from the presidency after the 1999 elections.
</P>
<P>
Zuma is currently national chairman of the ANC.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in China

of new investment, statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation show.

<P>
AMMAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today received four
F-16 jet fighters as part of the 300 million U.S. dollars
aid pledged by the United States government.
</P>
<P>
Amid rain and thin fog, the F-16's landed in Azraq, about 80
kilometers southeast of Amman, where King Hussein and some top
military officials attended the ceremony to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
This is the first batch of altogether 16 F-16 fighters that are
expected to be delivered to Jordan by the United States. The
other 12 jet fighters will arrive in Jordan in the next two
months, Jordan's official news agency, Petra, reported.
</P>
<P>
Also arriving this morning was the first group of Jordanian
pilots and technicians who were sent to the United States for
training.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Jordan received 100 million dollars worth of
military equipment from the United States as the first part of the
300 million dollars aid. The remaining 200 million dollars of the
aid are spent on the 16 F-16 jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government endorsed the aid program to Jordan in
1994 following the signing of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jordan was granted non-NATO alliance status, giving
it more access to U.S. military equipment.

<HEADLINE> Tung Calls on HK People to Promote Understanding of Chinese Culture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong people need to
promote their knowledge of the history and culture of China after
Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of an international conference
on heritage and education at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Tung said that the better understanding of the
national culture can enhance the Hong Kong people's awareness of
patriotism and their pride to be a Chinese person.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, to mark the successful conclusion of
the "Year of Heritage", provides a forum for international
heritage and education experts to share their experience in the
field.
</P>
<P>
During the "Year of Heritage", a series of activities including
exhibitions, lectures, visit to historical spots and international
conference were jointly organized by the Antiquities Advisory
Board, the Lord Wilson Heritage Trust and the Antiquities
Monuments Office of the Broadcasting, Culture and Sport Bureau of
the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the activities have helped arouse the interest
of the Hong Kong people, especially the young people, in the
history and culture of China.
</P>
<P>
Due to historical reasons, Hong Kong has been separated from
the motherland for a long time and the people in Hong Kong and the
people on the mainland live under different social systems and
cultural environments, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong people should know the root of the culture of
Hong Kong and strengthen our feeling of integration to Hong Kong
and the motherland," Tung said.

<P>
Some people think Hong Kong only has a history of 156 years,
and they think Hong Kong becomes an international city from a
small fishing island over a period of one hundred years, Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the history of Hong Kong can be dated back to 6,000
years ago. The large number of historical relics excavated in Hong
Kong are witnesses of the history of Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the relics demonstrated that the civilization of
Hong Kong can be traced to the same origin of the great Chinese
civilization, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"When I visited the exhibition of Chinese cultural relics,
which is being held in Hong Kong, I was deeply moved by the
brilliant civilization of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's conference will enable us to learn the latest
development of the heritage and education of the world and promote
the work of heritage protection of Hong Kong," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The conference aims at examining the different roles played by
various parties in heritage education. They include the
government, international organizations, schools, museums,
heritage institutions, learned societies, media, publishers and
commercial concerns.
</P>
<P>
It will also address the educational aspect of heritage
conservation through case studies and provide a forum for
international heritage workers to share their valuable experience
in the field.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is conducted in the form of plenary and
concurrent sessions with papers presented by about 50 speakers
from China's mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, India, Malaysia,
Singapore, Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, Mexico,
Bermuda, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Exhibitions on local heritage and the work and achievements of
local and overseas institutions on heritage education are also
staged at the venue of the conference.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise Sharply in Tokyo on Tax Cut News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices closed sharply
higher Wednesday on the news that the government will cut 2 trillion yen
(about 15.7 billion dollars) in income tax and residential tax to
stimulate the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 555.85 points, or 3.48 percent from
Tuesday's close to 16,541.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, rose 28.53 points, or 2.38 percent to
1,227.95.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 600 million
shares, up from Tuesday's 419.35 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Failed Yamaichi Securities was Wednesday's most actively traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index, which remained weak in early trading, responded
quickly to the tax cut news.
</P>
<P>
When the news was reported at midmorning and confirmed by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at a press conference, the benchmark index
briefly soared more than 800 points.
</P>
<P>
The tax cut decision by Hashimoto, combined with a rumor that the
Bank of Japan intervened to sell dollars, stimulated the currency
market. The U.S. dollar had plunged more than 5 yen at one point to
the 125 yen level in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Portuguese Friendly Cooperation Promotes Macao Stable Transition (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) discussed a wide
range of issues concerning Macao's transition this year. New
progress was scored in many fields.
</P>
<P>
The JLG approved the air agreements Macao signed with India,
the Philippines, Nepal and Myanmar respectively, and agreed to the
renewal of Macao's member status to a number of international
bodies. The JLG also completed discussions of the establishment of
a Portuguese consulate in Macao and China's Foreign Ministry Macao
Office.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the JLG concluded negotiations on the contract on
casinos and successfully resolved the "Oriental Foundation Issue"
after prolonged talks. It also explored new issues like the
handover ceremony in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Officials of both sides agreed that new progress had been made
in the three leading issues of transition -- the localization of
the civil service, the localization of law and the use of Chinese
as an official language.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, about 86 percent of the lower ranking
positions of the civil service had been localized, and a first
Chinese director of a government department assumed office last
month. The Portuguese side promised earlier to have all middle and
senior ranking posts basically localized by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
While local residents took office as judges and procurators,
the Criminal Law and the Code of Criminal Procedure were localized
and took effect. Localization of other leading laws is also being
conducted with great efforts.
</P>
<P>
And the use of Chinese as an official language has been spread
further. More than 90 percent of the government documents are now
printed in both Portuguese and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese officials said that the workload in the three
leading issues and other related issues is still very heavy.
Greater efforts are needed to ensure a smooth handover and stable
transition.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries have reiterated that it is in the
utmost common interests of both peoples to strengthen the friendly
relations between China and Portugal. They have vowed to make more
efforts to bring the relations of cooperation in a broad sphere
into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Portuguese Friendly Cooperation Promotes Macao Stable Transition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Macao has seen another year of
stable transition in 1997 as China and Portugal maintain friendly
relations of cooperation on the question of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both China and Portugal exchanged visits regularly
in 1997, and bilateral relations have been further expanded in the
political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological
fields.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited
Portugal in January, stressing that the Chinese Government pays
great attention to the development of a stable long-term friendly
relations of cooperation with Portugal. Later, China's State
Councilor Song Jian and Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), also visited Portugal.
</P>
<P>
In return, Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio became the first
foreign head of state to visit China after Deng Xiaoping passed
away in February. While meeting with Sampaio, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin pointed out that the Portuguese president's visit
injected new vigor to the development of bilateral relations and
cooperation on the question of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Macao are of the view that the constant contacts
and exchanges of view between leaders of the two countries help
increase mutual understanding and trust, thus contributing to
further growth of the ties between the two countries, and
especially, in the settlement of the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Portugal held that it conforms to the common
interests of the two sides to strive for a smooth handover of
power and to keep Macao stable and growing economically. Good
cooperation in Macao helps promote good relations, they said.

MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said on Wednesday that House of Representatives Speaker Jose
de Venecia still has a better chance of winning next year's
presidential elections than other presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
"(De Venecia is still) better than the others," Ramos said
during a press conference held in the Presidential Palace when
asked about his assessment on de Venecia's chances of winning
after former defense secretary Renato de Villa bolted the ruling
party and formed "a third force" with Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos reiterated his advice for de Villa to
reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Renato de Villa and his followers will reexamine
their position in the light of their participation in and
commitments to the party's political processes and as well as the
chances of their success outside the administration party," Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the former defense secretary will be welcomed by
the Lakas-NUCD party if ever he decides to rejoin "because
reconciliation has always been a major policy thrust of the Ramos
administration."
</P>
<P>
Ramos disclosed that one factor he anointed de Venecia as the
ruling party's standard bearer in next year's presidential polls
was the speaker's capability of continuing the economic, social
and political reforms of the Ramos administration.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Security Exchange
(USE) has set the limit of 150 million Uganda Shillings (some
150,000 U.S. dollars) for a company which intends to be listed on
the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
With trade at the exchange kicking off early in January, the
USE requires small companies to solicit at least 150 million
Uganda Shillings, USE chairman Onegi Obel disclosed to The
Monitor newspaper.
</P>
<P>
With the licensing of 12 brokerages and dealing firms, and two
investment advisers now in place, private companies opting to
solicit capital can contract merchant banks, he added.
</P>
<P>
A company which intends to go public must produce prospectus
to Capital Markets Authority (CMA) for a scrutiny, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to CMA, a company shall be expected to raise a given
amount at primary solicitation before it is allowed to go to the
market for the secondary amount.
</P>
<P>
For a commercial bank, it is the time to adjust and give
related services or be out of the market, said an official from
Nile Bank, the leading underwriter for east Africa development
bank loans for bonds worth 10 billion Uganda Shillings (some 10
million U.S. dollars), which excited many firms here opting to be
listed on stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Demand and supply shall govern trade, and borrowers shall be
doing that at about nil rate or according to the market, which is
a good enough deal," The Monitor quoted a CMA source as saying.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged to Take Initiative in Iran-US Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An influential Iranian daily
today called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to make the first move
to show sincerity about dialogs between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
If Clinton must have a dialog with Iran, he should take the
initiative to indicate Washington's sincerity and seriousness,
said the pro-government newspaper Kayhan International in an
editorial.
</P>
<P>
To mean what he has said, Clinton should accept all of Tehran's
repeated demands, including release of Iranian assets frozen in
the United States, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton Monday expressed his welcome to the remarks made by
his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Khatami Sunday on Iran's
willingness to hold dialogs with the American people.
</P>
<P>
"I would like nothing better than to have a dialog with Iran as
long as we can have an honest discussion of all the relevant
issues," Clinton told the press.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian daily said that only time will prove how far
Clinton will go for his enthusiasm to have a dialog with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the daily expressed doubts about Washington's
sincerity since Clinton reiterates his "anti-Iran rhetoric" that
Tehran is sponsoring terrorism, seeking to sabotage the Middle
East peace process and developing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The widely circulated paper said that Khatami's statement is
nothing new, but a repeat of Iran's policies adopted since the
Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly asserted that it does not entertain any
negative sentiments toward the people of any country, including
the people of the United States, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The "only country at present," which is not recognized by Iran,
is Israel "because it has been established in Palestine by
usurping the natural and bona fide rights of the people of
Palestine," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Any country, other than Israel, which respects mutual rights
and acts within the international conventions, can have normal
relations with Iran, it continued.
</P>
<P>
The United States severed its diplomatic relations with Iran in
1980 after Iranian students took over the American embassy in
Tehran and held the embassy staff in hostage.
</P>
<P>
It imposed an economic sanction on Iran in 1995 and has been
pressuring its allies to isolate the oil-rich Gulf country.

MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos confirmed
Wednesday that the Philippines and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will start negotiations in January for a standby fund
facility, which will serve as a buffer after the country exits
from IMF supervision.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will commence in "the first week of January,"
the president said at a weekly press conference held in the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the standby fund is not a "bailout"
package inasmuch as the Philippines continues to show strong
economic fundamentals despite the current financial storm sweeping
much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a bailout because we are not among those considered
to be bailed out," he said. "We are helping ourselves and we are
taking not only long-range steps but also short-term measures."
</P>
<P>
The standby facility is a sort of credit line or available
funds, plus the presence of an IMF team in Manila to monitor the
country's economic and financial performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that the standby facility is "different
from the regular program" which the country has been undertaking
because the country can refuse the facility if it is not needed.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos said the presence of an IMF team is also "not a
problem" even after his country graduates from the IMF at the end
of the year as has been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Water Quality of Huaihe River Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Water quality of the Huaihe
River, one of China's longest, is showing signs of improvement,
thanks to a massive pollution control campaign to clean up the river
water.
</P>
<P>
Latest sample checks indicate the organisms in industrial waste
water discharged into the river have reduced by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of factories, the pollutants of the river, are working
round-the-clock to meet the deadline of December 31 for installing
waste water treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
Those that fail to meet the deadline set by the central
environmental protection authorities will face production
suspension or close-down.
</P>
<P>
"The clean-up drive proceeds smoothly and I'm pretty confident
that we will attain the goal of cleaning the Huaihe River by the year
2000," said Qu Geping, chairman of the Environment and Resources
Committee under the National People's Congress, the country's
highest legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Qu, who is heading a NPC working group on an inspection tour
along the river, said the central government is determined to
clean up the river "for people's health and the sustained
development of the regional economy".
</P>
<P>
He said China has promulgated many laws and regulations on
environmental protection. "We should enhance the law
enforcement and supervision."
</P>
<P>
Local sources revealed more than 100 factory managers in
Henan Province, where the river originates, have been detained
on charges of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Qu stressed the importance to apply new and high
technology in environmental protection. "The success of cleaning
up the Huaihe River partly lies in whether we can achieve
technical breakthroughs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River, along which 150 million people live, spans
Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, the country's major
grain and energy base.
</P>
<P>
As China's biggest environmental protection project, the Huaihe
River clean-up will offer experiences for other pollution control
projects in the country, noted Qu, former director of the National
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said industrial projects which cause serious pollution
should not be built along rivers and in areas which lack
environmental protection technology.
</P>
<P>
The central government is considering closing up more small
factories that pollute the environment seriously, Qu
revealed.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise Sharply in Tokyo on Tax Cut News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stock prices closed sharply
higher Thursday on the news that the government will cut 2 trillion yen
(about 15.7 billion dollars) in income tax and residential tax to
stimulate the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 555.85 points, or 3.48 percent from
Tuesday's close to 16,541.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, rose 28.53 points, or 2.38 percent to
1,227.95.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 600 million
shares, up from Tuesday's 419.35 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Failed Yamaichi Securities was Thursday's most actively traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index, which remained weak in early trading, responded
quickly to the tax cut news.
</P>
<P>
When the news was reported at midmorning and confirmed by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at a press conference, the benchmark index
briefly soared more than 800 points.
</P>
<P>
The tax cut decision by Hashimoto, combined with a rumor that the
Bank of Japan intervened to sell dollars, stimulated the currency
market. The U.S. dollar had plunged more than 5 yen at one point to
the 125 yen level in Tokyo.

SINGAPORE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rallied on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
(STII) recovered by 7.76 points to close at 1569.51 points on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The higher finish overnight on Wall Street, some stability in
the regional financial markets, especially in Japan, and
bargain-hunting lifted prices of some blue chips, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
One institutional dealer said that there was some sympathy
buying during the day, as the market had come down so much.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume stood at 187.67 million units, valued
at 311.61 million Singapore dollars (186.59 million US dollars).
Declines continued to lead advances by 205 to 120, while 283 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
M. Resources was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 13.5 million units. It was followed by
Hotung which had 10.76 million shares traded. The Singapore
Technologies Engineering was next with 9.6 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by five dollars to finish at 33.5 Singapore
dollars. DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign increased by
70 cents to end at 14.5 Singapore dollars, while OCBC (Overseas
Chinese Banking Corporation) Foreign picked up by 60 cents to
close at 9.7 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, H Royal was the biggest loser as it declined
by 30 cents to end at 1.3 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sembawang and
the Singapore Airlines 200 fell by 20 cents to finish at 11.1 and
7.65 Singapore dollars respectively.

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Sanctions Committee
has approved the opening of a two-way passenger transport sea line
between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to the
Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted last night an Iraqi Trade Ministry source
as saying that the approval came in the light of a relevant request
made by the UAE recently to the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
There is already a goods transport sea line between Iraq and the
UAE, which has gained more importance as a result of the fact
that most Iraqi merchants tend to work in the UAE in view of the
facilities provided by the UAE for them.
</P>
<P>
The INA also said that the Saudi authorities would organize,
through a third party, special flights to carry the Iraqis who
plan to go to Saudi Arabia in the next Muslim pilgrimage season.

BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has received a second
ferry funded by the Danish government, the Mekong River Commission
said here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Presidential Race Seen Neck-and-Neck Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- With one day left before South
Korean voters go to polls to elect a man who will lead them to
overcome a serious financial crisis ailing the country, the
presidential race is viewed as a neck-and-neck competition among
the contenders.
</P>
<P>
The three-party competition is seen to be dominated by the duel
between Lee Hoi-chang of the Grand National Party and Kim Dae-jung
of the National Congress for New Politics because Rhee In-je of
the New Party by the People remains distant from the two.
</P>
<P>
Polls conducted last month showed that Kim, a veteran
opposition leader in the past decades, was leading with a marginal
advantage over Lee and Rhee.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts say the contest is far from giving a
prediction as undecided voters, estimated to account for 20
percent of the total voter turnout, will have a decisive impact on
the outcome of the country's 15th presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The undecided voters are classified into two groups. Those in
the first group may ultimately cast votes for either Lee Hoi-chang
or Rhee In-je as most of them are associated with the governing
party although Lee and Rhee, former members of the ruling party,
have denied any ties with President Kim Young-sam. The other group
of the undecided voters may vote either for Lee or for Kim.
</P>
<P>
Now, the three parties have been intensively campaigning in
populous Seoul and its neighboring areas, which are vital
constituencies with more than 45 percent out of the nation's 32.3
million voters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some analysts point out that it is the people from
the Kyongsang region with 27 percent of voters, a traditional base
of the ruling party, rather than the undecided voters, who would
have a definite influence on the election.
</P>
<P>
A split in the region would be of crucial benefit to Kim
Dae-jung, who reportedly has a majority in the Cholla areas and
enjoys a stable support of about 35 percent across the country.
</P>
<P>
Unless Lee secures more than 60 percent of the eligible voters
in the Kyongsang region, he might not reverse the result of last
month's polls to beat Kim's fourth bid for the presidency, say the
analysts.

HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
has pledged one million U.S. dollars to help Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia protect their wild tigers and other rare animals,
Vietnam's English daily "Vietnam News" reported Wednesday.

Measures to be taken include the building of cross-border
preservation areas, monitoring of tigers, training of
law-enforcement officers as well as the investigation of illegal
tiger trade.
</P>
<P>
Now, Vietnam has only some 150 tigers within its territory
because of over-exploitation of natural forests and
tiger-hunting. The number reached thousands in the 1960s.
</P>

The Vietnamese government has recently issued decrees strictly
banning the hunting of 36 rare animals species including elephant,
rhinocero, panther, five-colored monkey, spotted deer as well as

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Cut workforce Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Boeing, the world's
largest aircraft manufacturer, said today it plans to cut its
workforce by about 12,000 next year, according to reports from the
company.
</P>
<P>
The goal, said Boeing President Harry Stonecipher, is for the
company to be back on track in the second half of 1998 and then to
start cutting back further on extra people.
</P>
<P>
Boeing chairman Phil Condit also said there may be some
layoffs, but the company hopes to reduce its employment through
attrition.
</P>
<P>
The company has a workforce of 235,000 and normally loses some
11,500 a year through retirements and voluntary resignations.
</P>
<P>
Right now, however, the company is struggling to get jetliners
out the hangar door, paying large amounts of overtime and asking
employees to work through the Christmas holidays.
</P>
<P>
The company said it is on schedule to meet its target of
producing a total of 375 to 385 planes this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boeing commercial airplane group president Ron
Woodard said the company expects to deliver 550 planes in 1998 and
keep the same level in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, the company will be able to reduce
staff as it tapers its aggressive program of developing new
airplanes.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urges ASEAN to Crack Down Illegal Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Wednesday urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
to take a tougher stance against illegal drug trafficking in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Interior and Local Governments Secretary Robert Barbers said in
a statement that ASEAN countries must exert all efforts to combat
and prevent illicit cultivation, production, distribution and
abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries, he said, must not only focus on preventive
drug education, treatment and rehabilitation, law enforcement and
research to stem the tide of illicit drug trafficking in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Barbers' statement came on the eve of the three-day first ASEAN
Conference on Transnational Crimes to be held here, which will be
attended by interior and home affairs ministers of ASEAN member
countries.
</P>
<P>
"As part of our cooperative and collaborative efforts against
drug trafficking, ASEAN member countries must put more teeth to
the campaign by preventing and controlling the illegal production,
distribution and trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic
substances," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said the ministers attending the conference may study
or even adopt the memorandum of agreement forged by the
Philippines and the Lao People's Democratic Republic last October
which expanded the two countries' cooperation against illicit drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The two countries vowed in the memo to take measures to prevent
the production, distribution and trafficking of narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances as well as the diversion of precursors and
essential chemicals that may be used in the manufacture of the
banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said the memo may serve as a model for ASEAN since it
addresses the problem of illegal drugs and trafficking from its
very core which is the production and manufacture of banned
substances.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the conference will enhance
cooperation among ASEAN members against transnational crimes,
particularly drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering and
firearms smuggling.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- India has opened up its
non-banking financial services (NBFS) including stock-brokering to
foreign companies as part of a revised offer made to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), official sources said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO recently signed an accord on trade in financial
services in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government is expected to allow up to 51 percent
foreign equity in five areas of NBFS, while in stock-brokering it
would be 49 percent. The five areas are financial consultancy,
factoring, leasing, venture capital and merchant banking.
</P>
<P>
India has agreed to open 12 branches of foreign banks every
year on the most favored nation basis. In 1995, India only allowed
eight branches of foreign banks to operate in the country.
</P>
<P>
India's new offer was conditional as the total share of foreign
banks could not exceed 15 percent of the total bank branches in
India.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and joint-venture banks
in Vietnam have rapidly expanded their scope of fund mobilization
in both the domestic and international markets, a senior banking
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by "Vietnam News," Do Que Luong, acting governor of
Vietnam's State Bank, said the amount of the fund mobilization at
the moment totals 21,000 billion Vietnam dong (about 1.71 billion
U.S. dollars), or 19 percent of all funds raised by the banking
system in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding loans reached 19,000 billion dong (about 1.545
billion U.S. dollars), or 23 percent of the total lending by the
banking system, Luong said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the ratio of medium and long-term
credits has increased considerably to 35 percent of outstanding
loans by foreign and joint-venture banks.
</P>
<P>
Many new opportunities are available in Vietnam although
countries in southeast Asia are experiencing a monetary and
financial crisis, the acting governor said.
</P>
<P>
The laws governing the State Bank and credit institutions
approved by the latest session of Vietnam's National Assembly will
pave the way for a comprehensive legal framework for banking in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's State Bank also intends to design appropriate
mechanisms for a legal framework to help foreign banks utilize
their own strengths to ensure efficiency and expansion, the
official added.

Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who left Beijing for Kuala Lumpur December 14 as guest
of Dr. Mahathir Mohammed, rotating chairman of ASEAN and prime
minister of Malaysia, had also attended the informal summit

</P>
<P>
Local press held that to hold these summits on the occasion of

These links would serve to have an important and far-reaching
impact on the 21st century's development of east Asia and of the
China-ASEAN good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust, they said.
</P>
<P>
During the informal summit at the turn of this century, Jiang
and east Asian leaders expressed their optimism on the region's
development in the 21st century, and exchanged views on
strengthening cooperation between east Asian nations in regional
and international affairs before reaching an extensive consensus.
</P>
<P>
At this first ever top-level gathering between Jiang and the
ASEAN leaders, a joint statement had been signed as an important
fruit, which not only determined the principle to guide bilateral
relations, but also decided that the common goal in their policies
is to establish a good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust in
the forthcoming century, marking a new stage in China-ASEAN
relations.

<HEADLINE> China Lays Out Principles for State Enterprise Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's State Economic and
Trade Commission described the principles behind its reform of
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises for the next three
years at an annual economic and trade conference which ended here
in Chengdu today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister of the commission, told the three-day
conference that the problems have been made much clearer and that
reform guidelines and principles have taken shape after years of
reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, whose goal is to set up a modern enterprise system
with these enterprises, are a cornerstone of China's economic
reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
The state has taken concrete measures like strategically
regrouping state enterprises, taking care of the reforms of big
state enterprises and letting small ones take care of the reform
of themselves, encouraging mergers, standardizing bankruptcies,
moving redundant workers to other jobs, and developing
re-employment programs.
</P>
<P>
All measures have been approved by China's highest
decision-making body and efforts have been made to provide a
foundation for accelerated reforms in the next three years, he
said, adding that the successful macro-economic readjustment
measures of the Chinese government have meant a soft-landing for
the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
The relatively good supply of energy, raw materials, and
produce, the improved transport conditions, the better fiscal
situation, and the more open macro-economic environment all
provide solid guarantees for future reforms.

<P>
A number of large, cost-efficient and strong state enterprises
and enterprise groups will emerge from the competitive market to
sustain China's future economic development, and continue the
enterprise reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Another thing that favors state enterprise reforms is the fact
that people have seen the difference of markets, competition, and
risk-prevention after years of reforms and can stand the pressure
better and can better understand, support, and participate in the
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The state enterprise reforms in 1998 will focus on establishing
a mechanism whereby strong entities win out and weak ones fail,
and the central government will allocate 40 billion yuan, 10
billion yuan more than this year, for large and medium-sized state
enterprises to write off non-performing and bad loans.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state plans to raise 100 billion yuan by
issuing stocks to back up reforms, with key state enterprises the
first to do this, and companies are encouraged to take over
companies that still have difficulties, he said, and the
government will continue to encourage the involvement of foreign
capital in state enterprises.

BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists, professors,
engineers and doctors remain the most prestigious professions in
the Chinese people's eyes, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
So, writers, artists, fashion designers, pop singers and
models have fallen in status, according to sociologist Li Qiang of
People's University in Beijing, who did the survey and compared
the results with those of a similar one in 1990.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life show the same respect for
scientists and professors because they regard technology and
education as a very important thing, Li was quoted by today's
"Beijing Youth Daily" as explaining.
</P>
<P>
And, farmers and servicemen got more respect than fashion
models, real estate agents and businessmen, the survey show,
because people think the former contribute more to the country
than the latter, Li says.
</P>
<P>
Reporters, editors and TV and radio hosts ranked 21st, 22nd,
and 23rd among the 30 most prestigious professions, coming in
ahead of people in sports and movie director, but behind
economists, lawyers, and musicians.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Internet Benefits Chinese University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Since the campus network of
the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) with 30
sub-networks went on line in 1995, 70 percent of total computers
in the university have so far been hooked up with Internet,
including over 30 service units and more than 1,600 small
computers, work stations and terminals.
</P>
<P>
The network utilization in the USTC, one of China's most famous
universities based in east China's Anhui province, topped all the
other universities in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, Internet has promoted the cooperation
and exchanges between USTC and its international counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Through Internet, Chu Yaoquan, director of USTC's Astrophysics
Research Center, participated in some international research
programs such as the design of "Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber
Spectrum Scopy Telescope" which involved hundreds of domestic and
overseas scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
"Without Internet, it's unimaginable that we can undertake such
a state-of-art work." Professor Chu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that they often conduct on-line discussions with their
overseas partners on Internet, which ensures the smooth progress
of the program.
</P>
<P>
On-line discussions have also helped USTC and its long-term
cooperation partner, Japan High Energy Physics Research
Institution, increase their academic cooperation. When Japanese
counterparts worked at USTC, they can manage their work in Japan
through Internet.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of Internet, USTC has overcome its inadequacy in
some scientific apparatus in research. China's National
Synchrontron Radiation Lab based in USTC, now is able to analyze
its research data effectively on its American counterpart's
computers via Internet.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Internet has become a major information channel to
researchers in USTC and stepped up their pace with the latest
academic development.
</P>
<P>
In disciplines of astrophysics, nuclear physics and information
science, researchers extracted an average of some 300 updated
scientific abstracts per month from data bases on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
USTC President Tang Honggao said that his university will
respond to the latest research development in the world within no
more than three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, using Internet to select textbooks and to seek the
suggestions from academic authorities at home and abroad in
setting curriculums resulted in improvement in USTC's teaching and
research programs.
</P>
<P>
In the coming three years, USTC is to invest 7 million yuan in
its computer webs so that it will make full use of Internet and
campus web resources.

PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Paris Wednesday had its first
snowfall before this Christmas of more than two centimeters
high covering most of the capital region.
</P>
<P>
The Departmental Direction of Equipment (DDE), which is in
charge of snow-clearing, began to clear the main axis this
morning, but most of the secondary roads remain extremely slippery
and several accidents took place, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The snow is expected to hold on to the ground because of the
low temperature under two degrees minus centigrade.
</P>
<P>
The DDE said that the snowfall was unexpected and most of the
roads cannot be cleared until mid-day Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Parents Warned Against Overweight Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health experts are
cautioning young parents about the calorie and fat of their
infants because the incidence of obesity among Chinese children is
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
A study in Shanghai showed that 4.25 percent of the children in
the 0-6 age group are overweight, and half of the overweight
children suffer from high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Their parents' ignorance about a balanced diet is a major cause
of obesity in children, according to today's "Wenhui Daily", which
carries the results of the study. It found that most parents did
not regard their children as being "overweight".
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that overweight children have a higher
tendency to have cerebral problems, diabetes, high blood pressure,
and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
About 70 million Chinese, mostly city dwellers, are obese and
the number is on the rise as people's standard of living has
improved in recent years. Many people put on the unwanted pounds
because they do not do regular exercise, or sleep too much, and
eat food that is high in fat and calories, experts say.

<HEADLINE> Over 90 Die of Cholera in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of
cholera victims in Zanzibar has exceeded 90, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zanzibar has reported a steady decline in the number
of patients and deaths in the last 24 hours. Only one was
reported yesterday morning, indicating an improvement of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's Health Minister Said Bakari Jecha told reporters
that by Tuesday, 79 people had died in several health centers in
Zanzibar town while 12 had died at home.
</P>
<P>
Jecha said the epidemic is an east African affair, having
stretched from Somalia in the north to Mozambique in the south.
He said a regional conference to deliberate on the epidemic will
soon ben held in Nairobi, capital of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
A study, done by the Ministry for Health, has revealed that
the main source of the epidemic was the lack of toilets and waste
disposal pits.
</P>
<P>
The minister named some of the most affected areas as
Makadara, Mwembemakumbi, Mwembeladu and Migombani where most
households do not have latrines. The government will conduct a
house to house inspection to determine which family does not have
a latrine.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has acquired 100 tons of medicine from
businessmen and international organizations, include antibiotics
and drip fluids, which are enough to cope the current situation.
Meanwhile, the government has banned all private hospitals to
treat cholera patients.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour has sent a message of
condolences to relatives and friends of people who have been
killed in the outbreak of cholera during the past two weeks in
the Indian isles.

<HEADLINE> Most Iranian Women Favor Family Planning Programs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A research shows that 69
percent of married Iranian women favor family planning programs
in the country, local newspaper Iran Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The research which was conducted in a four-year span on 8,309
married women aged under 49, shows that 91.8 percent of married
Iranian women agree with family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
About 5.2 percent urban women and 13.5 percent rural women
oppose family planning methods, the research indicated, advising
the government to offer constant training to encourage men to
participate in family planning.
</P>
<P>
The research noted that birth control systems would improve
the living conditions at a macro level and increase hope for a
better life.
</P>
<P>
Small families will find the way to address their needs
and choose a proper way of life while expanded families will
always face a huge spectrum of unmet needs, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran started a policy of family planning programs at the
beginning of the 1990s after the country's population growth rate
boomed up over 3 percent, as a result of birth encouragement
during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that its population growth rate has dropped down
to 1.6 percent, but some specialists believe it to be around
1.8-2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper warned earlier this year that the population
growth rate in Tehran province around the country's capital
city of Tehran was as high as 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that the country, Tehran province in particular,
would face a serious population explosion in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Iran's population was reported in contradictory ways.
U.N. population specialists predicted it at 65 million while the
Iranian government announced that it is less than 60 million at
present.

<HEADLINE> 25 Anniversary of Sino-Australian Ties Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia will
launch a program of technical cooperation assistance to China as
an effort to cement the Australian-Chinese cooperation, said
Australian Prime Minister John Howard here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement at a reception to mark the 25th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It is an appropriate occasion to announce that the Australian
government has agreed with China on a program designed to make
available Australian expertise in public sector management," he
said. "The program will begin next year and will be worth up to 20
million Australian dollars over four years."
</P>
<P>
He said that the program will provide for Chinese governmental
agencies to draw on the technical expertise of a range of
Australian counterpart agencies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever Australian approaches are relevant for China, these
will be transferred or adapted as required," Howard added.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, attended the
reception.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation for the decision, saying that the
program will have a positive impact on the growth of the bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
When recalling the development of Sino-Australian relations in
the past 25 years, Li said that thanks to the concerted efforts of
the two countries, encouraging achievements have been scored in
the friendship and cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries have been in constant contact with
each other, and steady progress has been made in economic ties and
trade, Li said, adding that the bilateral educational, cultural
and other exchanges have been expanding.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the two sides have enjoyed sound consultations
and cooperation on many major international and regional issues.
The Australian government has always stuck to the "One China"
policy, listed China-Australian relationship as one of its major
important bilateral ties, and supported China's accession to the
World Trade Organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China and Australia share common interests and
common responsibility in safeguarding world peace and promoting
stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Since Australia is an economically developed country in South
Pacific while China is the world's largest developing country, the
two economies are highly complementary, which promises great
potentials and a broad prospect for mutually beneficial
cooperation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"It can be said that China needs Australia and vice versa," Li
pointed out. "I am convinced that by celebrating the 25th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, our
bilateral ties will be promoted to a new phase of development and
a more brilliant chapter will be opened in the coming new
century."
</P>
<P>
Howard said that the Australian-Chinese relationship is built
very firmly under the two pillars of common interests and mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries are very different societies with
very different histories and political systems, the bilateral
relations have always been "at their very best", he added.
</P>
<P>
Australia and China are "very natural partners" in economic
cooperation, he said, adding "the common participation of the two
countries in the International Monetary Fund's assistance packages
for both Indonesia and Thailand has underlined the character of
our partnership in the Asia-Pacific region."

<HEADLINE> China Reports Success In Changing Oil Development Focus (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region will maintain an annual growth rate of 13.5
percent in oil production and will produce 16.47 million tons of
crude and 2.1 billion cu.m. of gas this year, according to a local
official.
</P>
<P>
Shu Liang, who is in charge of co-ordinating oil production in
the Tarim, Junggar and Turpan-Hami basins in the region, said
Xinjiang has become a key oil production base with rapid increases
in proven oil reserves and crude oil output, and the region is now
making up for the decreases in oil production in the eastern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
A recent oil and gas report said that the three basins, which
are 740,000 sq.km. in size, have 35.7 billion tons of petroleum
and 2.2 billion cu.m. of gas, accounting for 30 percent and 34
percent of the country's total respectively.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry of China, which now produces more than 140
million tons of crude oil a year, has been stymied by inadequate
oil reserves. In the eastern part, which provides 80 percent of
the country's oil output, the oil reserves have been declining by
20 million tons annually, and oil production costs in some
oilfields have risen rapidly.
</P>
<P>
So, China has turned to its western areas for new resources,
beginning in the early 1990s, and oil-gas exploration in the
three basins has entered a prosperous period thanks to the efforts of
the 100,000 oil workers in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead in Kenyan Election Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Kenyans have been killed
with 62 injured and 50 arrested over election-related violence
countrywide since November 15, local press reported today, 12
days before the poll which will take place on December 29.
</P>
<P>
The dead included a woman killed in Mathira Constituency
during a clash between supporters for the ruling Kenya African
National Union party and the Democratic Party, and an
unidentified person killed in Githunguri in similar
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
A total of 78 incidents of violence were reported during the
period, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Geoffrey Mwathe
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured were four security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi has the highest number of arrests at 24, followed by
Nyanza Province at 18, Coast six, Central Province five, Rift
Valley four and Western three, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he discounted claims that most of those arrested
were opposition supporters, saying the suspects came from all
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The police is dealing with violence firmly and impartially, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Violence affects everyone, the innocent and the culprits. In
the end, the election will not be free and fair. If we believe in
democracy, we should not encourage violence," Election Commission
Chairman Samuel Kivuitu also emphasized Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 15 presidential candidates had requested and been
given round-the-clock security. Those who have not applied
include aspirants from FORD-People, Kenya, UPPK, FORD-Asili and
Umma.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, 74 and in power
for 19 years, is widely expected to win his last campaign with
five-year more tenure largely due to the division of the
opposition.

<P>
Oil and gas exploration by the China National Petroleum and Gas
Corporation has led to the discovery of 28 industrial oil-bearing
structures and ten gas fields in the Tarim Basin, and 4.4 million
tons of crude oil is expected to be produced there this year, a
rise of 42 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
A gas exploration team from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral
Resources has discovered in the northern part of the Tarim Basin a
gas field with a production capacity equivalent to 370,000 tons of
oil.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas exploration in the Karamay Oilfield in the Junggar
Basin has expanded, and four major oilfields, each with 100
million tons of oil reserves, have been found.
</P>
<P>
Oil output in Karamay has been increasing by 400,000 tons a
year and will reach 8.7 million tons this year, maintaining its
position as China's fourth largest oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Oil exploration in the Turpan-Hami Basin started much later but
developed quickly, and, in the past seven years, 20,000 oil workers
have discovered seven industrial oil-bearing structures and 14 oil
and gas fields in the basin, with an annual capacity of 3.5
million tons of crude oil and 900 million cu.m. of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that the basin will be able to produce three
million tons of crude oil and supply Urumqi, the capital of
Xinjiang, with 600 million cu.m. of gas this year for
urea production.
</P>
<P>
According to the China National Petroleum and Gas Corporation,
China has planned to find four billion tons of oil reserves and
510 billion cu.m. of natural gas resources, and produce 23
million tons of crude oil and three billion cu.m. of gas in the
three basins by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
By then, Xinjiang's oil will account for 20 percent of China's
total output, compared to the present 11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Li Ruihuan Meets Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
leader Li Ruihuan told Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer here today that China appreciated the efforts made by the
Australian government to promote Sino-Australian relations.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Downer, Li, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said the relations as a whole have been
developing smoothly during the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
A good momentum emerged in the Sino-Australian relations this
year, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples the Australian government's adherence to
the One-China policy, Downer's presence at the swearing-in
ceremony of the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region on July 1, and Australia's first
White Paper on Foreign Affairs and Trade issued in August, which
lists Sino-Australian relations as one of its most important
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The positions adopted by the Australian government on a series
of major issues have laid a good foundation for the development of
the economic cooperation between the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difference in social systems and ideology, China
and Australia are both located in the Asia-pacific region and
share extensive common interests in safeguarding peace and
promoting economic prosperity and development, the Chinese leader
said.
</P>
<P>
"China is confident of the future development of
Sino-Australian relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating Downer on his recent successful China visit, Li
said the trip by the foreign minister to China and his
participation in activities marking the 25th anniversary of
Sino-Australian relations had shown the importance the Australian
government attached to the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He told Downer that it was one of his aims to have a better
understanding of Australia so as to better learn from the country.
</P>
<P>
Li said creative people should always notice not only the
strong points of its own, but also those of others so as to
improve itself and make constant progress.
</P>
<P>
The failure of a people to notice the good points of its own
would result in a lack of confidence, thus losing the desire to
stand on one's own feet in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Losing sight of the strong points of others and always finding
the weak points of others would lead to the failure to remove its
own weakness, improve itself and finally lag behind others, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that he agreed with Li, adding the friendly
cooperation between Australia and China has been developing very
rapidly in various fields particularly in economic and trade
fields during the past 25 years since the two countries
established diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the two countries had also made
successful cooperation on many regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Australia hoped the good momentum in the bilateral relations
would continue and was willing to do more in this regard, Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Chinese leader also met with representatives of
local Chinese and Australian-Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Fails to End Nurses'Strike by Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Hopes of resolving the
nurses' strike across Kenya have been dashed after talks between
governmental officials and representatives of the striking nurses
broke up in discord Tuesday, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, under the chairmanship of Chief Nursing Officer
Margaret Ngure, lasted about two hours and ended in a deadlock
when the government said it could only make measures to solve the
crisis after the December 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
In response, the National All Cadres Nurses Steering Committee
vowed to intensify the strike and called for a demonstration
march in downtown Nairobi today, the 20th day of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The nurses were demanding up to 500-percent pay hike but the
government only agreed a 20-percent increase, saying there is no
money to pay nurses higher salaries under the current economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
But the nurses accused governmental officials of lacking
seriousness in solving their problems because "senior government
officials were busy with the political campaigns."
</P>
<P>
"We have been too lenient in asking for what is our right but
now we have no option other than applying the language which the
government best understands -- demonstrations!" said a strike
leader Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most public hospitals have been crippled around the country
with patients unattended since the strike were launched on
November 28.

<HEADLINE> High Infant Death, Malnutrition Plague Nepal: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa said here today that despite the government's
efforts to provide for basic health and nutritional needs of
children, the twin problems of high infant death and malnutrition
continue to plague the country.
</P>
<P>
"Most notable problems are the protein-energy malnutrition in
young children and iron deficiency causing anemia in women," said
the prime minister while addressing a ceremony held by the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to release a report called the
State of the World's Children 1998.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation, the Nepali government has constituted
a very high-level National Women and Children Development Council
for the protection and promotion of the causes of children and
women, he said.
</P>
<P>
And the government has initiated programs for distributing
Vitamin A supplements twice a year to all children under the age
of five and promoting iodization of salt and breast feeding, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Children account for 16 percent of Nepal's total population of
21.6 million, and half of them are malnourished and half stunted,
said the UNICEF report.
</P>
<P>
The report which focuses on the issue of nutrition identifies
protein-energy malnutrition, Vitamin A deficiency, iodine
deficiency disorders, iron deficiency anemia and zinc deficiency
as the main nutritional problems in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A report released on the occasion by the Nepali government said
that four national studies over the last 20 years reported on the
level of malnutrition in young Nepalese children and there is
little evidence of improvement.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Holds Third Session on Pullback, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet held its
third session this morning to deliberate the further redeployment
and guidelines on permanent talks with the Palestinians, following
Tuesday's session which turned into a shouting game.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was the last session held before the Thursday
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held under the shadow of a deepening inner rift
within the government over drawing a final map on the planned
redeployment in the West Bank and the final-status talks with the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA). No final decision was
expected until mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that Tuesday's session turned into
a shouting game between Netanyahu and the hawkish National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, who accused the prime
minister of sacrificing Israeli security interests for the
pullback plan.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly shouted back at Sharon: "Don't wave your
finger at me."
</P>
<P>
Sharon indicated that he would no longer support the
government if his proposal for the further pullback and
final-status talks is not accepted by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Sharon proposed creating one 10-15 kilometers security zone
east of the Green Line to divide Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas, and another 20-kilometer-zone along the Jordan
Valley. He also called for retaining control over the water
sources and all Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharon's proposal, Israel will maintain control over 70
percent of the West Bank in the final settlement. His plan
was supported by Science Minister Michael Eitan, Agriculture
Minister Rafael Eitan, Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky, and Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu, together with Foreign Minister David Levy, was
reported to favor the plan proposed by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, who recommended narrowing the width of the two planned
security zones along the Green Line and Jordan Valley to three to
six kilometers and seven to 10 kilometers respectively. Under
Mordechai's proposal, Israel will retain control over 50-55
percent of the territories in the final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai and Levy insisted that Israel's holding on to less
territories would help promote the chance of advancing the peace
process. Both of them favored earlier withdrawal in order to win
diplomatic points for Israel to get out of the international
isolation caused by the stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy told Netanyahu if he was not serious in carrying out
the redeployment, he would turn down Netanyahu's invitation to
travel together to Paris to meet Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said Tuesday that Netanyahu would
only update Albright on the latest Israeli internal consultations
when they meet in Paris, without giving a specific percentage
of the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu would also present
Albright a 12-page report on what is called the PNA's
antisemitism and incitement against Israel in violation of the
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The radio said Netanyahu is gaining understanding from the
United States that he needs more time to delay the second
redeployment until mid-January after winning the Knesset
(Parliament) approval of the 1998 Budget, which is facing strong
opposition from both the ruling and opposition camps due to
massive budgetary cuts.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has to rely on the rightwing parties' support to
get the budget through the Knesset at the end of the month,
otherwise his government will fall. If he pushes hard now for
the approval of the controversial redeployment, the rightists will
take advantage of the budget vote to pressure Netanyahu to
cancel it.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy Growth Rate Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's gross domestic
product (GDP) is forecast to grow 3.6 percent this year, down
from 4.6 percent last year and 4.8 percent in 1995, local reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) estimated that average annual
inflation stood at 8.5 percent in 1997 from 9.0 percent last year
and annualized month-on-month inflation at 7.3 percent from 10.8
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves in the eastern African country was expected
to rise slightly to 1.315 billion U.S. Dollars from 1.299 billion
last year, according to the bank's monthly report for December.
</P>
<P>
Some 736 million Dollars, or three months of imports cover,
were official reserves, representing a decline from 855 million
Dollars or 3.6 months imports in official reserves last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to October, tourism incomes dropped by 21 million
Dollars to 428 million Dollars. Tourism is the country's biggest
foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in tourism earnings was partly due to the ethnic
unrest in major tourist resort areas which scared away potential
tourists and partly due to intense competition from other tourist
destinations," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy also suffered a shock in July when the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) halted a key aid package worth
205 million Dollars, causing an outflow of investors from the
equity and money markets.
</P>
<P>
The central bank noted the IMF suspension was responsible for
a fall in official long-term capital inflows by 163 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Debt service in the country currently makes up 21.5 percent of
exports of goods and services with external debt totaling 6.3
billion Dollars, official statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> Unit Cotton Output Sets Record in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The per hectare output of cotton
in east China's Shandong Province rose to 900 kg this year, a new
record it has set since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The total cotton output of Shandong reached 350 million kg this
year, 22 million kg less than last year's figure as a result of a
big reduction in sowing area.
</P>
<P>
But the province government has allocated six million yuan in
popularizing new cotton varieties and building high-yield
fields. And tangible results were received in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Shandong was the largest cotton producer in China during the
period from 1980 to early 1990s. Its output of cotton used to make
up a quarter of the national total. However, its total and unit
outputs and sowing areas of cotton dropped sharply since late
1980s. The per hectare output even plummeted to 450 kg in 1992.

<HEADLINE> China's Revenue Up 23 Percent For 11-Month Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's fiscal condition
continued to improve in the first 11 months of this year, with
revenues outstripping expenditures by 6.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli told a national financial
meeting today that and both revenues and expenditures of central
and local budgets will exceed budgeted figures, while the deficit
in the central budget will be held within the budgeted figure of
57 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's national revenues grew 23.2 percent year-on-year in the
first 11 months, compared with a rise of 16.4 percent for
expenditures during the period, Liu said, explaining that growth
of taxes slowed down in that period, with value-added tax revenues
up 11 percent, consumer tax up 10 percent, and business tax up
28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, taxes on securities
trading surged 355 percent over the same period of last
year. During that period, personal income tax, private enterprise
income tax, and foreign-funded enterprise income tax grew 36.6,
44.1 and 36.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the slowdown in the growth of the major
taxes was one of the major problems in the fiscal sector, which
include delayed payment of taxes by enterprises and fiscal
pressure caused by bad bank loans to enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liu told the meeting that China will continue to follow a
moderately tight financial policy next year and will step up
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The central government will increase transfer payments to
underdeveloped areas, Liu said, and urged departments to make a
greater effort to improve fiscal and spending controls.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Come Up With New Explanation For El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A new explanation for the El
Nino phenomenon - that it is the result of hot water flowing in
the oceanic crust - has come from the Geochemical Institute
(GCI) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Scientists there believe that there is a large amount of water
in the earth's crust that is no less than that contained in the
hydrosphere, or the earth's water envelope and that each year the
amount of water entering the sea from the oceanic crust is a tenth
of the amount of surface runoff.
</P>
<P>
The high temperature water in the crust is very active,
especially under the mid-ocean ridge, and generally accompanies
earthquakes and volcanic activities. This movement is caused by
cool sea water that seeps into the oceanic crust through fissures
along the mid-ocean ridge and is gradually heated by lava flow,
leading to water convection which forces the hot water back into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that about 20 to 25 percent of the earth's heat
is dissipated in this way. GCI researchers explain that the hot
water flow in the eastern Pacific, near the mid-ocean ridge is
more violent than in the western part, causing a great deal of hot
water in the eastern Pacific, and when it reaches a certain
temperature, it affects the atmosphere, producing El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The scientists reached the conclusion after analyzing
environmental effects by monitoring soil temperatures resulting
from hot water flow in the crust. They discovered that soil
temperatures in China's coastal area increase when earthquakes in
the western Pacific occur.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be the result of intense movement of the
Pacific Plate, which triggers earthquakes and stimulates more
violent hot water flow in oceanic crust as well, which in turn
raises the soil temperature.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have found that floods in China's coastal areas are
closely related to the rise in soil temperature. Flooding usually
occurs six months to a year and a half after the soil temperature
increases.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Industries Expect Lower Growth: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Prospects are dim for some
domestic industries next year as high interest rates and a weaker
peso will continue to take their toll on the growth of these
industries, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a study made by a group of economists of the
Manila-based University of Asia and the Pacific as saying that
construction will particularly slow down as a number of players
decided to postpone their investment plans.
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the slowdown to higher costs of imported
fuel and machinery equipment and higher interest payments on
commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
It said high interest rates and the already perceived softness
in the real estate market will also further pull down sales in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Banks, it said, will be reluctant to expand real-estate loans.
The peso devaluation will also cause construction costs to rise,
another factor that will keep a lid on growth in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Energy is another sector to be hardest hit by the peso
depreciation as some new entrants may slow their investment plans
for the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But textile manufacture, footwear and wearing apparel
industries, which experienced deceleration during the past few
years, are all seen to recover due to their lower prices on the
export market.
</P>
<P>
The study, however, warned against the government's plan of
reducing tariffs, which, it said, could affect gains of the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The report further said that car sales which are in a slump
after the peso depreciation, may also dampen the prospects of the
rubber manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, manufacturing industries are seen to
recover in 1998 with a growth of 4.8 percent, thereby pushing
industrial growth to 5.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth of the services sector will still be high at 6.56
percent in 1997 and 6.69 percent in 1998 despite the slowdown in
real estate, it predicted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: COMESA's Progress in Trade Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Southern
and Eastern Africa (COMESA) has made considerable progress in
trade development and promotion in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The annual intra-COMESA trade jumped from 834 million U.S.
Dollars in 1985 to 1.7 billion Dollars in 1994 and is expected to
reach 4 billion Dollars soon.
</P>
<P>
Since it was established in December 1994 to replace the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) set
up in 1981, the COMESA has taken many measures to promote trade
among its member states.
</P>
<P>
COMESA tariffs have been reduced on the average by 70 percent
while some member countries have already reduced their tariffs by
80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of tariffs will definitely give a big
competitive edge to the products of the sub-region compared to
those from non-COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA member countries have also eliminated all the major
non-tariff barriers to intra-COMESA trade such as restrictive
import licensing, foreign exchange allocation and tax on foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA rules of origin have been liberalized and
streamlined in order to facilitate preferential trade and
encourage foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Now even products produced by enterprises which are owned and
managed totally by foreigners can enjoy COMESA preferential
tariff treatment provided they qualify under any one of the four
criteria of the COMESA rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
A schedule of common external tariff of zero, five, 15 and 30
percent on capital goods, raw materials, intermediate goods and
final goods respectively have been worked out and a COMESA
customs union will be set up by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The common external tariff will provide the business community
with a level playing ground in the COMESA market for competition.
</P>
<P>
COMESA have also implemented a number of programs to promote
trade, including supply and demand surveys, buyers and sellers
contact meetings, trade information services, enterprise-specific
assistance and trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
These programs have helped some companies identify trade
opportunities and improve their competitiveness. As one of the
outcomes of the programs, five general and two specialized trade
fairs as well as the buyers and sellers meetings have generated
over 800 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has established the PTA Trade and Development Bank to
mobilize financial and technical resources for investors and for
trade financing; the COMESA Clearing House to promote
intra-COMESA trade transacted in member countries; and the COMESA
Re-insurance Company.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate trade in the subregion, the Automated
System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) has been installed in many
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The system accompanied by the simplification and harmonization
of procedures and documents assists in clearing goods faster from
customs, in generating up-to-date and accurate statistics on
international trade, and increasing the revenues of the member
countries because of more efficient and effective assessment and
collection of duties and other taxes on imports.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate intra-COMESA trade, the sub-regional
grouping has also installed EUROTRACE in most member countries.
EUROTRACE is computerization of foreign trade statistics.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA decided last month to set up a court of justice to
provide interpretation on the provisions of the COMESA treaty and
ensure that the member countries comply with the COMESA timetable
of program implementation.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the court of justice to be a whipping
institution for backsliders may help COMESA achieve its main
objectives to assist the member states in attaining rapid and
sustainable economic growth and development, and to promote joint
development in all fields of economic activity and the joint
adoption of macro-economic policies and programs.

<HEADLINE> Foreign, Joint-Venture Banks Expand in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and joint-venture banks
in Vietnam have rapidly expanded their scope of fund mobilization
in both the domestic and international markets, a senior banking
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by "Vietnam News," Do Que Luong, acting governor of
Vietnam's State Bank, said the amount of the fund mobilization at
the moment totals 21,000 billion Vietnam dong (about 17.1 million
U.S. dollars), or 19 percent of all funds raised by the banking
system in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding loans reached 19,000 billion dong (about 15.45
dollars), or 23 percent of the total lending by the banking
system, Luong said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the ratio of medium and long-term
credits has increased considerably to 35 percent of outstanding
loans by foreign and joint-venture banks.
</P>
<P>
Many new opportunities are available in Vietnam although
countries in Southeast Asia are experiencing a monetary and
financial crisis, the acting governor said.
</P>
<P>
The laws governing the State Bank and credit institutions
approved by the latest session of Vietnam's National Assembly will
pave the way for a comprehensive legal framework for banking in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's State Bank also intends to design appropriate
mechanisms for a legal framework to help foreign banks utilize
their own strengths to ensure efficiency and expansion, the
official added.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Economy Expected To Do Well In Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Even though Macao's economy
has lagged behind Chinese inland areas and Hong Kong in recent
years, it is expected to see a turn around through industrial
restructuring, according to some economists.
</P>
<P>
Macao's advantages for economic growth are that it is adjacent
to Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, and that its road, water, and
air transport network, and free port status are good for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Real estate, tourism, banking, and export-oriented
manufacturing have long been four pillar industries, but, because
its economic structure is not so good, its economy slowed down,
economists say. Manufacturing accounted for only 26 percent of the
local output value last year, compared to 36 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Because of other problems in recent years, income from tourism
and gambling, its largest source of government revenues, was also
down a great deal.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying to simplify investment procedures and
improve service to get more foreign investment, and has put
several billion pataca into large scale projects to improve the
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Funds from inland areas, which are the largest investor in
Macao, have played an important role in economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Human Genes Introduced Into Sheep to Get Insulin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
introduced human genes into sheep as a source of insulin from
their milk.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was done in the Nanshan Sheep Bio-technology Lab
and the Hutubi Livestock Bio-engineering Research Center in
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which are part of the
Ministry of Agriculture's Livestock Bio-technology Open Lab.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the two labs injected fragment of human DNA into
sheep sperm and bred sheep using artificial insemination in the
hopes that they could produce sheep carrying human genes.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, they succeeded in breeding 18 sheep from which a
source of insulin could be extracted. A year later, when the sheep
lambed, scientists were able to extract 16 milligrams of human
proinsulin from a liter of the milk, which could further be
refined into insulin, for use in treating diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The two labs have 77 of the genetically altered sheep,
including the 18 that produced the human proinsulin.
</P>
<P>
The gene-transfer technology has made it possible to produce
large amounts of human protein, and insulin, efficiently and
inexpensively. Experts say that because there is no way to
mass-produce protein medicines in China at present, this insulin
extraction method may mean a breakthrough in diabetes treatment in
China.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO statistics, only cardiovascular diseases and
cancer exceed diabetes in the number of occurrences in the world.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Unveil Plan for Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that he would announce his plan in the next few days on
whether to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia beyond June, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a year-end press conference, Clinton said he will
announce the plan before he flies to Bosnia on Sunday to visit
U.S. troops stationed there.
</P>
<P>
"We are discussing now...both within the administration, with
our allies in NATO and our other allies, and with Congress what
should be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been caught between pressure
from many Congressmen who want a timely pullout and from Europeans
who say the peace mission in Bosnia will collapse if the Americans
leave.
</P>
<P>
Any further deployment of U.S. troops in Bosnia will have to be
approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
"I think one of the things that all of our military people
agree on is that we must do more to beef up the civilian police
there and that there must be a distinction between what we expect
our military leaders to do and what we expect the civilian police
to do," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that if there is to be a mission after the
withdrawal, "it also must have clear objective components with
some way of knowing whether the mission has been achieved or not."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies currently deploy altogether 30,000
troops in Bosnia, 8,000 from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the so-called Stabilization Force (SFOR) expires
in June.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Assistance for Three Developing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
approved three credits and a loan totaling 123.3 million
U.S. dollars to Egypt, Eritrea and Guinea for their development
projects.
</P>
<P>
A credit of some 15 million dollars and a loan of 20 million
dollars are earmarked for Egypt's Pollution Abatement Project.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of this pilot project are to strengthen the
monitoring and enforcement capabilities of the environmental
institutions and establish technical and financial mechanisms for
pollution abatement investments in Greater Cairo, Alexandria, and
the two Suez Canal cities of Suez and Ismailia.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of some 18.3 million dollars will be used for an
Eritrea health project.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to contribute to reductions in infant
and under-five mortality rates, maternal mortality ratio, and
total fertility rate as well as prevalence rates of malnutrition
in women and in under-five children, tuberculosis, malaria and
some other diseases.
</P>
<P>
The third credit of some 70 million dollars is to help
Guinea's public expenditure management adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The project is an integral part of the World Bank's strategy to
help Guinea ensure financial sustainability and improve public
service effectiveness in sectors which benefit the majority of the
poor.
</P>
<P>
Another objective is to help this west African country overhaul
the whole management of its budget as a serious first step towards
improving governance.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
wing for developing countries.

NANNING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, one of China's leading fruit producers, harvested 3.18

<HEADLINE> Old Chinese Revolutionary Base Uses Oil Industry To Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Oil has become a major part of
the economy of Yan'an, the old Communist revolutionary base in
Shaanxi Province in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The city is expected to produce 2.8 million tons of crude oil
by the end of this year, an increase of 800,000 tons from 1996,
according to Vice-Mayor Xiao Changhua. Taxes paid by the oil
industry now account for at least 60 percent of the city's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The Yanchang Oilfield, which has the first oil well drilled on
the Chinese mainland, was transferred to Yan'an's administration
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The city government has been placing great emphasis on
exploration and has preferential policies to encourage it and
technical improvements. An oil refinery has also been built nearby.
</P>
<P>
Yanchang and the Changqing Oil Exploration Administration have
transferred some old wells or isolated oil-bearing structures to
counties for development, and given full support in technology and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Ten county-level exploration companies have been established so
far. They have brought in at least 200 retired technical experts
and 100 million yuan in capital, and have produced more than
600,000 tons of crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Timber Industry Accused of Using Soft Money to Keep Road Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A United States private
environmental group has accused the timber industry of using large
amount of "soft money" in securing funds for constructing logging
roads in national forests this year.
</P>
<P>
"Timber interests tripled their soft-money spending in 1995-96,
a move that seemed to help them gain leverage with Congress," said
Common Cause President Ann McBride Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soft money is largely unregulated contributions to promote
party-building and other efforts not related directly to
individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
McBride said that senators who voted in September against
cutting off the roads spending received an average of 27,337
dollars in contributions since 1991 from the American Forest &AMP;
Paper Association (AFPA) and the political action committees of
its member companies.
</P>
<P>
The amendment by Senator Richard Bryan failed 51-49. A similar
measure in the House fell short 211-209.
</P>
<P>
The industry gave 1.5 million dollars in soft money to parties
in 1995-1996 -- up from 481,960 dollars in 1993-94 and 345,120
dollars in 1991-92, a Common Cause report said, adding that
environmental groups fighting the logging roads gave no soft money
during the period.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the road program say it amounts to a subsidy to the
timber industry. It reimburses companies for road-building costs
with credits they can use to bid on new timber sales.
</P>
<P>
AFPA spokesman Frank Stewart said Tuesday that the trade group
was reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
AFPA President W. Henson Moore had said in the past that the
program is the most efficient way to construct roads that are used
for fighting fires, recreation and local traffic as well as
logging.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just wondering if Common Cause is saying the 1.6 million
timber workers and their families that we represent shouldn't have
a voice in Washington?" AFPA spokeswoman Kate Watson said. "We are
playing by the same rules our critics play by."

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government today
decided to merge two state-run energy companies into a new
energy group, the largest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The merger of the Nes te Oil Company and the Imatra Electric
Power Company, with 80 and 100 percent of their shares controlled
by the government respectively, is aimed at strengthening the
competitiveness and adaptability of the country's state-owned
energy enterprises in the increasingly open North American and
European markets.
</P>
<P>
Nes te and Imatra, which recorded a sales volume of 43.4
Finnish markkas (12.1 billion U.S. dollars) billion and 12.1
billion Finnish markkas (2.28 billion U.S. dollars), respectively,
last year, will be grouped into the country's largest energy
company, with a total workforce of 16,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The new company, analysts say, can take advantage of its highly
internationalized status to explore the international markets of
energy products and technology and consulting service.
</P>
<P>
Finland adopted the policy of reforming its state-owned
companies in 1995 when the current government came to power.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Unveils Drastic Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>

TOKYO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto announced Wednesday a plan to implement special tax cuts of 2
trillion yen (about 15.7 billion dollars) in the fiscal 1997
supplementary budget to stimulate the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an emergency press conference, Hashimoto said that the
step is designed to prevent the economic problem "originated in Japan
from causing global depression."
</P>
<P>
He said the government will issue deficit-covering bonds to finance
the tax cuts, which will be implemented only for one year.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's announcement turned around the sentiment of the Tokyo
stock market. The key Nikkei index, which was lower in the early
morning, responded quickly to the news about Hashimoto's announcement,
briefly soaring more than 800 points.
</P>
<P>
The news also circulated in other financial markets, bolstering the
yen's value against the U.S. dollar and pushing down prices of
long-term Japanese government bonds.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua)-- India's anti-evasion
directorate has launched nationwide search operations of a "winter
collection drive" for the Revenue Department.
</P>
<P>
Starting with four major automobile manufacturing companies
Tuesday, the directorate is expected to zero in on the white goods
industry in its second round as part of an overall collection
drive, local newspaper Business Standard said today.
</P>
<P>
The Directorate-General of Anti-Evasion (DGAE) Tuesday searched
the offices and factories of four major automobile companies in
the country for alleged excise evasion.
</P>
<P>
The searches were conducted simultaneously in 16 different
centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to DGAE sources, the alleged excise evasion relates
to compulsory after-sales services and compulsory warranty
reportedly borne by dealers who were offered high margins by the
automobile companies.
</P>
<P>
"Many more companies will reel under this collection drive,"
said a senior directorate official.

<HEADLINE> Finland's Population Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Finland's population reached
a record high of 5.147 million in mid-December, an increase of 0.3
percent over the past year, according to latest data released by
the Finnish Statistics Center.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60,000 babies were born in 1997, the largest single-year
number since 1973, the Statistics Center. However, Finland's
natural birth rate is still among the lowest in Europe, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 240,000 people have migrated across the
country so far this year, including thousands moving from rural
areas and remote regions to Helsinki, Tampere and other southern
cities.
</P>
<P>
At present, about two million people, or 40 percent of the
country's total population, are living in the province of Uusimaa
around the capital city.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, two-thirds of the country's territory is
uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
This pattern of population distribution not only brings great
pressure on employment, transportation, education and
infrastructure facilities of big cities but also has an
unfavorable impact on the regional balance in development.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua)-- India's Commerce Ministry is
planning to set up a new International Trade Office in the country
to specially deal with the issues of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) as a permanent body, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The thinking in the government is that there should be a
permanent body to deal with issues related to the WTO which is
governed by several complex agreements contained in the final
Dunkel agreement.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Commerce Ministry looks after all the
agreements with a small team of 4 to 5 persons headed by a single
joint secretary. The team changes all the time with transfers and
promotions of the officers.
</P>
<P>
While the Commerce Ministry is the nodal ministry for WTO
dealings, the agreements require active coordination among
different ministries.

Cheng Yan was just new to the building on the day there was
some operational failure in the elevator. As she walked toward the
elevator door on the 11th floor, she heard someone talking inside
the shaft, and an elevator repairman who was working in the shaft
asked her to help by holding the door open. As she was trying to
help him, she took a wrong step, lost her balance, and fell into
the empty shaft.

</P>
<P>
Smith finished with 879 coaching victories, surpassing the 876

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Report: Six Million Children Die of Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Around six million children die
across the world every year as a direct or indirect result of
malnutrition, the U.N. children's fund UNICEF said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of malnutrition on the world's children was the
center piece of UNICEF's 1998 report, which was released today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that despite the alarming number of children
lacking adequate nourishment, the problem was rarely considered an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
"The children that suffer from malnutrition often don't feel
hunger and they show very few signs of disease," the report said.
"And yet this killer is responsible for over half the annual child
deaths in the world."
</P>
<P>
"Half of southern Asia's child population is malnourished," it
went on to say. "In Africa one in three children was born
underweight and in some areas there were even worse cases of this
kind."
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that malnutrition at an early age is often
linked to chronic illness in adult life, the report said.

<P>
KIEV, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has destroyed 68 SS-19
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and 107 ICBM
launchers, a senior Ukrainian military official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Nikolai Goncharenko, director of
the inspection center of the armed forces, said Ukraine plans to
further destroy 62 such missiles and 20 launching devices for
SS-24 ICBMs, the Ukrainian Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint statement signed by Russia, the United States and
Ukraine in 1991, Ukraine should destroy all the 180 SS-19 and 46
SS-24 missiles deployed within its territory by the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The total number of conventional weapons deployed within
Ukraine does not exceed the limit set in the Treaty on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, the military official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty signed between the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and six former member states of the
Warsaw Pact, Ukraine is allowed to have 4,800 tanks and 5,050
armored vehicles in its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Goncharenko also denied the possibility of utilizing the
launching devices for agricultural or industrial purposes.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's Nationality Law to Go into Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's senior
representative to Bosnia Carlos Westendorp announced at Sarajevo
Tuesday that the Nationality Law of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina will soon become effective.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp made the announcement when the Bosnian parliament
failed to reach an agreement on the law.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Westendorp has exercised the power
vested in him by the committee for the execution of the Dayton
Peace Agreement. The agreement states that Westendorp can make
decisions when the three Bosnian parties fail to agree on relevant
issues.
</P>
<P>
According to Westendorp's decision, the law will go into effect
on January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian parliamentary conference held at Sarajevo Tuesday
passed the Council of Ministers Law and the Passport Law, but did
not reach an agreement on the issue of dual nationality in the
Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp notified in writing the presidency of the Republic
of Bosnia, which includes Alija Izetbegovic, Kresimir Zubak and
Momcilo Krajisnik, about his decision.
</P>
<P>
He stressed in his letter that it was agreed during the Bonn
meeting that the Bosnian Nationality Law would be passed. His
decision, he said, will continue to be effective until the Bosnian
parliament comes to an agreement concerning the law.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp asked the parliament to make a statement to
acknowledge the Bonn meeting agreement on dual nationality in
compliance with the Constitution of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp stresses in his letter that he will continue to make
full use of his power to ensure compliance with the Dayton Peace
Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sets NATO Summit in 1999 for New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
would hold a summit in Washington in the spring of 1999 to welcome
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a year-end press conference, Clinton said, "the
entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the alliance
will make America safer, NATO stronger, and Europe more stable and
united."
</P>
<P>
"The United States has led the way in transforming our
alliance; now we should be among the first to vote yes for NATO's
historic engagement," he added.
</P>
<P>
In July, the 16-member alliance agreed to invite Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to join by 1999, the NATO's 50th
anniversary. The agreement needs to be ratified by the parliaments
of the members.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the foreign ministers from the alliance signed
formal accession documents to begin the process of accepting these
countries as new members.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate will vote early next year on the alliance's
expansion plan. Clinton had promised to seek an approval.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministers' Salaries Cut by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a 20 percent salary cuts for all of its members,
including the prime minister, ministers and deputy ministers,
according to a Government House press release available today.
</P>
<P>
The salary reduction, to be effective from this month and in
force for 12 months, will save more than a million baht (21,600
U.S. dollars) from public spending.
</P>
<P>
The reduction is part of the government's efforts to cut public
spending to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund,
which it set for the provision of the 17.2 billion dollar bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
The pre-cut official salary for the prime minister was 64,000
baht, or about 1,385 dollars at the current exchange rate, while a
minister earned 62,000 baht (1,340 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Members of Parliament are also considering a similar move.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tripartite wage committee Tuesday decided on
increases in the minimum daily wage for next year.
</P>
<P>
A five-baht hike will be effective in Bangkok, Phuket and five
other provinces near the capital, raising the minimum wage for
these seven places from 157 baht to 162 baht.
</P>
<P>
A three-baht increase will be applicable to six provinces,
where the current minimum wages are 137 baht, and a two-baht
increase for the rest 63 provinces of the country to raise the
minimum wage there to 130 baht.

<HEADLINE> China Values New Nuclear Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- While the world's leading
nuclear power suppliers are muscling their way into the potential
vast Chinese market, China said yesterday it will select partners
through public bidding, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zide, deputy director with the nuclear power office under
the State Planning Commission, promised that such bidding will be
"fair, open and just."
</P>
<P>
He told a seminar yesterday in Beijing that the selection of
foreign partners will be based on such principles as the technology
must be safe, advanced and mature; foreign partners must transfer
their technologies; foreign partners must be those with which
China can establish long-term co-relationships; and the
co-operation must be mutually beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China plans to design its own nuclear technology,
manufacturing , construction and operation through localization of
foreign technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese nuclear power circles paid great attention to
the progress of the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor(ABWR), developed
by General Electric (GE), Hitachi and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
Although none of China's existing two nuclear power plants and
the four designed to be constructed in the Ninth Five-year
Plan(1996-2000)adopted boiling water reactor, China does not rule
out the possibility of introducing such reactors in the future, a
GE official said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Re-imposes Cap on Dollar Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers' Association of the
Philippines has re-imposed a 2 percent cap on banks' selling rate
of U.S. dollars for over-the-counter (OTC) sales.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted Deogracias Vistan, president
of the association, as saying that this means banks can not sell
greenbacks OTC at a price 2 percent more than that of the previous
day's weighted average foreign exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which took effect on Tuesday, was meant to keep
banks from profiting excessively from the weakening peso, Vistan
said.
</P>
<P>
The move came as some banks had been selling dollars at rates
between 40 to 45 after last Thursday when the peso started sinking
into new record lows.
</P>
<P>
The peso hit a new low of 40.214 to the dollar from an opening
of 39.44 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By re-imposing a limit on price spreads, the association hopes
to narrow the gap between banks' buying and selling rates and
thus, help ease speculative pressures against the peso, Vistan
said.
</P>
<P>
The association first implemented a 4 percent ceiling which was
later reduced to only 2 percent upon the central bank's request.
</P>
<P>
The ceiling was totally scrapped in early August when the
initial panic had lost steam and the differential between the
rates at the official markets and the parallel markets narrowed
down.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Stresses Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
stepped up environmental protection to ensure the steady
development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the Regional People's Congress has adopted 20
regulations on environmental protection, wildlife protection, land
use and urban construction.
</P>
<P>
The region has taken environmental protection as an important
task in industrial production, building grains production bases,
and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
New regulations prohibit construction of paper mills with
an annual capacity of less than 5,000 tons and heavily-polluting
factories.
</P>
<P>
Existing heavily-polluting enterprises are adopting new
technology and equipment, in order to bring pollution control to
state-set standards within a given time.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Central Government and other parts of the
country, Tibet has established the Regional Environment Monitoring
Station, and similar stations in Xigaze and Qamdo prefectures. The
stations conduct regular monitoring of air quality, water quality,
noise and polluting sources on the Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has established an environment research institute, which
has carried out research into local soil environment, the standard
of natural radioactivity in local environment and industrial
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Tibet Regional Bureau of Environmental
Protection said that by the end of this century, some 90 percent
of the region's industrial waste gas will have been treated, and
45 percent of solid waste will have been used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
They said, by then, climate environmental quality will meet the
first-class standard set by the state and the per-capita green
space will reach eight to 12 square meters.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, grass will be planted on a total of
300,000 mu (20,000 hectares) of land and one million mu (some
66,666.66 hectares) of grassy land is expected to be improved, in
a bid to better protect local arable land and ecological
environment.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Sustainable Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tourism experts called for
sustainable tourism development at a seminar that closed here
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
They urged department concerned to rationally and efficiently
explore tourism resources in China, protect the environment, and
promote the sustainable development of tourism at the two-day
seminar jointly held by the China National Tourism
Administration(CNTA), The State Science and Technology Commission
(SSTC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the World Tourism
Organization, China will rank first in the world in the number of
overseas tourists with the arrival of 137 million in the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
However, although China is a big country endowed with rich
tourism resources, its per capita tourism resources are
insufficient, pointed out Liu Yanhua, an official with SSTC.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China's per capita forested area only
ranks 121 in the world. And its per capita beach resources are
lower than the average amount of the countries with seashores.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an increasing number of tourists flock to
suburban scenic spots, and other well-known scenic sights, causing
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
Due to the destructive exploration of the tourism resources in
some places, the deterioration of the ecology has constituted a
serious threat to the current and potential tourism resources. As
a result, the sustainable development of tourism in China should
attract the attention of all of the society, experts at the
seminar held.
</P>
<P>

<P>
QUITO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Countries of the Andean
Community submitted a proposal Tuesday to the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) for the gradual exemption of tariffs for 15-18
years to help establish a free trade agreement between the two
blocs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Child Farm Workers' Health Threatened by Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Across the United States,
tens of thousands of children work in a sea of toxic chemicals
whose long-term health effects are almost completely unknown.
</P>
<P>
Government standards for pesticide residues in the nation's
food supply are set with special attention to the children who eat
that food. Yet those who work in the fields receive pesticide
doses many times higher than the law allows in American diets.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody stands there with a straight face and talks about
protecting children, and they don't do anything to protect child
workers," The Associated Press quoted Marion Moses, a pediatrician
with the Pesticide Education Center in San Francisco, as saying.
"I don't think that we should be dosing children very early in
life with toxic chemicals."
</P>
<P>
An unreleased U.S. Department of Labor survey shows that
123,000 children between the ages of 14 and 17 work in the U.S.
fields. Uncounted thousands more are under 14, according to an AP
report.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting the health of our children is one of our highest
priorities," Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol
Browner told a conference of doctors and scientists in September.
</P>
<P>
But until this year, the federal government spent next to
nothing for occupational health and safety research on child farm
workers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health did
hand out 2.5 million dollars for research on injuries to child
farm workers, but the effort pales next to the 700 million dollars
the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service
spends each year on crop and livestock studies.
</P>
<P>
Children on farms occasionally suffer severe pesticide
poisoning, sometimes fatally.
</P>
<P>
Such confirmed incidents of acute pesticide poisoning are rare
-- or at least rarely reported. Of greater concern to experts is
long-term, low-level damage that can show up decades after a child
has picked his or her last berry.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to late-in-life exposures, exposures to pesticides
early in life can lead to a greater risk of chronic effects that
are expressed only after long latency periods have elapsed," a
National Academy of Sciences committee said in a 1993 report.

KIEV, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Small political parties in
Ukraine are becoming more aggressive in their campaigns for the
approaching parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
New and relatively unknown parties have successfully qualified
to participate in the race.
</P>
<P>
The Central Electoral Committee said on Tuesday that a number
of new parties, such as Women of Ukraine, The Greens Party and
Reforms and Order, have already gathered the Minimum 200,000
signatures needed to qualify for the parliamentary election
scheduled on March 29-30 next year.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that our party, which is clean, non-criminal and
not financed by Western funds, will eventually gain support." said
Alina Komarova, leader of the Women of Ukraine, which was founded
in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mykhail Pavlovsky, spokesman for Reforms and Order, a Party

topping the party's ticket that convinced people to lend their
support, rather than any particular platform.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's export
value went up 13.4 percent over the first nine months of this year
compared with that of the corresponding period last year, the

</P>
<P>
Exports from January to September reached 8.49 billion
U.S. dollars as compared with 7.67 billion dollars for the same
period in 1996, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports amounted to 11.1 billion dollars, compared
to 10.13 billion dollars in 1996, which resulted in a trade
deficit of 2.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The main export product was coffee, which reached 1.65 billion
dollars from January to September, compared with 1.11 billion
dollars last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Supplements Better Children's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nutrition experts from the
Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine suggested yesterday that
proper multi-vitamin supplements may help children develop better.
</P>
<P>
The academy presented the results of its research tuesday in
Beijing at a national experts meeting to discuss the relationship
between vitamins and children's development, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 experts attended the meeting and voiced their
concern over child nutrition, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The experts reached their conclusion after studying 10,000
children aged four to nine in Beijing, 7,000 from the urban area
and the rest from three counties in Pinggu, Huairou and Shunyi
districts.
</P>
<P>
The children investigated were divided into two groups, one
given vitamin supplements, the other only taking vitamins through
meals.
</P>
<P>
A comparison showed that in just two and a half months, the
group with vitamin supplements grew 0.1 to 0.5 centimeters faster
than those not taking supplements.
</P>
<P>
Although there was little difference in weight, the blood
vitamin content was much higher in the supplement group, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that about 18 percent of the children in
each group suffered from a lack of vitamin C before the research
began. The rate dropped to 0.4 percent in the group with
supplementary vitamins and to 15 percent among children in the
non-supplement group.
</P>
<P>
Fewer children got sick after taking vitamin supplements, said
Yin.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Ministry of Health suggests that most
Chinese, including children, have enough to eat, but malnutrition
still exists due to dietary imbalance.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that about 35 percent of Chinese children
below the age of five have failed to reach national indices for
physical development such as weight and height. The rate was as
high as 50 percent in some poor areas.
</P>
<P>
A number of children suffered from various malnutrition-related
ailments such as rickets and anaemia, which could impair their
physical health and intelligence.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Only Child More Able Than Conceived </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey result defies a
generally-held conception that people without siblings are less
able or sociable than those from multi-born families.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by sociologists and population experts
among 1,200 one-child families in Tianjin, one of the most
populous cities in China. The siblingless people surveyed are in
one to 46 age bracket.
</P>
<P>
It found that people from one-child families are better
educated. Each person aged between six to 20 is receiving education
that matches his or her age and 73.5 percent of them aged 21 or
above have received college education.
</P>
<P>
The only child is stereotyped as unable to take care of
themselves in daily life. They are psychologically weaker and less
enterprising and sociable than their peers from multi children
families.
</P>
<P>
The survey, however, shows that these people's ability to handle
daily-life needs are increasing as they grow up. By age 21, little
difference has been observed between them and people with sisters
and brothers in this regard.
</P>
<P>
A total of 34 out of 100 one-child surveyed said that they
would push ahead despite of setbacks and frustrations. 87.6
percent of the parents surveyed said their one-child gets along
quite well with them, their relatives and classmates.
</P>
<P>
Yet the survey found that people from one-child family who are
confident in overcoming setbacks and frustrations outnumbers those
who feel upset by 7.4 percentage points.

GUANGZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Many Guangzhou residents are

</P>
<P>
The 50-day exhibition, the largest of its kind in China,
provides knowledge of AIDS with more than 1,000 pictures and 20

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China yesterday signed an agreement in Beijing to authorize the
Bank of China (BOC) to handle its 1.1 billion yuan (about 132.5
million US dollars) loan to a power project in Chongqing,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, BOC will act as the agent bank
responsible for the issue and recalling of the loan while
supervising the use of the fund.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used for the second phase of construction of
the Luohuang Power Plant in Chongqing, said a BOC official.
</P>
<P>
Involving a total investment of 4.76 billion yuan, the project
will build two thermal power generating units with 350,000
kilowatt capacity each.
</P>
<P>
The project will also include the construction of a
310-kilometer-long, 220-kilovolt power transmission line.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion at the end of next year, the power plant will
have an annual power generating capacity of 1.4 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The plant will ease the electricity shortage in Chongqing and
be a powerful boost to its economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Not to Favor Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
today that he would not favor any proposals for lifting sanctions
against Iraq unless it complied with U.N. resolutions on weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Clinton
said, "There are those that would like to lift the sanctions.... I
am not in favor of lifting sanctions until he (Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein) complies."
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to maintain the sanctions as long as he does not
comply with the resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
A crisis, which began late in October when Saddam ordered
American weapons inspectors to leave Iraq for their spying, is
still staying in the Gulf as the United States keeps mighty
military forces in the region and Iraq refused U.N. inspectors
access to "presidential areas" for weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, chief U.N. weapons inspector, failed to
persuade Iraqi officials to enter these sensitive sites on his
four-day trip to Baghdad and returned to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He will present a report on his Baghdad mission probably on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry called Iraq's refusal "the
latest episode, saying Saddam "has blocked access to sites in the
past."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the United States would decide how to respond to
Iraq's refusal to the access to those presidential areas after
seeing Butler's report to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman also said the United States would
first "see what the final UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) report
to the Security Council is."
</P>
<P>
"The latest Security Council resolution calls for full
unrestricted access to all sites that UNSCOM deems necessary. But
the council has to decide what to do about it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market to Face Correction in 1998: Merrill Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The recent deterioration in
the world's equity markets may be a sign that the post-1994 global
bull market is facing additional correction in 1998, according to
the U.S. consulting firm Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
The firm's chief market analyst Richard McCabe is of the view
that a four year cycle low is likely to occur in 1998 following
those in 1994 and 1990, Merrill Lynch said today in a newswire
service report.
</P>
<P>
McCabe predicted that a correction which could bring the major
averages down as much as 25 percent would likely set the stage for
the next bull market advance to begin in late 1998 or 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. GDP growth is expected to slow to about 2.5 percent
in 1998 after growing nearly 4 percent in 1997, the firm said,
adding that the Asian financial turmoil should reduce U.S. growth
by at least half a percentage point next year.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation, falling interest rates and slower growth will
be the environment for investors globally in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring and consolidation are seen as major sources of
earning growth for most companies.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch suggested that airlines, financials, selected
energy and capital goods could be among "the industries in the
throes of consolidation."

<HEADLINE> Sick Leave Costs Metropolitan Police 72 Mln Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Sickness and injury cost
London's Metropolitan Police 72 million pounds (117.4 million US
dollars) last year, according to a National Audit Office study
published today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that on average 1,520 officers out of a total
27,000 were absent due to illness or injury every day last year
and almost 400,000 working days were lost because of sick leave.
</P>
<P>
Officers in the Metropolitan Police took an average of 14.4
days of sick leave last year, compared with a national average of
eight days.
</P>
<P>
The report urged Scotland Yard to examine how its sick-pay
system works, saying that long-term sickness and medical
retirements have been rising throughout the 1990s although
injuries on duty have fallen.
</P>
<P>
The audit office accepted that police officers face additional
strains because of an onerous and occasionally dangerous job, but
said that "high levels of sickness absence tend to reduce
efficiency. They may also lead to declining morale."

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Turkey Should Be Anchored to West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today stressed that Turkey should be anchored to the West and its
disputes with Greece over should be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very important that we do everything reasonable
to anchor Turkey to the West," Clinton told an end-of-the-year
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the size of the country, if you look at its
geostrategic significance, where it is, what it could block and
what it could open the doors to, it is terribly important,"
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) decided last week not to take Turkey
into the list of potential candidates for its membership. An angry
Turkish government threatened to freeze its relations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the EU decision would sour relations between
Turkey and Greece, who have a long dispute over the the East
Aegean Sea and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is terribly important for us to do everything we
can to resolve the differences between Turkey and Greece," said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that "to allow the potential that Greece and
Turkey both have" for future cooperation in every field "to be
broken on the rocks of their differences over Cyprus and other
territorial differences in the Aegean" is "a grave error."
</P>
<P>
"And so I will be talking to Prime Minister Yilmaz about this.
I want a resolution of the Cyprus issue very badly," he noted.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Fail to Reach Key Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's political
parties today failed to reach agreement at their last meeting this
year.
</P>
<P>
The province's Protestant and Catholic leaders could not agree
on a list of key issues. But they said they would resume
broadly-based talks in January.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the multi-party talks and former U.S. senator
George Mitchell said he was disappointed but denied that it meant
the death blow to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that pro-British Protestant and pro-Irish Catholic
groups were now even more determined than ever before to move the
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
"It is not what we hoped. It is disappointing but it is by no
means a disaster, by no means fatal," Mitchell told a news
conference. "The process will go on and I am confident that the
process is going to succeed."
</P>
<P>
The two major rival parties -- the Ulster Unionist Party and
Sinn Fein -- accused each other of failing to agree on issues to
be addressed when the peace talks restart in January.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party, the chief Protestant group, accused
Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army, of refusing to agree to discuss the creation of a Northern
Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein countered that it was prepared to discuss
anything that was of relevance to any other party.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland have set a May 1998 deadline for parties to
produce a peace package, and then put the outcome of the talks to
referendums in both parts of the divided island.

<HEADLINE> Three IRA Guerrillas Jailed for London Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Three Irish Republican Army
guerrillas were jailed to a total of 62 years in prison today for
plotting to launch a major bomb attack on London.
</P>
<P>
Brian McHugh, 31, was jailed for 25 years, Patrick Kelly, 31,
was given 20 years and James Murphy, 26, was sentenced to 17
years. The three were also convicted of possessing explosives.
</P>
<P>
Michael Phillips, 22, was cleared by the jury at London's Old
Bailey criminal court of the same charges.
</P>
<P>
Diarmuid O'Neill, 27, was shot dead by police when they
arrested the group in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The gang was plotting a "devastating" lorry bomb attack on
London but the plan was foiled by the police.
</P>
<P>
The group were arrested after an earlier IRA cease-fire broke
down in February 1996 with a massive bomb attack in London's
Docklands area.

<HEADLINE> Large Heart Gene Database Compiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) --The first large heart gene
database has been compiled by an international group of scientists
from China, The United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to an AP report from Dallas, the database of 46,000
genes could be helpful to find better diagnosis and treatments for
cardiovascular diseases like high blood pressure and heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
With four years' efforts, the scientists have identified about
80 percent of the genes that control the growth and development of
the heart and blood vessels, said the group leader C. C. Liew of
Toronto University.
</P>
<P>
They also unearthed those genes that lead to cardiovascular
abnormalities and disease.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's President Calls For Peace, National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir today urged the governors of the 10
southern states to work for national unity and safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the 10 governors,
al-Bashir also called on them to liberate the lands under rebel
control and defend liberated territories.
</P>
<P>
He described the present time as a historic phase in Sudan for
building peace and a new country free from foreign interference,
which is not what John Garang dreams of.
</P>
<P>
Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the major
southern rebel group, has demanded a confederation of northern half
of Muslims and southern half of mostly Christians be set up, which
has been rejected by the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
The governors of the southern Sudanese states have been elected
recently as part of the effort to implement the Khartoum peace
agreement signed between the Sudanese government and six minor
southern rebel factions last April.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a referendum will be held at the end of a
four-year transitional period by the southerners, who will retain
freedom of religion, press and assembly.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also offers a coordination council to the
southern states during the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Rayak Mashar, chairman of the coordination council, has said
that the governments of the southern states will start to work
after the Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Greece to Conditionally Support Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today reiterated that his country would back Turkey's
European orientation if Ankara played by the rules.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after briefing Greek political leaders on EU's
Luxemburg conference, Simitis said that Athens did not want the
exclusion of Turkey or any other country from cooperation with the
Eropean Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The decisions of the EU, he explained, was that this
cooperation should be based on "rules of the game."
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU was in fact asking Turkey and the other
countries to strengthen their cooperation with the organization in
order to avoid possible problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
As for possible threats by Turkey to escalate tension in the
Aegean Sea or annex the northern part of Cyprus, the premier said
that if Turkey was to take such a step, the country would only be
harming itself and would most likely make its entry into the EU
impossible.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Turkey to intensify its pressure throughout the
process of negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the EU in order
to secure "favorable decisions" for Ankara itself.
</P>
<P>
After its failure to be named candidate for the EU membership
in Luxemburg last week, Ankara accused the EU of discrimination
and threatened to end political talks with EU and integrate the
northern part of Cyprus into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today also warned
that it would be "a terrible mistake" if Turkey further "upgrade"
its relations with northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Ankara's relations with northern Cyprus
were already very advanced, both in the economic and military
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that his country was ready to confront any
further Turkish initiative in this direction.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Up, Compassion Down, Says Advocacy Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Ten years after the signing
of federal homeless assistance legislation, homelessness is on the
increase in the United States, said The National Coalition for the
Homeless.
</P>
<P>
The coalition said that since homelessness is often a temporary
circumstance, rather than a permanent condition, it is difficult
to calculate the number of people affected. A 1996 study estimated
760,000 people are homeless on any given night.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 29 cities released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
showed 20 percent of all requests for emergency shelter went unmet
due to lack of resources.
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Gleason, executive director for the coalition, said
the public's anger and fear of those living on the streets is
misplaced, since public policy is forcing people from jails and
foster homes onto the streets and into shelters.
</P>
<P>
Gleason said, "What we do is create the homelessness, and then
we get mad that these people are so visibly poor on our streets."
</P>
<P>
Barbara Duffield, director of education for the coalition,
disputed the notion that many homeless could get jobs if they
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
Duffield said, "Try to get a job when you're homeless. Of ten
times, employers will reject people who don't have a permanent
address, who haven't been able to take a shower, who haven't been
able to print-up their resume. There are some real practical
barriers to employment."
</P>
<P>
Gleason said many homeless are employed, but don't make enough
money to pay rent. She suggested Congress fund job training,
low-cost housing and substance-abuse treatment.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Slashes Opposition Parties at Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAFIKENG, South Africa, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing
president of South Africa's ruling African National Congress, Nelson
Mandela, today vented fire on opposition parties at the ANC national
conference.
</P>
<P>
The National Party (NP), the Democratic Party (DP) and the United
Democratic Movement (UDM) received most of his bullets and the Freedom
Front, Pan Africanist Congress and the Azanian People's Organization
were also attacked.
</P>
<P>
In a marathon 53-page presidential speech, Mandela described the
NP, DP and the UDM as "a miserable platoon of opponents" to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout its years as the ruling party, and before, the National
Party consistently pursued the strategic goal of the destruction of
our movement and organization," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
After the ANC came to power, the NP had not abandoned this
objective, he said. "The leopard has not changed its spots."
</P>
<P>
"Its only problem is that it lacks the power it once had, to pursue
this aim. Accordingly, it is involved in a desperate search to find
the ways and means to destroy its historic enemy, to enable it to
discharge its responsibility of defending white privilege."
</P>
<P>
As for the DP, Mandela said the party had sought to present itself
as the most effective parliamentary opposition to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party, which has no policy differences with the NP,
has sought to position itself as an implacable enemy of the ANC, and
on this basis, to convince NP supporters to switch allegiance to
itself."
</P>
<P>
"They both believe that their fortunes lie not so much in policies
they can propagate, but in their success in projecting themselves as
tireless fighters for the defeat of the ANC."
</P>
<P>
Mandela laid harsh criticisms on the UDM, led by former ANC leader
Bantu Holomisa and NP leader Roelf Meyer.
</P>
<P>
"The latest political grouping to join the miserable platoon of
opponents of our movement is the United Democratic Movement of Bantu
Holomisa and Roelf Meyer."
</P>
<P>
More vigorously than the DP, it had also sought to convince some NP
supporters that the UDM offered a more credible non-racial political
home than the NP.
</P>
<P>
"Inevitably, it will draw into its ranks some of the most backward
and corrupt elements in our society which have no interest whatsoever
in promoting the interest of the people," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The NP fought back today, saying that Mandela's speech was
unstatemsman-like and paranoid.
</P>
<P>
"We would only hope that the paranoia which characterized much of
his speech is not indicative of government thinking," said executive
NP director Renier Schoeman.
</P>
<P>
More attacks from other parties are expected.

<HEADLINE> Two-Million-Year-Old Fossils Found in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Fossilized remains of two
hominid babies believed to be about two-million-year-old have been
found in South Africa's Gauteng Province, South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by South African and French paleontologists
early in August this year, the French Embassy announced today.
</P>
<P>
Research indicated that the remains were those of a child less than
three years old when it died.
</P>
<P>
"This individual belonged to the genus homo and is the first fossil
baby of such high antiquity ever found," the embassy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The find consisted of both maxillae (frontal facial bones including
jaw and cheek) a permanent tooth and a frontal bone.
</P>
<P>
The remains were those of a baby paranthropus or robust
australopithecine.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the development of the teeth, this individual was a
tiny baby when it died -- perhaps less than a year old. It is by far
the youngest baby of an early hominid ever found and it will throw a
great deal of light on development of the facial region..."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Panel Suggests Separate Barracks for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A Pentagon advisory panel
today recommended U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force put male and
female recruits in separate barracks and segregate men and women
in their earlier phases of basic training.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member panel also called for toughening basic training
and physical fitness standards for both men and women, and urged
the Pentagon to increase the number of female trainers.
</P>
<P>
The move is to improve morale and curb sexual harassment of
women in the U.S. military following a number of Army male drill
sergeants convicted of harassment and rape of women recruits.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon stressed that the Army, Navy and Air Force will
continue joint training of men and women.
</P>
<P>
But the panel called on the services to appoint more female
trainers and to provide those trainers with better instruction on
sexual awareness.
