<HEADLINE> EU to Enforce Directive on Personal Data Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's executive body, said Friday that the directive on
protection of personal data will enter into effect on October 25,
1998.
</P>
<P>
European commissioner for the single market, Mario Monti, said
implementing the directive is good news for individuals who will
enjoy safeguards concerning personal data, and economic operators
who will benefit from the free flow of information and the boost
to consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I am of course disappointed that some member states are
lagging behind on implementing the directive in national law. I
will not hesitate to open infringement procedures against them,"
Monti said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed however that the directive will be applicable from
October 25.
</P>
<P>
The directive, as the European Commission claimed, will
establish a clear and stable regulatory framework to ensure a high
level of protection for the privacy of individuals in all EU
member states and the free movement of personal data within the EU
area.
</P>
<P>
In most European countries, personal data protection is a
constitutional principle and the right to privacy is written in
the European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, until now, differences between national
protection laws have resulted in obstacles regarding the transfer
of personal data between member states.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the directive lays down common rules, which
will be observed by those who collect, hold or transmit personal
data as part of their economic or administrative activities, or in
the course of the activities of their association.
</P>
<P>
There is an obligation to collect and process personal data
only for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and to
ensure that such data is relevant, accurate and up-to-date, it
added.

<HEADLINE> UK Considering to Close Down Some Diplomatic Posts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering to close a "limited number" of its embassies, high
commissions and consulates, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman Friday confirmed there
would be such closures, but she said no firm decisions had been
taken and a document acquired by the Times newspaper listing 30
possible closures was merely a working paper.
</P>
<P>
"No decisions have been taken and no options have been
submitted to (government) ministers," the spokeswoman was quoted
by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman stressed that the Foreign Office had said in
early July that it would be closing down posts in some places
while strengthening Britain's diplomatic presence in others.
</P>
<P>
"We are now looking at the options for a limited number of post
closures," she said.
</P>
<P>
A Times report said that eight diplomatic posts have been
recommended for closure and a further 22 candidates are still
under consideration.

<HEADLINE> Duma Chairman Satisfied with Sino-Russia Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma Chairman
Gennady Seleznyov said on the eve of his visit to China
that relations between the Russian and Chinese parliaments
are stable.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov was scheduled to visit China from October 25 to 30.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua news agency, Seleznyov said the
main purpose of his China visit is to discuss with Chinese leaders
the possibility of expanding cooperation between the two
countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said he and Chinese leaders will also discuss the
possibility of increasing bilateral cooperation in various areas,
including politics, economy, trade, science, technology, as well
as military affairs.
</P>
<P>
The current trade and economic cooperation between Russia and
China has great potential, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the border trade between the
two countries in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
While Russia is experiencing a severe economic crisis, China
and Russia are working out a plan to increase food trade in the
Far East, Seleznyov noted, adding that the plan will bring new
vigor to Russian-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Chinese reform in the last 20 years,
Seleznyov said China has created "an unusual economy" through the
20-year-reform. China has not copied others economic model, but
has its own character.
</P>
<P>
He said though China has a population of over 1 billion
population, it has been able to resolve the problems of feeding,
clothing, educating and employing its people. China has proven
itself to be amazing with the rapidly increasing rate of the gross
national product.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said he regarded China as a nation of workers, a
nation of creators, and a nation where people's living standards
are being improved.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Agreement Reached, But Then Snagged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today
agreed on a breakthrough land-for-peace deal, but a last-minute
snag threatened to unravel the accord.
</P>
<P>
"We're working hard to work through the issues to put the
agreement back together," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Though Lockhart wouldn't discuss the snag, a senior Israeli
official said the dispute centered on the release of Jonathan
Pollard, an American serving a life sentence for spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton are having intense discussions with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Clinton rejected a clemency plea from Pollard based on
"the enormity of Mr. Pollard's offenses, his lack of remorse, the
damage done to our national security, the need for general
deterrence and the continuing threat to national security that he
posed."
</P>
<P>
Pollard, a Naval intelligence analyst, was arrested outside the
Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985 and sentenced to life in
prison in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Pollard pleaded guilty to espionage charges for selling top-
secret military intelligence that included satellite photos, data
on Soviet weaponry and ship movements.
</P>
<P>
"The breadth and volume of the U.S. classified information sold
by defendant to Israel was enormous, as great as in any reported
case involving espionage on behalf of any foreign nation," federal
prosecutors said in a recent presentencing report.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the West Bank agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians,
reached after nine days of marathon negotiations, was on hold
while the Israelis considered their next move.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official said the U.S. had reached an understanding
with Israeli negotiators for Pollard's release. However, the U.S.
then changed its mind after meeting opposition from the U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton huddled this morning with his negotiating team in a
hastily arranged meeting, conferring in the same room where the
agreement had been sealed hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
His departure from the conference site was delayed for several
hours and a signing ceremony with Netanyahu and Arafat was put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House announced that the agreement will be
announced by President Bill Clinton and be signed at a ceremony at
the White House at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement has been reached between the two parties. The
president will announce that agreement upon his return to the
White House this morning. He expects all parties to join the
President at the White House later today," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after 21 hour face-to-face talks
between Netanyahu and Arafat with presence of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The president spent about 78 hours over seven days at the
secluded Conference Center to press both sides to make "the
hardest decisions." Jordanian King Hussein traveled twice to the
conference site to help.
</P>
<P>
Among the critical issues resolved in the early hours of Friday
were the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the
convocation of the Palestine National Council to revoke its
anti-Israeli charter provisions and a package of security
measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will
convene the Palestine National Council to revocate anti-Israeli
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Israel will release 750 Palestinian prisoners in three phases,
allow the opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza, safe passage
for Palestinians from Gaza to the West Bank, an industrial zone in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel also committed to a third withdrawal from the West Bank,
but the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
A Israeli negotiator told reporters that "unprecedented
achievement has been reached relating to fulfilment of Palestinian
responsibilities" and talks on "final status" issues including
refugees, borders, the status of Jerusalem will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough deal is designed to bring closure to all
interim issues and allow final-status talks to begin.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive issues to be worked out in final talks include
the status of Jerusalem and the borders for a possible Palestinian
state. Those talks are scheduled to end on May 4, 1999, when the
Oslo accords expire.

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Crashes out, All-Australian Final Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- As top-seeded Indian Leander
Paes crashed out of the title race on Friday, there came the
possibility of Australians taking both the men's singles final
berths at the on-going CMG Asia Hong Kong Open challenger tennis
tournament here.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Michael Tebbutt of Australia was one point away
from losing a close second round match and catching the next
flight out of the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap
Kok on Thursday. But he won the match and came back to Victoria
Park's center court on Friday to face top see Paes.
</P>
<P>
With no cliffhanger coming out however, Tebbutt this time did
not let his second chance slip by as he crushed aside the Indian
number one 6-3, 6-3 in 68 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tebbutt was joined in the semi-finals on Saturday by his
eighth-seeded compatriot Lleyton Hewitt, who downed Germany's
Karsten Braasch 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Lleyton Hewitt is to play in the semi-finals non-seeded and
diminutive American Cecil Mamiit, who ousted sixth seed Dennis van
Scheppingen from the Netherlands 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
And Tebbutt's semi-final opponent at the weekend will be
third-seeded Canadian left-hander Daniel Nestor, who defeated
fifth-seed American Justin Gimelstob 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5) to enter
the last four.

WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Friday the approval of two loans and a credit totaling some 100
million U.S. dollars for projects in Venezuela, Guyana and
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
First loan of 60.7 million dollars is earmarked for the Caracas
Slum-Upgrading project in Venezuela. The project will finance the
provision of basic urban services and infrastructure in two
groupings of marginal settlements in Caracas-Petare Norte in the
municipality of Sucre and La Vega in the municipality of
Libertador. Civil works include water, sanitation, access,
drainage, community centers, public lighting, electricity and

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the
Afghan Taliban militia signed an agreement here Friday that has
made the later responsible for the security of U.N. personnel in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The 11-point agreement was inked by the Taliban's
representative Qari Deen Mohammad and Acting U.N. Coordinator for
Afghanistan Ahmed Saeed Farah.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Taliban will appoint a liaison officer
to implement the protocol and a small U.N. group will go to
Afghanistan to assess the situation after the agreement is
implemented.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate possibility of the return of U.N. staff
to the war-torn country, Farah said, adding it depends on the
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban are bound to provide protection to the
U.N. premises under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It also guaranteed that if any U.N. staff member is detained
they should be released within 72 hours in the absence of formal
charges against them. And U.N. staff would be allowed if they want
to visit any of its detained staff to provide them medical
treatment and legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. pulled some 50 foreign workers out of Afghanistan on
August 21 after the killing of an Italian U.N. worker, Carmine
Calo, in an angry demonstration against the U.S. cruise missile
attack on Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident.
</P>
<P>
In addition the Taliban would give a detailed report about the
killing of three U.N. staff members in Taliban controlled areas
this year.

Two other U.N. member staff, Muhammad Hashim Bahsayar of the
World Food Program and Mohammad Naseer Habibi of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, were found dead near the eastern city

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Military Exercise Under way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The annual military exercise
of Cyprus's National Guard is busy under way in conjunction with
the Greek "Toxotis" manoeuvres, though being bothered by Turkish
reconnaissance flights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after watching Friday's exercise in the
eastern town of Larnaca, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Friday described as excellent the on-gonging military drills.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said "we are looking at a modern National guard, very
well equipped, very well trained and ready to defend the Cyprus
Republic."
</P>
<P>
The military exercise code-named "Nikiforos", which started
Tuesday, is participated by some 10,000 troops and reservists. The
Greek Air and Navy Forces, including five warships - a submarine,
a frigate, a destroyer and two torpedo launchers - are also
taking part in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Turkish warplanes' violations of the Cyprus
airspace during the exercise, Clerides said "what I have to say is
that they might be provoking us, but the fact that we are behaving
with excellent calm, is the best answer."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense announced Thursday that two Turkish RF4
reconnaissance planes violated Cyprus air space, while on Tuesday
a Greek transport plane C-130 was buzzed by Turkish F-16s, as it
was heading toward the Paphos air base in the western part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
As part of the exercise, two Greek F-16s and two A-7 Corsair
bombers attacked mock targets in the Nicosia area on Thursday
while on Friday Greek Air Forces and Navy units carried out a
joint search and rescue drill at sea with Cyprus National Guard's
air and naval rescue units as well as police.
</P>
<P>
"Nikiforos '98", which will end on Sunday, was conducted with
the participation of Greek Armed Forces within the framework of a
joint defense pact between Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The pact, signed in November 1993, provides that Greece will
come in aid for Cyprus in case the government-controlled southern
part of the island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since then maintained 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus to protect the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally
in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"
recognized only Ankara.

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade
(ARBIFT) has received positive signals from the U.S. Treasury that
it was ready to discuss ARBIFT's frozen assets in U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
The assests amounted to some 74.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gulf financial sources were quoted as saying this was the
result of efforts by Gulf officials participating in the latest
round of talks held in September between the Gulf Cooperation
Council and the U.S..
</P>

<HEADLINE> Violences Paralyze Oil Town in S. Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between two
ethnic groups has paralyzed the oil town of Warri in south
Nigeria's Delta State, leading to torched houses and unknown
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Friday said the trouble started in the early
morning of Thursday when a village of the Itsekri ethnic group
called Orugbo near Warri was torched by opponent Ijaw youths.
</P>
<P>
About 100 workers of the Shell oil company, Texaco and
Westminster Dredging traveling in four staff buses were taken
hostage in the early morning at Ekurode, an Itsekiri area in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The workers were later released, but without their buses.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday noon, the trouble had spread to the downtown area,
with some major houses set on fire.
</P>
<P>
Youths of the two clashing groups reportedly occupied two
separate buildings of the port authority and exchanged gun fires.
</P>
<P>
The violences set the whole city into panic, with people
fleeing from markets and all shops and offices closed.
</P>
<P>
The government later drafted soldiers to the troubled spots to
maintain order. Several streets were reportedly closed to
traffic and the soldiers kept shooting into the sky.
</P>
<P>
By early evening, the situation had calmed down, as residents
began to move freely, but most of the shops remained closed,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Election to Be Completed in Swaziland Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland electoral
office confirmed Friday that the general election, which was
adjourned last Friday due to heavy rains, will go ahead Saturday,
rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Robert Thwala said in Swazi capital
Mbabane that facilities were in place at the polling stations,
and roads and bridges damaged during last Friday's storm had been
repaired to enable voters to cast their votes, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Thwala as saying that he was optimistic that most
of the 200,000 registered voters would have cast their votes by
the time polling stations closed at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The votes that were cast last weekend are still valid, and the
ballot boxes, held in police stations for safe keeping, will be
returned to the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Thwala said he expected no trouble from anti-government
political groups which had been campaigning for a boycott of the
election.
</P>
<P>
The groups are demanding the election be abandoned until the
ban on political parties is lifted.
</P>
<P>
Political parties are banned in the tiny, landlocked kingdom
and King Mswati III is an absolute monarch in the country who
decides on selection of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 candidates, all nominated by the king, are standing
as individuals for 55 seats in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Armed security forces are expected to be present outside the
polling stations Saturday to ensure a smooth voting process.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, police clashed with the opposition groups whom
police said were "intimidating and harassing" voters.

<HEADLINE> Africa Joins Efforts in Tackling Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- African countries decided
Friday to enhance joint efforts and inter-governmental
cooperation to tackle climate change.
</P>
<P>
A resolution to this effect was agreed upon here by
environmental ministers and experts who ended a two-day meeting
in the Kenyan capital Friday.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that there is need to intergrate the
international environmental agreements into the governmental
activities, putting priority to a mechanism mainly focusing on
ozone emission and involved in almost all African states.
</P>
<P>
The African Ministerial Conference on Environment (AMCEN) was
attended by at least 15 African environmental ministers and
dozens of delegates across the continent at the headquarters of
the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) here.
</P>
<P>
Africa is projected to warm more than most regions of the
world, and many parts of Africa might experience a decrease in
precipitation, Robert Watson, chief of the Inter-Governmental
Panel on Climate Change, told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The changes in climate are expected to result in the arid and
semi-arid areas of Africa becoming even drier, a decrease in
agricultural productivity, and an increase in the incidence of
vector-borne diseases, particularly malaria and dengue fever, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It will also cause the disruption of natural ecological
systems and the displacement of peoples living in low-lying
coastal regions, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Watson urged the African states to work out strategies that
could make them less vulnerable to both natural climate
variability and long-term human-induced climate changes in
agriculture, forestry, water, health, natural resource management
and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The continent also faces challenges to identify energy supply
and energy demand projects that are eligible for the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) -- a key role in their attempts to
gain sustainable development goals, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CDM, highlighted by the ministers at this meeting, aims to
help African states win socio-economic development through
technical and financial transfers and assistance without
endangering the climate and the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The CDM may provide ample opportunities for early and
substantial (ozone) emission reductions which can involve all
parties, irrespective of their regional or economic affiliations,
in collaborative, cost-effective emission reduction and climate
control," said UNEP chief Klaus Toepfer at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Minister of Environment, Science and Technology J.E.
Afful stressed that the CDM "should provide enough flexibility to
ensure that the different objectives of the developed and
developing world to meet."
</P>
<P>
"For Africa, the mechanism must be appropriately designed and
implemented with the support of all major stake-holders in order
to facilitate the continent's quest for sustainable development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A series of inter-governmental meetings over the ozone layer,
desertification and climate change will be held by African
countries later this year.

<HEADLINE> DRC Refugees in Tanzania Rise to 12,765 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The refugees fleeing
from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo into neighboring
Tanzania have risen to 12,765, Ministry of Home Affairs officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry's office in the Kigoma Region in
west Tanzania, told Xinhua over telephone that recently most of
the refugees have come from Uvira, Kalemie and Baraka in the
eastern part of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Congo (K) took up arms against President Laurent
Kabila on August 2 and have seized large areas in the east. Since
then, people in the country have attempted to cross Lake
Tanganyika by boat into Tanzania to escape war flames.
</P>
<P>
The incoming refugees are accommodated at the Nyarugusu camp,
some 160 kilometers northwest of the Kigoma Town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official, who declined to be identified, said
3,198 Burundi refugees have also arrived in the region since
August 6.

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Guo Zhengxin stamped his
strength in the men's short program but failed to give a strong
inspiration to the host team when the foreign skaters take the
lead in other events at the world junior figure skating grand
prix on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guo, who finished eighth in the Nagano Winter Olympics this
year, lived up to the expectation of the local fans when he
fabulously finished all eight compulsory actions and collected
the highest scores for both technic and artistry.
</P>
<P>
Guo was marked two 5.4s and two 5.3s for required elements
with three 5.3s for his presentation, the first time for him to
be so balanced in the two categories.
</P>
<P>
Guo's compatriot Wang Yu came in second with Johan Sand'Homme
of France third.
</P>
<P>
The lead of women's short programs was claimed by Yoshie Onda
of Japan, followed by Gwenaelle Jullien of France. Wang Huan,
who won the event at China's national skating championship,
picked up a third place.
</P>
<P>
The skating powerhouse Russia showed their talent fully when
their duos swept the first two places with China placed third.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Probe into Mysterious Death of People in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Interpol is joining an
probe into the death of 18 Zimbabweans who seemed have suffocated
on the back of a truck en route form Bulawaya, Zimbabwe to South
Africa, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The police is searching for the driver of a truck who
apparently dumped the bodies of 18 people in the bush near the
capital Gaborone, Botswana Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Interpol was facilitating investigations by the Botswana,
South African and Zimbabwean police, assistant superintendent
Chris Mbulawe was quoted as saying in Gaborone Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two people reportedly survived the horrific incident and
regained consciousness among the bodies dumped near the village
of Tlokweng, 20 km from the Botswana-South Africa border.
</P>
<P>
The victims were 17 men and a woman, thought to be Zimbabweans
who were believed to plan to enter South Africa illegally through
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Mbulawe said Botswanan police, shocked by the incident, as yet
had no lead to the identity or whereabouts of the driver and his
truck.
</P>
<P>
"Botswanann police have never before had so many dead people in
one case," SAPA quoted Mbulawe as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mbulawe said the survivors, who were still too shocked to
speak coherently, did not know what happened along the way.
</P>
<P>
According to Botswanan chief immigration officer Peter Seile,
Botswana, bordering with South Africa and Zimbabwe, repatriates
more than 1,000 illegal immigrants every month.
</P>
<P>
It is suspected that many illegals use Botswana as a conduit
to enter South Africa. By far, the majority of illegal immigrants
detected are from Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Monitors in Kosovo in Few Days, Says Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Yugoslavia, October 23 (Xinhua) -- William Walker,
the head of the OSCE Verification Mission in Kosovo, said here on
Friday the mission force will start their jobs in Kosovo in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after ending his one-day introductory
visit to Pristina, Walker said the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was getting the members of the
verification mission to Kosovo as fast as it could.
</P>
<P>
To bring in the total number of 2,000-strong force was a
stepped process, but the mood in Vienna, the mood around Europe,
in the United States and Canada "is to get as many people in here
as fast as possible who are capable of doing the job," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very fast by international community
standards," said Walker, the American ambassador who was appointed
to head the mission five days ago by the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of 2,000 OSCE observers was in accordance with
an agreement reached 10 days ago between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. The mission
will monitor the situation and verify the compliance of UN demands
including the withdrawal of Serb forces and safe return of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Walker also said the OSCE was determined to make the
verification task a success.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite confident. We think we can help get conditions
better. We are going to do everything we possibly can to have
Kosovo return to being a stable, peaceful community living under
the process of a true democracy."
</P>
<P>
When asked how he can make the mission successful with unarmed
verifiers in the conflicting area, Walker said there are two ways
international community is going to be determining what's
situation here, one is the ground verification and the other
overhead observation-- the NATO air surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"we are going to know very accurately what's happening on the
ground in Kosovo from these two observation monitoring systems,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff Agreed to Return to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
the Afghan Taliban faction signed an agreement on Friday in
Islamabad, Pakistan, paving the way for the return of U.N.
international staff to Afghanistan, a U.N. spokesperson announced
here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed after five days of talks between the two
sides, contains 11 points on the security for U.N. staff in
Afghanistan, from where the United Nations withdrew its
international personnel after their safety and security came under
threat and Washington's August missile attacks on alleged
terrorist bases in the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement commits the Taliban to provide "satisfactory
reports to the U.N." on investigations into the murders of three
U.N. staff members in July and August, and obliges the Afghan
armed faction to release U.N. national staff currently held in
detention, said the spokesperson, who, however, failed to give an
exact number of the Taliban-held detainees working for the world
body in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Once these points have been implemented, a small U.N. team
plans to go into Afghanistan to assess the security situation on
the ground, the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
A small number of U.N. international staff will begin to return
to Afghanistan after receiving favorable security reports.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Peace Agreement Differ in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators were close to sign an interim peace agreement,
mixed reactions were stirred up in the political spectrum of
Israel on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The response of the right-wing was mainly negative.
</P>
<P>
Zvi Handel, Knesset (parliament) member of ruling National
Religious Party, said that his party will vote against the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Raharam Zeevi, Knesset member of far-right Moledet party said
that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handing territories to
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Moledet will do all it could to overturn
Netanyahu's government.
</P>
<P>
Two ministers of Netanyahu's government, Limor Livnat and
Silvan Shalom, praised the U.S. for obtaining important
commitments from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But they reserved their final judgment until the full details
of the agreement are available.
</P>
<P>
Livnat and Shalom have warned Netanyahu that he would have
a hard time pushing any deal he may bring back with him through
the cabinet, if that deal fails to meet the security demands of
the Jewish country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank said on Friday that if Netanyahu signs the agreement, he
will betray those who elected him to office.
</P>
<P>
It added that the new situation will have a very negative
effect on the relations between settlers and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some politicians from the government and
the opposition Labor Party expressed support to the signing of
the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Pins Hope on U.N. for National Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will continue to pin its
hope on the U.N. for a just, viable and lasting solution to the
Cyprus problem, President Glafcos Clerides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks in a message to the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the occasion of the 53rd
anniversary of the founding of the international organization.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to look forward to a peaceful reunification of
our island, achieved through negotiations within the framework of
your mission of good offices, on the basis of U.N. resolutions on
Cyprus and the two High Level Agreement of 1977 and 1979,"
Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island
through a bi-communal formula, but the peace talks has been
deadlock since last year after the Turkish Cypriots opted out of
the negotiations to protest a European Union decision to begin
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash raised a proposal in
August, calling for the establishment of a confederation of two
equal states on the island, which met strong objections from the
Greek Cypriot-dominated Cypriot government and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Referring to the challenges being faced by the U.N., Clerides
said "it is incumbent on all the peoples of the U.N. to work
together to face successfully these dangers" to protect and
maintain world peace and security, achieve universal respect for
and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms both at a
regional and international level.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Agreement Reached, But Then Snagged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today
agreed on a breakthrough land-for-peace deal, but a last-minute
snag threatened to unravel the accord.
</P>
<P>
"We're working hard to work through the issues to put the
agreement back together," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Though Lockhart wouldn't discuss the snag, a senior Israeli
official said the dispute centered on the release of Jonathan
Pollard, an American serving a life sentence for spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton are having intense discussions with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Clinton rejected a clemency plea from Pollard based on
"the enormity of Mr. Pollard's offenses, his lack of remorse, the
damage done to our national security, the need for general
deterrence and the continuing threat to national security that he
posed."
</P>
<P>
Pollard, a Naval intelligence analyst, was arrested outside the
Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985 and sentenced to life in
prison in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Pollard pleaded guilty to espionage charges for selling top-
secret military intelligence that included satellite photos, data
on Soviet weaponry and ship movements.
</P>
<P>
"The breadth and volume of the U.S. classified information sold
by defendant to Israel was enormous, as great as in any reported
case involving espionage on behalf of any foreign nation," federal
prosecutors said in a recent presentencing report.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the West Bank agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians,
reached after nine days of marathon negotiations, was on hold
while the Israelis considered their next move.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official said the U.S. had reached an understanding
with Israeli negotiators for Pollard's release. However, the U.S.
then changed its mind after meeting opposition from the U.S.
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton huddled this morning with his negotiating team in a
hastily arranged meeting, conferring in the same room where the
agreement had been sealed hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
His departure from the conference site was delayed for several
hours and a signing ceremony with Netanyahu and Arafat was put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House announced that the agreement will be
announced by President Bill Clinton and be signed at a ceremony at
the White House at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement has been reached between the two parties. The
president will announce that agreement upon his return to the
White House this morning. He expects all parties to join the
President at the White House later today," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after 21 hour face-to-face talks
between Netanyahu and Arafat with presence of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The president spent about 78 hours over seven days at the
secluded Conference Center to press both sides to make "the
hardest decisions." Jordanian King Hussein traveled twice to the
conference site to help.
</P>
<P>
Among the critical issues resolved in the early hours of Friday
were the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the
convocation of the Palestine National Council to revoke its
anti-Israeli charter provisions and a package of security
measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will
convene the Palestine National Council to revocate anti-Israeli
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Israel will release 750 Palestinian prisoners in three phases,
allow the opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza, safe passage
for Palestinians from Gaza to the West Bank, an industrial zone in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel also committed to a third withdrawal from the West Bank,
but the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
A Israeli negotiator told reporters that "unprecedented
achievement has been reached relating to fulfilment of Palestinian
responsibilities" and talks on "final status" issues including
refugees, borders, the status of Jerusalem will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough deal is designed to bring closure to all
interim issues and allow final-status talks to begin.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive issues to be worked out in final talks include
the status of Jerusalem and the borders for a possible Palestinian
state. Those talks are scheduled to end on May 4, 1999, when the
Oslo accords expire.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: China Opposes Use of Force Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said here on Friday that China has "difficulties in
principle" with a draft resolution over Kosovo before the U.N.
Security Council, and called upon the international community to
"fully recognize" the great efforts and concessions already made
by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement to the press here after the U.N.
Security Council adjourned its closed-door consultations on
Serbia's Kosovo Province.
</P>
<P>
"China has no difficulties with a technical resolution by the
Council to endorse the agreement" between U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, he
said, "But in so far as this draft is concerned, we have
difficulties in principle."
</P>
<P>
"The authorities of the FRY (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)
have made great efforts and concessions for the peaceful
resolution of the question of Kosovo. This should be fully
recognized by the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, a regional organization concerned unilaterally
decided, without seeking authorization from the Council, to take
military actions against the FRY, and grossly interfere in the
internal affairs of a sovereign state," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"This does not fit in the positive atmosphere surrounding the
question of Kosovo, nor does it conform to the purposes,
principles, relevant requirements of the U.N. Charter, or norms
of international law, " he said, "Furthermore, this is not in
line with the said organization's own Charter."
</P>
<P>
"Now some members would like to have the Council endorse the
above-mentioned irresponsible action, which China could by no
means get along with," he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- NBA players played a
friendly game Friday to raise money for charity in Houston, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler and Kenny Smith coached pro players in two
teams. The game was played on the University of Houston's home
court, where Drexler will begin his coaching career this season
after retiring from the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
"These guys are well trained and they are trying to show
solidarity on the part of the NBA players," Drexler said. "They
want to show the fans and let the public know that they're
willing to play but they are locked out and there is nothing they
can do."
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 spectators watched the first game played by NBA
players since the lockout.
</P>
<P>
Penny Hardway, Tim Hardaway and Nick Exel played in the game.
David Robinson attended the game, but did not play.
</P>
<P>
"We just hope the fans will stick in there with us and
eventually, we'll will back," said Damon Stoudamire of Portland.
</P>

Prices for the charity game were still of NBA caliber. Tickets
ranged from 20 to 100 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Gymnast Sues Her Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic gymnastic
winner Dominique Moceanu said it was the toughest thing in her
life to sue her parents and claimed it was her own decision.
</P>
<P>
"Let me make it perfectly clear, no one is pushing or
pressuring me into this decision," the 17-year-old said in a
statement read by her lawyer Roy W. Moore.
</P>
<P>
"It's something I have thought about for a long time and
recent decisions by my father made it clear to me that it had to
be done immediately."
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Olympic gold medalist fled her parent's home late
Sunday and on Monday filed a lawsuit demanding to be declared a
legal adult so she could get answers about how her earnings are
being spent, primarily by her father, Dumitru Moceanu.
</P>
<P>
"I want whatever I have earned to be under my control so I
know how my earnings are being used and I want to be able to
train and compete in the sport I love for the right reason,
because I love it, not because my father tells me I have to make
more money," Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
Moceanu is aiming to compete in the 2000 Olympics. She asked a
Texas district court to declare her an adult so she can handle
her own affairs.
</P>
<P>
She charged her father controlled and pressured her and
mismanaged her financial affairs, including about 1 million U.S.
dollars in earnings. The court has issued a restraining order
against her parents.
</P>
<P>
Dumitru refuted his daughter's charges that she was denied a
childhood, and he continued to stress that he hopes for a
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a kid who asked on her 17th birthday to trade in her
Mercedes for a new Mustang," said Richard Flores, legal assistant
for Dumitru's lawyer, Katherine Scardino.
</P>
<P>
A hearing is set for November 11.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay, Argentina Inaugurate First Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President Julio
Maria Sanguinetti Friday inaugurated the first
Argentina-to-Uruguay natural gas pipeline in a ceremony held at a
cement plant of the Ancap oil company in Paysandu.
</P>
<P>
The 20-kilometer gas duct starts near the city of Colon in the
Argentine province of Entre Rios, and leads to Paysandu, crossing
the Uruguay River under the Colon-Paysandu International Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The 10 million U.S. dollar works can move 300,000 cubic meters
of gas daily.
</P>
<P>
Now the pipeline provides gas mainly for the cement plant, but
in future it will send gas for civil use in the northern provinces
of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The new pipeline is one of the three gas lines Uruguay and
Argentina planned to build.
</P>
<P>
The other two lines are the Buenos Aires-to-Montevideo line
which is to be built early next year, and the Entre
Rios-to-Casablanca line, planned by the Ancap company and another
Uruguay state-owned electricity firm, which will begin in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Buenos Aires-to-Montevideo gas line,
about 210 kilometers long, will cost 130 million dollars and has a
capacity of delivering 5 million cubic meters of gas every day.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the third pipeline is for a future
thermoelectric center in Casablanca, some 16 kilometers south of
Paysandu.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan authorities said the three gas lines will supply half
a million Uruguayan residents with clean fuel, and boost greatly
the industries and agriculture in the southwest developed area in
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline between Argentina and Uruguay is part of the
energy cooperation among Mercosur (South American Common Market)
member countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay. Experts predicted that in the near future there will be
a natural gas pipeline network among Mercosur members.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session of the Third Ministerial
Conference of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in

Zedillo added that his government has supported through diverse
mechanisms the efforts of the Science and Technology Council to

</P>
<P>
The Mexican president told the ministers he is confident that
the APEC ministerial meeting will contribute to efforts in
realizing the goals of countries in the region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coroner: Seizure, Suffocation Kill Griffith Joyner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Fornece Griffith Joyner,
the fastest female sprinter in history, had a cavernous angioma
in her brain and that brought an epileptic seizure which caused
her suffocation to death, according to a coroner today.
</P>
<P>
"In layman's terms, she suffocated to death," said Richard
Fukumoto, chief of forensics for the Orange County
sheriff-coroner department in California.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy found no indication of drug use in the death of the
38-year-old, three-time Olympic gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
Fukumoto said Griffith Joyner apparently had been lying on her
stomach and the seizure possibly caused her limbs to stiffen and
turn her head to the right, where her breathing was constricted
by covers and pillows.
</P>
<P>
The seizure involved a congenital blood vessel abnormality,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Zaias, an investigator with the coroner's office, said
Griffith Joyner had a "cavernous angioma" on the front left part
of her brain, a condition found in about 0.25 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Some people with this condition live their lives without
knowing they have it, while others have headaches and seizures,
Zaias told the press.
</P>
<P>
The medical experts told reporters that the abnormality has
never been associated with banned or illegal substances.
</P>
<P>
Toxicology tests showed that Griffith Joyner had taken one
tablet each of the painkiller Tylenol and antihistamine Benadryl,
but "there was nothing unusual in terms of drugs," said Frank
Fitzpatrick, head of forensic sciences for the Orange County sh
eriff's office.
</P>
<P>
Investigators had been trying to determine the cause of
Griffith Joyner's death since September 21, when she was found
"unresponsive" and "not breathing" in bed by her husband, Al
Joyner.
</P>
<P>
The Joyner family issued a statement through its California
attorney, Paul S. Meyer, in response to the autopsy findings.
</P>
<P>
"We thank the coroner's office for doing a thorough job and
allowing us to bring closure to our tragic loss," the statement
read. "The results of the investigation confirm the fact that
Florence Griffith Joyner passed away from a congenital vascular
malformation in her brain.
</P>
<P>
"There were no heart problems and there was no indication of
any drug or steroid use, past and present," the statement
continued. "Her remarkable achievement remain unspoiled. The
family appreciates the tremendous outpouring of support and
compassion. We, and all the world, will carry in our hearts a
loving memory of this extraordinary woman."
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner won the 100 and 200 meters Olympic gold medals
in world record times at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and added
4x100m relay gold to her credit.

<HEADLINE> India Government Amends Investment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- In a major change in foreign
direct investment policy, the Indian government is making it
mandatory for foreign companies in technical collaboration with
Indian companies to take no-objection certificates from their
Indian partners in case they want to set up their own subsidiaries
or joint ventures in India, official sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The certificates will be required only if the foreign companies
are planning to manufacture the same category of products for
which they have provided technology to the Indian firms.
</P>
<P>
Till now, the clearance was mandatory for foreign collaborators
seeking to either increase their stake in joint ventures or set up
wholly-owned subsidiaries in the same sector in which the joint
ventures were operating.
</P>
<P>
The new move proposed by the Industry Ministry is aimed at
protecting domestic companies from the threat of an abrupt end to
technology transfer from their overseas technology donors which do
not have any financial stakes in the companies.
</P>
<P>
"Indian companies enter into technology tie-ups with foreign
companies with long-term plans and, therefore, need some kind of
protection to ensure that the technology flow is not cut off
midstream," a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic companies have been complaining about the armtwisting
tactics used by foreign technology collaborators to obtain
financial stakes in Indian companies, through the use of the
technology trump card, he said.

<HEADLINE> Border Trade Improves Locals' Life in Fangcheng Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Border trade in Fangcheng port
city of the south China's Guangxi autonomous region has made life
better for local people in this city of south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region
</P>
<P>
Thousands of households in Fangcheng, which has a borderline of
200 kilometers with Viet Nam, have become well-to-do thanks to
border trade, according to Xu Wenyan, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Fangcheng City People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Wutou Village was turned the most affluent villages inhabited
by ethnic minority people in country in 1997. Then, border trade with
viet Nam created an average annual per capita income of 7,000 yuan
(845 US dollars) for this village of 1,502 people, mostly of the
ethnic Jing group.
</P>
<P>
Border trade tariffs and fees now contribute to approximately
65 percent of the annual income of Dongxing City (under the
jurisdiction of Fangcheng city), according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
The State Council listed Dongxing, which has a land borderline
of 27.8 km with Viet Nam, as an open border city in 1992. At
present, firms from 15 Chinese provinces and from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, Macao and Singapore are doing
business in Dongxing now. As many as 10,000 people from the east
China province of Zhejiang have come here in pursuit of better
livelihoods, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996-97, some 1.13 billion yuan of border trade and 700
million yuan (84.5 million US dollars) in tax revenues were
produced in Fangcheng, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Border trade with Viet Nam, which was fully resumed in Guangxi
back in 1989, has developed rapidly since the normalization of
Sino-Vietnamese relations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Three practices -- barter transactions between border residents
of the two countries, trade involving small volumes and economic
and technological cooperation in border areas -- are defined as
border trade in China.
</P>
<P>
Border trade enjoys tariff-free or low tariff rates.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Crisis Moves Toward Political Solution, Says Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Christopher Hill, a U.S. special
envoy on Kosovo, said here Friday that progress has already been
made toward a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis, but much
remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
Hill made the remark at a joint press conference with Albanian
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko after separate talks with Albanian
President Rexhep Meidani and Majko.
</P>
<P>
Hill, also the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, told reporters
that 1,500 observers have been deployed in Kosovo and a new
delegation of observers will arrive in the troubled province
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, such political processes as
negotiations between Belgrade and the provincial capital Pristina
are still going on. All these showed that progress has already
been secured toward a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who has been striving to broker negotiations between
Belgrade and Pristina, said difficulties still remain in the
regard.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacle to the negotiations, according to him, lies
in the fact that the conflicting sides are far apart in their
opinions on the "pattern for the ultimate solution to the Kosovo
crisis", i.e., the final political status for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Hill said a group of legal workers are working with him in
Pristina on the solution of the Kosovo status. However, he could
not tell for the moment when the work would be completed.
</P>
<P>
Majko said no one but the political force of the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo could decide their own fate.
</P>
<P>
Hill noted earlier during talks with Meidani that it still
takes time to normalize life in Kosovo and attain an acceptable
and permanent solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meidani hoped that the ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo will
objectively evaluate the support from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and other international organizations, and reach a
consensus to facilitate the settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hill also met the Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo during
his one-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Garment Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's garment exports for
the first seven months of this year rose 64.51 percent to 79.84
billion baht (1.94 billion U.S. dollars) compared with the same
period last year, according to the Thai Garment Manufacturers
Association.
</P>
<P>
The Nation Saturday quoted the association as saying that
exports to three major markets, the United States, the European
Union and Japan, were 63.5 billion baht (1.54 billion dollars),
accounting for 79.54 percent of the total export value.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the U.S. stood at more than 39 billion baht (951
million dollars) in the first seven months of this year, a rise of
98.18 percent, with exports to the EU rising 67.62 percent to
17.41 billion baht (424 million dollars), and exports to Japan
surging 21.71 percent to 7.08 billion baht (172 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
But, Suchart Chantaranakaracha, managing director of Gold Mine
Garment Co. Ltd., said that exporters will face severe export
problems by the end of this year due to baht instability. The
rapid strengthening of the baht against the U.S. dollar is hurting
the competitiveness of Thailand's export sector.
</P>
<P>
The baht was trading now between 37.5 to 38 baht against the
dollar compared to up to 56 baht in January.
</P>
<P>
Suchart said the immediate effect on the apparel export
industry will be a decline in the number of orders because
importers will have more bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
Suchart said that the authorities should maintain the exchange
rate at 42-43 baht for a further year. This rate would help
exporters to stimulate buyers to place more orders but buyers may
stall if the currency hovers around 38 baht.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Sequence Chlamydia Trachomatis Genome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- American scientists have
completed sequencing the Chlamydia trachomatis genome, thus
providing new insights into chlamydial infection, the most
prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Science journal, the scientists are
from the University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco,
and Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this accomplishment has important
implications for vaccine development. The genome sequence has
revealed surface proteins about which scientists knew nothing, and
the organism's unique biochemical pathways provide promising new
leads for developing antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists have found that unlike most bacteria, this
organism only grows inside the host cell, just like a virus.
</P>
<P>
Also many aspects of C. trachomatis--its physiology, structure,
developmental biology and genetics--are poorly understood. Its
genome however has already revealed some extraordinary secrets.
</P>
<P>
Over time, it appears that this bacterium has borrowed genetic
information from its human hosts, and it uses this information to
tap the resources of the cells and get essential nutrients that it
cannot make.
</P>
<P>
More than 4 million new cases of chlamydial infection occur in
the United States each year, and associated medical costs are
estimated to exceed 2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Poland Urges Belgrade to Implement U.N. Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Ministry issued a
statement Friday, urging Belgrade to implement the United Nations
Security Council resolution on Kosovo immediately and in a
comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, read out by a ministry spokesman, Poland
expressed its concerns over what it described as the "very slow"
withdrawal of Yugoslav troops and special police forces deployed
in Kosovo in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The presence of these troops was hindering the return of
refugees to their permanent residence, and increasing, in the
meantime, the difficulties for the delivery of humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The statement therefore called on the Yugoslav authorities to
implement immediately and in a comprehensive manner the U.N.
Security Council resolution No. 1199, which was adopted on
September 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said the implementation of the resolution
is the only way for a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.

PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- American world number one Pete
Sampras pulled out of his match against German Tommy Haas because
of a back injury on Friday in the Lyon tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, world third-ranked Patrick Rafter of Australia with
a muscle strain was eliminated by unseeded South African Wayne
Ferreira 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Both seeds' injuries boosted the chances of Chilean Marcelo
Rios taking over the world number one spot by the end of the
years.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, whose back injury had troubled him since his
three-set match against compatriot Todd Martin on Wednesday, left
for Stuttgart on Friday where he plans to rest for three days
before entering the German event.
</P>
<P>
He is leading the ATP ranking with a comfortable advantage
over Rios and Rafter but he also has more points to defend than
them.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed because I like this tournament," the
American, a three-time winner in Lyon between 1991 and 1993, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the U.S. Open winner, refused to blame injury for his
defeat but he twice needed medical attention during the second
set.

Rios meanwhile easily dispatched unseeded Frenchman Arnaud Di
Pasquale 6-4, 6-0.  The Chilean will face Haas in the next round.

<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China is to seek more
preferential loans and investment from overseas and raise domestic
funding to expand the transport infrastructure, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 17.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign loans and
funding made available since 1979 have provided much-needed
support to make up for the lack of domestic funds for China's
ambitious plan to expand road and water transportation routes,
according to Sun Guoqing, deputy director of the Ministry of
Communications' Comprehensive Planning Department.
</P>
<P>
Sun was speaking at a Symposium on Opportunities and Challenges
for the Development of the Transport Industry organized by the
ministry as part of the five-day China Transpo '98, which opened
on Thursday at the Beijing Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
China intends to invest 500 billion yuan (60.5 billion
U.S. dollars) between 1998 and 2000 to extend highway routes from
1.226 million kilometers to 1.3 million kilometers. In addition,
plans to expand navigable inland water-ways and coastal ports will
be implemented at the same time, it said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign capital should play a "greater role" in the transport
sector, Sun said, adding that loans from international financial
institutions and foreign governments have been a major source of
foreign capital for transport infrastructure, accounting for 60
percent of total investment.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador-Peru Peace Accord to Be Signed in Brasilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A peace accord between Peru
and Ecuador will be signed next Monday, ending a border dispute
that had lasted more than 50 years, Brazil's Foreign Minister Luis
Felipe Lampreia announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The accord was brokered by Brazil, the United States, Argentina
and Chile, which stepped in after three years of peace talks
between Peru and Ecuador became deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador agreed to accept whatever proposal the four
mediating countries would present as a final decision.
</P>
<P>
Felipe made the official announcement after the proposal was
delivered to officials in Quito and Lima.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be signed in Brasilia by Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori and Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad in the
presence of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
Argentine President Carlos Menem, Chilean President Eduardo Frei,
and U.S. representatives.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the pact, the portion of border unmarked
until now will be demarcated along the Cordillera de Condor
mountain range as requested by Peru.
</P>
<P>
But a jungle-cloaked hill called Tiwintza lying within the
territory allocated to Peru will be granted to Ecuador as private
property although remaining under Peruvian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The 250-acre (100-hectare) hill area is a highly emotional
symbol to Ecuador, whose troops defended it successfully against
repeated Peruvian assaults during their border war in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for the creation of two contiguous
national parks in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
The border conflict dates to 1941 when Peru and Ecuador fought a
war along the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
Peru won the first territorial war and the two sides signed the
Rio Protocol in 1942 to define 1,762-kilometers of border.
</P>
<P>
But with 78 kilometers of border left undefined, Ecuador
declared the demarcation partially void, which froze the process
of border settlement. Since then, two wars have broken out over
the area, in 1981 and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tensions flared most recently in August when Peru accused 300
Ecuadoran troops of violating its territory. When Ecuador insisted
its troops were not inside Peru, Lima refused to continue
internationally sponsored peace talks aimed at resolving the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori agreed later to let peacekeepers from neutral
countries serve as a buffer on the troubled border.
</P>
<P>
Before this accord to be signed on Monday, Mahuad and Fujimori
also signed treaties with regard to commerce and navigation
between the two countries and an agreement to increase integration
along their frontiers.

<HEADLINE> Prices in Guangdong Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Prices in south China's
Guangdong Province, a showcase of the country's market economy
reforms, bounced back after declines for six consecutive months,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Both the overall price index and the consumer price index for
September was one percentage point higher than in August, the
provincial statistics bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the rising prices mainly to a rebound in
grain and vegetable prices. Guangdong's vegetable prices in
September was 20.7 percent higher than in August, while the grain
price was up 2.1 percent on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of industrial products also rose slightly
last month. Prices of garments, gasoline, and construction and
decoration materials bounced back for the first time this year in
September.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when compared with a year ago, the retail and
consumer price indices in September still was 4.3 percent and 3.2
percent lower, respectively, than in the same month of last
year. The two indicators edged down 2.8 percent and 1.6 percent
year-on-year, respectively, in the first nine months this year.

<HEADLINE> Super-Typhoon Leaves Over 100 Dead in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the
super-typhoon "Babs," one of the strongest to hit the Philippines
so far this year, soared to over 100 with dozens of others missing
after the storm dumped heavy rains and triggered mudslides in
parts of the country, according to press reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star newspaper said that the death toll rose to
107 with 39 others missing after the typhoon wreaked havoc across
wide areas of Eastern Visayas, Bicol and Southern and Central
Luzon, causing landslides and flash floods that sank villages and
swept away houses.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Philippine National Red Cross sources as
saying that an estimated 250,000 people were displaced by the
typhoon "Babs," the ninth storm to hit the country this year.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times newspaper put the number of fatalities at 104.
</P>
<P>
About 80 of the fatalities were villagers caught in mudslides
in Catanduanes and Camarines Sur provinces in Bicol, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high number of deaths already reported, the paper
said, the casualty toll could still rise because there are still
provinces unheard from.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon, which entered the Philippines Wednesday, was
already out into the South China Sea Friday.

WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Despite a deal with Bruce
Arena to coach the U.S. national soccer team is drawing closer,
and could be announced next week, Arena said to expect no
announcement from him after his team finishes playing its rival
in the U.S. Main League Soccer final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about that to be honest," the D.C. United
coach said of a possible confirmation. "If you know anything, you
should be talking to U.S. Soccer."
</P>
<P>
For months now, Arena has remained dedicated to the United
and unrevealing about his status with the U.S. national team, but
U.S. Soccer's stated announcement time is drawing close, and so
is the USA's game against Australia on November 6 in San Jose,
California.
</P>
<P>
United general manager Kevin Payne, who had a casual
interview with Thomas Rognen regarding the United position should
Arena leave, has offered nothing new.

China (CPC) Central Committee Jiang Zemin Friday praised late
Marshal Peng Dehuai as an older generation revolutionary,
statesman and military strategist as well as an outstanding leader
of the Party, the State and the army.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made these remarks at a forum to mark the centennial of
Peng Dehuai's birth, held by the Central Military Commission, of
which Jiang is also the chairman.
</P>
<P>
-- The third meeting of the National Committee of the Ninth
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) closed
yesterday afternoon, with Chairman Li Ruihuan attending.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of "great victory" over the summer floods, the
worst since 1954, and said that the "flood-fighting spirit"
exhibits the excellent moral of the Chinese nation and is of great
and profound importance to encouraging the people.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Today's newspaper published a front-page editorial which
hails the 40th founding anniversary of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern Ningxia autonomous region has experienced
tremendous changes in the past 40 years since it was founded on
October 25, 1958, especially since the country initiated the
reform and opening drive in the late 1970s, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Zhu Rongji yesterday sent regards to his Japanese
counterpart to mark the 20th anniversary of the signing of the

significant growth in bilateral relations in the political,
economic and trade, science and technology, cultural and military
fields in the past few years. This progress has been achieved
through the joint efforts of both sides and frequent visits
between leaders of the two countries.
</P>
<P>

overseas and raise domestic funding to expand the transport
infrastructure, a senior official says.
</P>
<P>
The 17.4 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign loans and
funding made available since 1979 have provided much-needed
support to make up for the lack of domestic funds for China's
ambitious plan to expand road and water transportation routes, Sun
Guoqing, deputy director of the Ministry of Communications'
Comprehensive Planning Department, said in Beijing yesterday at a
symposium on Opportunities and Challenges for the Development of
the Transport Industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Paolo di Canio was banned for
11 matches and fined 10,000 pounds on Friday after pushing
referee Paul Alcock over during Sheffield Wednesday's game
against Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
A Football Association disciplinary panel made the decision
after finding him guilty of misconduct at a hearing at Bramall
Lane, the home of Sheffield United FC.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which includes a three-match suspension for Di
Canio's red card plus another eight matches for the push, means
the Italian will not be able to play again until after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
But the decision has been greeted with dismay by Alcock and
referees' chief Philip Don.
</P>
<P>
Di Canio, 30, arrived at the hearing half an hour early,
accompanied by his lawyer, Sandro Censie, and Wednesday officials
Ian Stott, Alan Burbidge and Frank Pattison.
</P>
<P>
A group of Wednesday supporters waited outside, with one
claiming that Di Canio's "only real crime was showing his passion
for the club".
</P>
<P>
But Di Canio was in contrite mood afterwards, saying: "I want
to say that I'm very, very sorry for what's happened. I had a
fair hearing. I'll see the Sheffield Wednesday fans on Boxing
Day, the first game after my suspension."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday have confirmed that they will not be appealing
against the disciplinary panel's decision.
</P>
<P>
The FA's director of public affairs, David Davies, who was at
the game when the incident occurred, also attended the hearing.
</P>
<P>
"Following the hearing, the commission was unanimous that an
urgent recommendation should go to the FA's disciplinary
committee to ask that it should be made clear to all concerned
that stronger penalties should be imposed immediately on any
player who manhandles a match official," said Davies.
</P>
<P>
He added that Di Canio had "vehemently denied" newspaper
reports which quoted him as accusing Alcock of falling
deliberately.

The Philippine Star:
</P>
<P>
-- The death toll from typhoon "Babs," one of the strongest to
hit the Philippines so far this year, soared to 107 with 39 others
missing after the storm wreaked havoc Friday across Eastern
Visayas, Bicol and Southern and Central Luzon, causing landslides
and flash floods that sank villages and swept away houses.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines' share price closed higher Friday, reversing
a weak start and bucking a regional downtrend, due largely to the

rates, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines has emerged as one of the strongest
economies in Asia, resisting the worst fallout from the Asian

HELSINKI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari said Friday Finland should not criticize China over the
human rights issue or pressure it to change its human rights
policies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a function celebrating the centenary of the Finnish
Bar Association, Ahtisaari said sincere talks and concrete
cooperation with China are more effective ways to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
It will take time for China to reform as it is a big country,
he said, emphasizing China has expressed its willingness to join
the international systems of human rights protection.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two countries have had fruitful
cooperation and shared positive experiences in the judiciary field.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has also shown great interest in Finland's
legislative reform on human rights protection.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcy Cases in New Zealand Surge to 10-year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of bankruptcies
in New Zealand have surged almost 22 percent to a 10-year high.
</P>
<P>
According to figures recently issued by the New Zealand
Insolvency and Trustee Service, there were 918 new bankruptcies in
the third quarter of this year, up from 754 in the previous
corresponding quarter.
</P>
<P>
There have been 2,455 bankruptcies already this year. Andrew
Bridgman, national manager of the Insolvency and Trustee Service,
expects the total number of bankruptcies this year will exceed
last year's record high of 2,658.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in bankruptcies is in part attributable to an
increasing amount of consumer debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Consumer bankruptcies contributed to 54 percent of the total
bankruptcies for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
There were 266 company liquidations in the third quarter, down
13 percent from the 306 previously but slightly higher than the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The surge in bankruptcies comes as economists revise upwards
their forecasts for unemployment.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures released by the New Zealand
Government, the unemployment rate in the country is now at 7.7
percent and the figure is expected to peak at 8.5 percent early
next year.
</P>
<P>
But, Bankers Trust economist Nick Bennenbroek recently said he
expected the unemployment rate will peak at 9.4 percent in
September 1999. That means the number of the unemployed will top
175,000 by then.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Public Schools Connected with Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey
conducted during the 1997-98 school year found that the number of
public schools in the United States providing key technologies
continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of all public schools in the country have
Internet access, up 21 percent over the prior year, according to
Market Data Retrieval (MDR), a technology research firm specializing
in analysis about the education market. MDR's statistics were based on
a survey of 33,000 public schools.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that connectivity within and among schools
has also significantly improved. Over 75 percent of schools reported
using a local area network (LAN) and 44 percent reported access on
wide area networks (WANs).
</P>
<P>
The number of computers for instructional use during the past five
years more than doubled, from 3.6 million units in 1992-93 to today's
total of 7.4 million. An addition of 560,000 computers were used by
administrators.
</P>
<P>
MDR said that the great growth in terms of location of Internet
access occurred in classrooms and administrative offices. Schools have
begun to provide Internet access throughout their buildings. As a
result, more than half of the schools now provide Internet access in
classrooms and administrative offices. Earlier reports estimated that
27 percent of classrooms had Internet access in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Classroom access to the Internet, however, has been a controversial
issue in the United States. A California-based nonprofit organization,
Learning in the Real World, said this week educators and parents are
now finding disturbing data casting doubt on the assumption that
computers play a valuable role in early primary grades.
</P>
<P>
And there is the problem of how to use classroom computers. A
survey published by Education Week magazine in September concluded
that what matters most are not computers, but what teachers and
students do with them. While classroom computers can boost student
test score if used properly, they can also have opposite effect if
they are in the hands of untrained teachers.
</P>
<P>
According to the MDR survey, there are an estimated 3.1 million
teachers in the United States today, most of whom learned about
computers on the job. About 23 percent of the schools reported that
almost all their teachers used computers on a daily basis for
instructional planning or teaching. But an equal number reported that
none of their teachers used computers daily.

cannot come to any final conclusion without knowing what the
Russian government will do in 1999 and what its budget will look
like.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Vyugin said, the experts would like to appraise the
entire financial policy of of the Russian government, including
fiscal policy for the fourth quarter and the next 15 months
overall. They want to know whether the Russian government
will resort to emissions constantly or whether this is just a
temporary measure, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov warned at a news
conference that unless Western loans come through, Russia will be
forced to print even more rubles.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that one of the stumbling blocks in receiving new
IMF loans is the lack of a 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
Zadornov informed journalists that the draft budget should be
ready for review by the government by mid-November.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican PM Favors Dialog in Guinea Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi Friday expressed the favor of his government for
a dialog to resolve the crisis in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi made the call at a press conference in Mozambican
capital Maputo, A Pan-African News Agency (Pana) report said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the renewed fighting in the tiny west African
country and the offer by Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernardo
Vieira to hold face-to-face talks with leader of the army mutiny
General Assumane Mane, the Mozambican premier said it was
"encouraging to hear from Nino Vieira that he is prepared to
enter into dialog."
</P>
<P>
"We want them to stop talking with guns and start talking with
words," Mocumbi was quoted as saying. He added that Mozambique
would play its role so that the dialog could bear fruits.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican prime minister called for solid institutions
under a democratic government in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
When asked if Mozambique would recognize diplomatically the
junta if it won, Mocumbi said that "we don't recognize regimes.
We recognize states."
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted in Guinea Bissau last weekend between the
mutineers and the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting killed the cease-fire signed in Praia,
Cape Verde on August 26.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Senegal has reportedly sent 1,000 troops to
reinforce its 2,000 soldiers already in the tiny country since
mid-June. Guinea (Conakry) also has troops there to support
Vieira's government.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Members Owe Over $40m in Unpaid Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) are currently owing the
organization more than 40 million U.S. Dollars in unpaid dues, an
ECOWAS spokesperson said in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Addressing newsmen on the forthcoming 21st ECOWAS summit
scheduled for October 30-31 in the Nigerian capital Thursday,
Adrienne Diop said the situation was so bad that the body was
currently experiencing lack of funds to maintain its daily
operation, let alone to carry out its programs.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 member countries of ECOWAS, only Nigeria, the
Republic of Benin and Cote d'Ivoire are reportedly up-to-date in
their financial commitment to the organization.
</P>
<P>
Non-payment of dues by member states have been an old problem
for ECOWAS. To solve the problem, the 1995 summit in Accra,
Ghana decided to impose a special levy of 0.5 percent on imported
goods and services from non-ECOWAS countries which would be
channeled into an ECOWAS fund.
</P>
<P>
The decision was supposed to take effect starting from 1996,
but had been delayed.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the spokesperson, some member countries
have now responded positively by opening accounts to deposit the
special levy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Mobile Phone Firm Operates in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni officially inaugurated the Mobile Telephone Network
(MTN) here Friday, the second national mobile operator in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Friday
evening said at the ceremony at State House Nakasero, Museveni
used MTN's hand-held mobile telephone set and spoke to South
African President Nelson Mandela who was in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
MTN, a South Africa-based company, is the second company to
have established itself in Uganda's mobile telecommunications
sector following the British company Celtel after the Ugandan
government put into operation the policy of economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Museveni urged the MTN Chief Executive
Officer in Uganda Thomas Bragaw to also run in Uganda projects in
poverty eradication, building health clinics and sponsoring
sports and helping women as they do in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Bragaw said his company is now operational in Kampala, Entebbe
(45 kilometers south of Kampala) and Jinja (80 kilometers east of
the capital) and that their services will soon cover a wider area
in the country. Their services are expected to reach northern
Uganda next year, said the manager.
</P>
<P>
In order to attract more business, MTN offers lower prices.
</P>
<P>
To counter the fierce competition from this newcomer, the
Celtel company announced big cuts in charges on Friday's
newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Leaders Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed a
Mideast peace agreement here Friday, with Israel pledging to
withdraw troops from more West Bank land and Palestine committing
to further Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
The land-for-peace interim accord was signed shortly after 5:30
p.m. (2130 GMT) at the end of a ceremony held in the East Room of
the White House. U.S. President Bill Clinton signed as witness and
King Hussein of Jordan participated in the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
All of them highlighted the importance of the accord which came
after nine days of hard talks and the whole Thursday night at an
east shore Maryland retreat.
</P>
<P>
"People around the world should be heartened by this agreement
today," which would contribute to the security and economic
benefit of the people in the Middle East, said Clinton at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Today, people are more secure" in the Middle East region with
the new agreement, said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important moment to give a secure and peaceful
future for our children and the children of our neighbors, the
Palestinians," added the Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We will never go back to violence and confrontation -- no
return to confrontation and violence," but will be in peaceful
co-existence for Palestinians and Israelis, said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Your security is our security," added Arafat, who specially
thanked King Hussein for his contributions to the success of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat are heroes today,"
U.S. Vice President Al Gore said in opening the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Gore also appreciated Clinton and King Hussein for their
important role in the achievement at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will
convene the Palestine National Council to revoke anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to transfer 14.2 percent of Israel
and Palestine jointly-controlled West Bank land to Palestinian
control, and Israel will release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three phases, allow the opening of the Palestinian airport in
Gaza, safe passage for Palestinians from Gaza to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel also committed to a third withdrawal from the West Bank,
but the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was achieved under the U.S. mediation and the
help from King Hussein, who was in the United States for cancer
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The talks at Wye Plantation, Maryland, with Clinton spending
about 78 hours to press both sides to make the hardest decisions.
And King Hussein also traveled twice to the summit site to help
bridge the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestine reached an historical agreement in Oslo,
Norway, in 1993, requesting the two sides to finish their talks on
the second phase of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the process had been in an impasse after Netanyahu took
a tougher position one and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Arafat stressed that the agreement underscores
that "the peace process is going ahead."

<HEADLINE> Mideast Agreement to be Signed in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will sign
on Friday a breakthrough land-for-peace deal at the White House
after a U.S.-Israeli settled their dispute on the release of an
Israeli spy.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony will be held at the White House at about
4:00 EDT in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the agreement has been snagged by the dispute centered
on the release of Jonathan Pollard, an American serving a life
sentence for spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel agreed to continue their negotiations over
the spy dispute after U.S. President Bill Clinton had intense
discussions with Netanyahu at the Wye Plantation, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Clinton rejected a clemency plea from Pollard based on
"the enormity of Mr. Pollard's offenses, his lack of remorse, the
damage done to our national security, the need for general
deterrence and the continuing threat to national security that he
posed."
</P>
<P>
Pollard, a Naval intelligence analyst, was arrested outside the
Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985 and sentenced to life in
prison in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Pollard, the only American who was sent to life sentence for
spying for a U.S. ally, pleaded guilty to espionage charges for
selling top- secret military intelligence that included satellite
photos, data on Soviet weaponry and ship movements.
</P>
<P>
The land-for-peace agreement was reached after 21 hour
face-to-face talks between Netanyahu and Arafat with presence of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The president spent about 78 hours over seven days at the
secluded Conference Center to press both sides to make "the
hardest decisions." Jordanian King Hussein traveled twice to the
conference site to help.
</P>
<P>
Among the critical issues resolved in the early hours of Friday
were the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the
convocation of the Palestine National Council to revoke its
anti-Israeli charter provisions and a package of security
measures.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will
convene the Palestine National Council to revocate anti-Israeli
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Israel will release 750 Palestinian prisoners in three phases,
allow the opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza, safe passage
for Palestinians from Gaza to the West Bank, an industrial zone in
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israel also committed to a third withdrawal from the West Bank,
but the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough deal is designed to bring closure to all
interim issues and allow final-status talks to begin.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive issues to be worked out in final talks include
the status of Jerusalem and the borders for a possible Palestinian
state. Those talks are scheduled to end on May 4, 1999, when the
Oslo accords expire.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Friday that it has
arrested a member of the Iranian outlawed Mujahideen Khalq
Organization (MKO) for entering Iran to "sabotage" the election of
the Experts Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Security-Law Enforcement of the Interior
Ministry Amir-Hussein Motahhar told the official news agency IRNA
that the MKO member was arrested in Bushehr, southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Motahhar did not give the identity of the detained MKO
member and the time of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
He said that the traces of the MKO were found in the southern
provinces of Yazd, Sistan-Baluchestan, Khuzestan and Bushehr and
the arrested MKO member has told some of his collaborators.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, one of the Iranian political groups which fought
against the former Shah regime before the Islamic revolution in
1979, was outlawed by Tehran in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the MKO, based in Iraq, has launched a
series of military attacks against the Iranian interests inside
and outside Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Motahhar said that the MKO members have been incapacitated
and effectively curtailed from causing any harm at all due to the
alert of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The third election of the Experts Assembly, which determines
the country's supreme leader, was kicked off at 0800 hours local
time (0430GMT) Friday and concluded at 2100 hours local time
(1730GMT) with extension.
</P>
<P>
A total of 167 candidates run for 86 seats of the Experts
Assembly and the result will be announced 48 hours after the
election closed.

<HEADLINE> Peres Welcomes Israeli-Palestinian Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres expressed Friday welcome to the peace agreement
reached by Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Wye Plantation
outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from the plantation said that after nine
days of intensive talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached an agreement on
issues discussed.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was planned at White House later Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over another 13.1 percent
of the West Bank to the Palestinians, release part of the 3,400
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, open two roads between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip as safe passage while the Palestinian
side convenes its National Council to abrogate parts of the
anti-Israeli articles from its Chart and other concrete plans to
strengthen security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached at the Wye Plantation was a victory for
the Oslo accords which kicked off the Mideast peace process, Peres
told the Israeli TV Channel 1.
</P>
<P>
Agreement means everything has been decided on paper and its
implementation is more important, Peres said, urging both sides to
implement the agreement according to agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, only a minority of people oppose the peace and the
majority must support what has been reached at Wye Plantation,
Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who is also a Knesset (Parliament) member, contributed
a great deal in the peace process, particularly in formulating the
Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's right-wing groups and politicians strongly
opposed what has been reached at the Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, told the Channel 1 that he will oppose
Netanyahu's decision to hand further West Bank land to the
Palestinians.

counseling and testing will be available in Zimbabwe next year,
Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister David Parirenyatwa said
Friday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
A strong leadership is needed to support efforts being taken

committed to invest in human resources development as shown in
huge budgetary allocations to the education sector every year.
</P>
<P>
"As a nation, we have the responsibility to improve the
quality and relevance of our education as we also endeavor to
inculcate in our children the spirit of hard work as well as a
high sense of discipline," Mugabe said.

<HEADLINE> Political Opponent Charged with Murder in Death of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The political opponent of a
state senator who was shot to death this week was arrested Friday
and charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
Byron (Low Tax) Looper was charged with first-degree murder in
the death of Senator Tommy Burks. He was arrested as he approached
his home in Cookeville, in neighboring Putnam County, Tennessee,
Cumberland County Sheriff Butch Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel real comfortable that we've got the right person,"
Burgess was quoted as saying by The associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Burks, 58, a respected legislator with 28 years of service, was
shot in his pickup truck Monday.
</P>
<P>
Looper, the Putnam County property assessor, had been missing
since then.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, authorities asked the public for help in finding
Looper, who was indicted last March on charges of theft and misuse
of office. He also is being sued for 1.2 million dollars by a
former girlfriend who claims he forced her to have sex and
illegally transferred ownership of her home to his name.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Looper's attorney, Lionel Barrett, confirmed
he had spoken to his client and said Looper might be willing to
discuss the case with police.
</P>
<P>
Barrett refused to say whether Looper had any knowledge about
the murder. Barrett said Looper recognizes his disappearance
"certainly has raised some legitimate questions."
</P>
<P>
Looper, 34, was born in Tennessee and attended West Point from
1983-85, then spent most of his 20s in Georgia, where his mother
lived.
</P>
<P>
He ran for the Georgia House at 23 and lost, then worked three
years as a legislative aide. After working various other jobs, he
came back to Tennessee and lost a race for the state House in
1994. He won the Putnam County assessor's seat in 1996 after
running a highly negative campaign against the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has fired employees, filed lawsuits against
other public officials, been sued by former workers and been
involved in a fist fight between his employee and a taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
His trial on charges of theft and misuse of office was set for
December.
</P>
<P>
He got the Republican nomination for the state Senate because
no one else ran for it. The state Republican Party had issued a
statement Wednesday distancing itself from Looper.
</P>
<P>
Burks' widow, Charlotte, announced she would be a write-in
candidate to replace her husband. Under state law the Democrats
cannot replace Burks on the ballot because he died less than 30
days before the election. That left a write-in campaign as their
only option.
</P>
<P>
Burks served four terms in the state House before being elected
to the Senate in 1978. He never missed a day of work during his
28-year legislative career.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Fatal injuries caused by
car crashes, fires and other unintentional causes were the fifth
leading cause of death in the United States, said a U.S. public
service organization in a news release Friday.
</P>
<P>
Unitentional-injury deaths totaled 93,800 in 1997, down
slightly following four consecutive annual increases, according to
the National Safety Council, an Illinois-based nongovernmental and
federally chartered organization, which will release its 78th
annual report on unintentional injuries next week. The
organization estimated 19.3 million disabling injuries in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Motor-vehicle deaths, totaling 43,200, were on top of all
categories. Disabling injuries were 2.3 million. There were 214.5
million registered vehicles in the United States in 1997, with
181.7 million licensed drivers. On the average, 118 people died
and another 6,300 were injured each day because of car crash.
</P>
<P>
The organization, focusing on occupational health and safety,
traffic safety, first-aid and home safety, said that the cost of
unintentional injuries in 1997 totaled 478.3 billion U.S. dollars.
This includes estimates of economic costs of fatal and nonfatal
injuries together with employer costs, vehicle damage costs and
fire losses. Besides, lost quality of life from those injuries is
valued at an additional 1,053 billion dollars, making the
comprehensive cost of 1,531 billion dollars in 1997.

CAIRO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Minister of Commerce,

</P>
<P>
Vavindele, who is also the chief of the Ministerial Council of

</P>
<P>
"But thereafter such freedoms and liberties will revert,

in the court martials," Masakeng said.
</P>
<P>
A group of junior Lesotho soldiers launched a mutiny in early
September, accusing Mosakeng and 29 other senior army officers of
being puppets of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
Mosakeng and the senior officers were forced to resign at gun
point.
</P>
<P>
Under Lesotho's Defense Act, any person found to have been
involved in mutiny, or who intended to join it, could be charged
with treason, thus facing death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Lesotho government vowed to prosecute the 32
soldiers who were allegedly involved in the September coup
against Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and the current
military leadership.
</P>
<P>
In terms of Lesotho's judicial system enshrined in the
county's constitution, civil courts have no jurisdiction over the
military.
</P>
<P>
Under the kingdom's constitution, military court martial are
not subordinate to any other court of the land.
</P>
<P>
Mosakeng dismissed claims that the detained soliders had been
tortured and maltreated.
</P>
<P>
He said representatives from the International Red Cross, the
Southern African Development Community, and South African high
commissioner were allowed Thursday to visit the detained soldiers
at Lesotho's Maximum Security Prison just outside the capital of
Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The detainees' legal representatives had also been allowed to
see their clients, but were only allowed to investigate torture
and maltreatment claims. A doctor was also sent to check their
state of health.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the suspected mutineers were reportedly arguing
that their clients have a right to legal representation even at
this stage of the military investigation.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's opposition political parties and human rights
lawyers claimed that the detained soldiers were being coerced,
during interrogation, to implicate other people in the mutiny.
However, the LDF has denied these claims.

WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Human Genome Project,
a federal program to sequence the entire human genes, may be
accomplished by 2003, two years ahead of schedule, according to a
statement published in Science Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Human Genome Project's ultimate goal is to accomplish the
about 100,000 genes that locate in human DNA, according to the
statement by the national Human Genome Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"Recent technological developments and experience with
large-scale sequencing provide increasing confidence that it
will be possible to complete an accurate, high-quality sequence
of the human genome by the year of 2003, two years sooner than
previously predicted," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that about 70 percent of the work will be
accomplished by agencies of the Department of Energy and the
National Institutes of Health, and the rest will be finished by
an international team and the Sanger Center, financed by British
Wellcome Trust.

TEHRAN -- Iran Friday morning kicked off the election for the
powerful Assembly of Experts, which under constitution has the
power to determine and superview the supreme leader.

entrenched hardliners, who dominated almost all but the
administrative power, and the moderates, represented by President
Mahammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects Military Threat Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday submitted
an alternative draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council,
rejecting a West-sponsored draft which would otherwise give a
green light to military action against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
The draft, proposed by the Russian Mission to the United
Nations, extended a welcome to the October 16 agreement signed in
Belgrade, capital of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), by
the Yugoslav government and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on the establishment of a
verification mission in Kosovo, Serbia's province of mainly ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution reiterated "the commitment of all U.N.
member states to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
FRY."
</P>
<P>
Russia, the draft said, invited "the OSCE to establish and
deploy rapidly a verification mission in Kosovo in accordance with
the agreement between the FRY and the OSCE in order to monitor the
compliance by the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Albanian
leadership and all other elements of the Kosovo Albanian
community" with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The draft also urged the FRY, the Kosovo Albanian leadership
and all other elements of the Kosovo Albanian community and all
others concerned to "comply fully with the requirements of U.N.
resolutions 1160 and 1199 and cooperate in good faith with the
Verification Mission in Kosovo and the Air Verification Mission
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia called upon all parties concerned "to take all
appropriate steps" to ensure that the signed agreements "are fully
implemented, and that personnel performing functions under this
resolution are not subject to the threat or use of force or
interference of any kind, as well as to respect their freedom of
movement."
</P>
<P>
The Russian-proposed draft also asked the verification missions
and the relevant organizations to keep the 15-member Security
Council "fully and regularly informed through the U.N.
secretary-general regarding the implementation of the resolution,"
if adopted.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began closed-door consultations on the
Russian draft Friday morning, and the session was later adjourned
without adopting any resolution. The Security Council is scheduled
to resume consultations on Kosovo at 17:00 (EST) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries, including the United States and the
United Kingdom, are pressing the Security Council for a resolution
to be adopted as soon as possible as the clock is ticking towards
the NATO-imposed deadline, which expires next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which has a veto on the Security Council, has vowed to
kill any resolution endorsing the use of military force against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of Friday's first round of consultations, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun told
reporters that China "has difficulties in principle" with a
resolution which would allow the use of force against a sovereign
state and the interference of the internal affair of the FRY.
</P>
<P>
Also after the council consultations were adjourned, the
president of the Security Council, Jeremy Greenstock of the United
Kingdom, told reporters, "We have broken up to have further group
discussions and exchanges between delegations."

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges UNITA to Follow Lusaka Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Friday evening urged Angola's former rebel movement, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), to
abide by the Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the nation on the eve of Zambia's 34th
independence anniversary at the state television, Chiluba also
reiterated Lusaka's commitment to regional peace.
</P>
<P>
In an half-hour speech, Chiluba said his country is much
concerned over Angola's peace process which is facing great
challenges now since the UNITA led by Jonas Savimbi has resumed
its offensives against the Angolan government forces.
</P>
<P>
"The intransigence of UNITA is a natural, deep regret and
concern to us," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged the UNITA to comply with the Lusaka peace
agreement which was signed in 1994 under the U.N. auspices to end
the country's two-decade long civil war and bring peace to the
country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I, on behalf of our government, would like to appeal to Dr.
Savimbi (once yet) to abide by the Lusaka Protocol to bring a
speedy end to the bloodshed and suffering of the Angolan people,"
said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
As a broker of the Lusaka peace accord, Zambia is "pleased to
witness the fruitful completion of the peace process in Angola,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Chiluba denied the report carried last
month in some South African newspapers that Zambia intended to
provide the rebels from Congo (Kinshasa) with bases in its
territory.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia is a peace-loving country. We've no intentions now or
in the future of providing any bases for any rebel groups
fighting in the Congo or Angola," Chiluba stressed.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his country will "do everything possible to
ensure the peace initiatives in the region are fully supported."
</P>
<P>
Zambia needs peace, but peace is not complete since its
neighbors do not enjoy peace, said Chiluba, who expressed
the hope that peace will resume in Congo (K) and Angola.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) to Revise Mining Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) has earmarked plans to revise its mining
code and launch a fresh survey of mining areas, reports from
Kinshasa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The Code could come out at the end of the year or the
beginning of next year," a senior mining ministry official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said the two existing mining codes will be
scrapped and a new code brought in, applying to all mine sectors
and taking into account technological advances.
</P>
<P>
It would include clauses on providing security for investors
and fiscal incentives, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a
mining conference would be held in November in Kinshasa with the
aim of drawing up new rules with assistance from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
These plans are going ahead even though some mining areas in
the east of the country are held by rebels, who have been
fighting President Laurent Kabila since the beginning of August.
</P>
<P>
Copper and cobalt production in southern Katanga Province has
not been interrupted by the war but output in Kasai province,
mainly of diamonds, has been affected because some airports have
been closed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila granted mining rights as his forces moved across the
former Zaire from late 1996, ousting late ruler Mobutu Sese Seko
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mining firms said deals are now being called into question by
Kabila's government. Government officials in return claim that some
firms have broken the terms of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
The current war in Congo (k) has held up the finalization of
key mining deals between the Gecamines state firm and an array of
foreign companies, including Tanke Fungurume, Canada's First
Quantum, Anglo-American and Union Miniere.

<HEADLINE> Maryland Grand Jury Subpoenas Linda Tripp's Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A Maryland grand jury
investigating Linda Tripp subpoenaed one of her lawyers Friday,
demanding that he produce any tape recordings Tripp made of former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Joe Murtha said he would fight the subpoena issued in the
Howard County, Maryland, grand jury inquiry being conducted by
Maryland prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli. He is examining whether
Tripp broke the state wiretapping law.
</P>
<P>
Montanarelli does not have any tapes that Tripp made. They are
in the custody of Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
In order to build a wiretapping case, Montanarelli would need
to pursue gaining custody of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
"This is an invasion of the attorney-client privilege and we're
going to fight this all the way," The Associated Press quoted
Murtha as saying.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena demands that Murtha appear before the grand jury
and produce originals or copies of any tapes containing the voice
of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Tripp's other lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, said, "This is
another attempt by the prosecutor in Maryland to intimidate Linda
Tripp and her lawyers and this latest step is further evidence of
the political persecution of our client."
</P>
<P>
Tripp also is under scrutiny by Starr. He is investigating
whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes
which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction
in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
</P>
<P>
Zaccagnini said his client is still cooperating with Starr, as
she has been since last January 12, but that cooperation would end
immediately if Starr's office targets Tripp.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed a
land-for-peace agreement here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The interim accord was signed shortly after 5:30 p.m. (2130
GMT) at a ceremony held in the East Room of the White House. U.S.
President Bill Clinton signed as witness, and King Hussein of
Jordan participated in the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"People around the world should be heartened for the
agreement," which would contribute to the security and economic
benefit of the people in the Mideast, said Clinton at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Today, people are more secure" in the Mideast region with the
new agreement, said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We will not go back to confrontation and violence" but will be
in peaceful co-existence for Palestinians and Israelis, said
Arafat. "Your security is our security," added Arafat, who
specially thanked King Hussein for his contributions to the
success of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat are heros today,"
said U.S. Vice President Al Gore, opening the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Gore also appreciated Clinton and King Hussein for their
important role in the achievement at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will
convene the Palestine National Council to revoke anti-Israel
clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to transfer 14.2 percent of the West
Bank land to Palestinian control, and Israel will release 750
Palestinian prisoners in three phases, allow the opening of the
Palestinian airport in Gaza, safe passage for Palestinians from
Gaza to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel also committed to a third withdrawal from the West Bank,
but the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was achieved after a nine-day hard talks at Wye
Plantation, Maryland, with Clinton spending about 78 hours to
press both sides to make the hardest decisions.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein, who was in the United States for cancer
treatment, also traveled twice to the summit site to help bridge
the negotiators.

34th independence anniversary which falls on Saturday, Chiluba
said the tripartite convention to be attended by private sector
practitioners, industrial and economic experts and government
officials should be called as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said the convention will be tasked to review government's
industrial policy framework to identify growth sectors and devise
means to stimulate their productivity.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba outlined some measures to stimulate the productivity
which include the development of a dynamic and internationally
competitive private sector; the attraction of both local and
foreign investment through specific incentives and the promotion
of competitive small-scale enterprises in a bid to create formal
and informal employment and promote income distribution.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that while Zambia's economic adjustment program
received the full endorsement and support of cooperating partners
at the beginning, it is not the case now.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last two years, we have witnessed limited donor
support to our economic program particularly in the area of
balance of payment support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba blamed the lack of balance of payment support on
donors' misconception of his government's intentions on political
reform.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced Friday the approval of the second annual loan
for Ethiopia under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), equivalent to about 42 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The concessionary loan will be used to support the Ethiopian
government's economic and financial program for the fiscal year
1998-99. The loan will be disbursed in two equal semiannual
installments, the first of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The government's medium-term economic strategy is aimed at
securing fast, broad-based and more equitable economic growth in
the context of macroeconomic stability. The principal
macroeconomic objectives for 1998-2001 include to achieve an
average annual GDP growth of 7.75 percent a year, contain
inflation below 4 percent, and rebuild gross foreign reserves to a
more comfortable level. The external current account deficit is
projected to remain at 8 to 8.5 percent of GDP due to growing
imports and weak prospects for coffee export prices.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia joined the IMF in December 1945. Its quota is about
139 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF resources
totaled about 89 million dollars.

LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets were
mixed to weaker on Friday, depressed by Wall Street's losses,
although this was in part offset by a more stable dollar.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed slightly down as a sprinkling of
profit-taking after recent strong gains pushed leading stocks
lower.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth figures got the day off to a negative start as
they showed the economy was performing rather better than
expected, relieving some of the pressure on the Bank of England
for a big rate drop.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE eventually closed down 12.8 points at 5217.1. The
banking sector led the downward FTSE trail as profit takers crept
in on previous gains.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares were mixed as the key car and
financial sectors continued to make investors jittery. The
leading Dax finished 3 points lower at 4451.
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a little more buying interest at this
stage," said a London-based analyst at a large German bank.

In Paris, French shares remained in the doldrums during the

UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The chief of a U.N. arm
said on Friday that the world body has "a broad mandate to foster
a human rights-based approach to development".

James Gustave Speth, Administrator of the United Nations
Development Program made the remarks in his message on the

He said: "For without adequate investments in the well-being

<P>
"In the 50th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, we have a special responsibility to hold the spotlight
on poverty as a denial of the most basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is a cruel abuse of human rights. Among the 4.4
billion people who live in developing countries, almost
three-fifths live in communities without basic sanitation; almost
one-third are without safe drinking water; a quarter lack adequate
housing; and a fifth are undernourished."
</P>
<P>
What the world needs most desperately is "a reordered sense of
priorities, for without effective action, we can expect to pay a
much higher price in continued social disaffection reflected most
graphically in conflicts and social disruption, disease
transmission, drug trafficking and terrorism," he warned.

LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Friday his government did not discuss former Chilean
president Augusto Pinochet's visit to London with the Spanish
authorities prior to his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Cook said in a letter to his Conservative counterpart Michael
Howard that the London police told Foreign Office officials of
their plans to arrest Pinochet in advance.
</P>
<P>
"As on previous occasions when Senator Pinochet has visited the
UK, the government was made aware in advance and the normal
arrangements for a visit by a former head of state were made,"
Cook said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the government nor the police had any contact with the
Spanish authorities regarding the visit before Senator Pinochet
arrived in the country," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested last Friday while recovering from surgery
at a private London hospital for alleged involvement in torture
and genocide.
</P>
<P>
The British government has made it clear that it would take
only a judicial view of the extradition request from Spanish judge
Baltasar Garzon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pinochet's lawyers have launched a legal challenge
on Pinochet's arrest in bid to free him and a hearing on the
challenge to the extradition order has been adjourned until

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet Over Kosovo on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council adopted "a provisional plan" to convene a formal meeting
on Kosovo on Saturday morning, the president of the 15-seat body,
Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom, said.
</P>
<P>
The council president told reporters after the council's
closed-door consultations that the council's formal meeting will
kick off at 11:00 a.m. (EST) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"A vote (on the draft resolution) is likely tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia again blocked a draft resolution at the Security Council
by submitting an alternative one. The draft, sponsored by Western
countries such as Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom,
contained the wording that would allow NATO to intervene over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among the draft sponsors continued behind closed
doors in an effort to adopt the measures over this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Russia, with a veto power on the Security Council, has
repeatedly vowed to kill any resolution allowing the use of
force against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the council's Friday morning session, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin Huasun lashed
out at a regional organization concerned, saying that it could not
"unilaterally decide, without seeking authorization from the
Council, to take military action against Yugoslavia and grossly
interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats reported that Brazil and Costa Rica, the council's
two non-permanent members, also had raised objections to giving
NATO carte blanche to intervene over the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is Serbia' province, where ethnic Albanians, who make
up some 90 percent of the province's population of 2 million,
are battling with Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Method to Screen Sheep for Mad Cow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said Friday
that they have developed a practical technique to screen sheep for
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the so-called mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
Until now there has been no simple way to distinguish the
effects of BSE on sheep from those of scrapie, a related
spongiform disease with no apparent consequences for human health.
</P>
<P>
Currently, to test sheep for BSE is a bioassay, which involves
inserting suspected infectious tissue into the brains of
laboratory mice and observing them.
</P>
<P>
However, it takes two years for the mice to succumb to the
disease under careful observation and carefully controlled
conditions. The overall cost approaching 50,000 U.S. dollars per
sheep, which makes it impractical to use.
</P>
<P>
It was confirmed two years ago that BSE can be passed to sheep
through their food. But so far among the national flock of 42
million sheep in the UK, only nine sheep have been checked for
BSE.
</P>
<P>
The new "molecular screening" method, developed by professor
John Collinge and colleagues at St Mary's Hospital, London, has
the potential to test BSE in sheep for only a few U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The technique is based on a type of test called Western Blot
analysis, which smashes up the abnormal prion protein thought to
cause the disease into fragments and detects different strains by
the different pattern of fragments.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Collinge's group has published the results of a
preliminary survey to establish the new screening method in the
journal Neuroscience Letters.
</P>
<P>
More work must be done to perfect the test but "it looks as
though it is going to be an effective means of differentiating BSE
in sheep from sheep scrapie", said professor Collinge.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Causes Mouse Disease Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The El Nino effect has led to a
spread of a potentially fatal disease carried by mice in the
United States, American scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a lung
infection which causes eye pain and other side effects, has more
than tripled in the U.S. due to El Nino effect, researchers from
the University of New Mexico wrote in the Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 and 1992, the effects of El Nino in the southwestern of
America led to the first outbreak of the disease in people living
in Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Around five cases of the disease were noted then, but since
1995 there have only been around four cases a year in the four
states.
</P>
<P>
However, Doctor Brian Hjelle and colleagues reported that they
have seen 14 cases between January and August in 1998, the figure
was more than that of the whole of 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believed that the significant increase of the
disease were linked to the El Nino of 1997-98, which brought
milder winters and increased rainfall, causing the mouse
population to increase and made them more likely to nest in
buildings used by humans.

<HEADLINE> Opening Up Policy Benefits China, World: Finnish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China's policy of opening to
the outside world has benefited itself and its partners in the
world, Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said before embarking
on a five-day official visit to Beijing next Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese correspondents in Helsinki,
Lipponen said that China witnessed rapid social and economic
developments in the last decade, which helped to improve people's
living standards.
</P>
<P>
He said China is playing an important political and economic
role not only in Asia but also in the whole world. Its
international responsibilities are reflected in its responses and
reactions to the ongoing Asia economic crisis and the nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan that threatened the regional security
in early summer this year.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Finnish relations, Lipponen said that ties of
friendship and trust have developed vigorously with continuing
dialogue and frequent exchanges at high levels.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the formal and informal meetings in the last few
years between Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and his Chinese
counterpart Jiang Zemin, which helped to strengthen bilateral
relations and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also noted increasing cooperation between
the two countries in business projects and smooth development of
bilateral trade. By the end of 1996, Finland's indirect investment
to China totaled 34 million U.S. dollars. Last year, China became
Finland's third largest non-European trade partner after the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
On relations between China and the European Union, Lipponen
said China is an important partner of the EU. Developing relations
with China will be high on the agenda when Finland serves the
rotating EU presidency in the latter half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish prime minister said that his forthcoming visit
illustrates Finland's great interest in China and that he looked
forward to talks with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Farmers Warned of Risk of Using Imported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi rice scientists have
warned farmers of the risk of using hybrid paddy seeds imported by
the private sector and distributed to farmers without
certification by the National Seed Board.
</P>
<P>
The warning came from scientists of the Bangladesh Rice
Research Institute (BRRI), a major English daily newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a seed crisis following the recent ten-week-long
devastating flood, the government has allowed the private sector
to import 2,200 tons of hybrid rice seeds for winter cultivation,
and private seed dealers have imported four varieties of hybrid
seeds from India, which are being released to farmers without
field testing, The Independent observed.
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to introduction of hybrid seeds, but it
must be adapted and developed locally to get maximum benefit under
the prevailing agro-ecological conditions of the country," BRRI
director general, Dr. Muhammad Abdul Hamid Miah, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The immediate problem with the newly imported hybrid rice is
that the farmers will not be able to get second generation seed
for cultivation next time because of its genetic characteristics,
and farmers will have to buy seed at a higher cost every time,
BRRI scientists stated.
</P>
<P>
According to the genetic characteristics of the newly imported
hybrid rice seeds, there was a risk of getting segregated
production in second generation, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Rice is the staple food in Bangladesh, and it is grown in an
area of 10.17 million hectares out of total cropped area of 13.70
million hectares, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh uses 350,000 tons of paddy seeds annually for
cultivation of summer rice, monsoon rice and winter rice.

encouraging international symposia.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar will always take into consideration of the relations
with its neighboring countries as well as with others in the
region, and if unexpected difficulties and obstacles arise, it
will continue to cooperate with other nations for regional
development and security on the basis of mutual understanding and
in a spirit of friendship, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since integration into the ASEAN in July last year, Myanmar has
been working closely with other ASEAN members, forming respective
committees and groups in all sectors and taking an active part in
various meetings and activities of the association.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Adopts Declaration on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian parliament Friday
endorsed a declaration which insisted on peaceful settlement of
the Kosovo crisis and promised, on the condition of non-
involvement, support for NATO's military operations taken as a
last resort.
</P>
<P>
The declaration on Kosovo and relations with the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) was backed by 150 members of parliament
(MPs) from the ruling Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) and Popular
Union, and the alliance for National Salvation and the Euro-left.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven MPs from the opposition Socialist Party voted
against and six independents abstained.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voiced readiness to grant NATO access to
Bulgarian airspace in line with the Constitution, the Partnership
for Peace Framework Document and the agreement between the NATO
members and associated countries.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that the government seek clear security
guarantees from NATO and that consultations and talks be held to
further deepen cooperation with NATO in view of the country's
future membership.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said Bulgaria was ready to maintain good-
neighborly ties with Yugoslavia and hoped that the conflicting
sides in the Kosovo crisis would fully implement the related
accords by the agreed time limit.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said after the vote that
national security was in the hands of a strategic majority which
watched over it. He said, "I am glad that it was patriotism, not
Comintern internationalism, that prevailed in the National
Assembly."
</P>
<P>
During the six-hour debate, all parliamentary groups argued for
the draft declarations they had proposed. Hristo Bisserov,
chairman of the National Security Committee, said the UDF would
support a joint draft declaration.
</P>
<P>
Two drafts by Socialist MPs were rejected. One sponsored by
Socialist leader Georgi Purvanov suggested that Bulgaria should
not get involved in military operations in Kosovo directly,
indirectly or under the UN aegis.
</P>
<P>
The other sponsored by Stefan Gaitandjiev proposed that the
parliament bar foreign military aircraft from using Bulgarian
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Purvanov accused Kostov of having concealed for 24 hours a NATO
request for access to airspace. He said Kostov's quick reply had
forced the Consultative Council for National Security to formulate
a hurried opinion with the president.
</P>
<P>
The parliament's role, Purvanov said, had been reduced to
approving government's decisions. He reiterated the Socialists'
view that the government's decision in favor of granting NATO
access to Bulgaria's airspace when necessary was
unconstitutional.

<P>
YANGON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- First Secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt
said here Friday that "democracy is not an 'ism' but a form of
'practice', a method so to speak."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the two-day
"International Symposium on Interaction for Progress: Myanmar in
ASEAN," co-sponsored by the Office of Strategic Studies of the
Myanmar Ministry of Defense, the Information and Resource Center
of Singapore and the Sasakawa Peace Foundation of Japan.
</P>
<P>
There are vast differences between countries of the East and
those of the West in culture, customs, traditions and historical
development. And there is no way to force them into the same
mould, Khin Nyunt stated.
</P>
<P>
"In our country people do enjoy equal rights and there is no
race, religion or gender discrimination. Our priorities are clear
and definite. They are to prevent famine, eliminate poverty and
close the gap between the rich and the poor," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> India Exports Fissile Material to US, France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- India has exported thorium
components to unidentified companies in the United States and
France, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman R. Chidambaram
told a parliamentary consultative committee, the Business Standard
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chidambaram did not specify if the exports took place before or
after India's nuclear tests in May this year. According to a
document recently submitted to the committee on AEC's activities,
thorium rods were exported to France and thorium buttons to the
United States. These followed heavy water exports to South Korea
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Thorium rods are the most crucial component of a nuclear
reactor. Thorium buttons are placed inside the rods that are used
to fuel nuclear fission.
</P>
<P>
The United States had imposed an informal ban on any deal with
India involving nuclear material as New Delhi is not a signatory
to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Cost advantages of buying
fissile material from India must have outweighed political
considerations for the importing company, some sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The nine-nation Wills
International Cup cricket tournament, the first international
sports event to be hosted by Bangladesh, will start here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will play the opening match, the only
pre-quarterfinal, with New Zealand at the 40,000-capacity
Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Besides Zimbabwe and New Zealand, Australia, England, India,
Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies will also
participate in the knock-out meet between October 24 and November
2.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to
inaugurate the nine-day event at a 10-minute opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the tournament, the Bangladeshi government
spent about 130 million take to install floodlights and elect
ronic scoreboard at the stadium, and about 3,000 police and
servicemen have been deployed around the venue to secure a
successful hosting of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Thursday, the Energy Ministry pledged to
ensure undisrupted power supply to the stadium during the
matches. Loadshedding is a common phenomenon in the capital city
of the South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Eight international umpires and referees have arrived here to
officiate the matches.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter-final will be played between England and
South Africa on Sunday, followed by world champions Sri Lanka
clashing with winners of the first match in the second
quarter-final on Monday.
</P>
<P>
India will take on Australia in the third quarter-final on
October 28, and the last quarter-final will be played between
Pakistan and West Indies on the next day.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals will be played on October 30 and 31, followed
by the final on November 1. Champions of the tourney will pocket
100,000 U.S. dollars and runners-up  60,000 dollars, out of the
total cash award of more than 400,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh made a failed bid against the United Arab Emirates
to gain the stewardship in mid-1997 when the International
Cricket Committee (ICC) decided to hold the meet in Sharjah.
</P>
<P>
The ICC gave the authority to Dhaka in June this year when
Sharjah decided to give up due to various reasons including
sponsorship deals.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Send Observers to Transdnestria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will send ten military
observers to Moldova's Transdnestrian area to promote the
implementation of the agreement which encourages political
solution of the regional conflict, Ukrainian government announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's defense, justice and foreign ministries would
coordinate to work out an action program for the military
observers and hand it to the government within a month.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, leaders from Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and
Transdnestria signed an accord in Ukraine's port city of Odessa,
promising to increase mutual trust and contact between Moldova and
Transdnestria.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Ukraine, as a coordinator for political
settlement and a country to ensure the Transdnestria's special
position in the area on the basis of Moldova's territorial
integrity, shall send observers to the region.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said at an informal meeting of leaders of Ukraine, Romania and
Moldova in Moldova's capital Chisinau, that Ukraine is always
supportive for Moldova's territorial integrity and non-violation
of its borders.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also said Ukraine stood for Russia's pullout of its
troops stationed in Transdnestria.
</P>
<P>
Transdnestria, an important industrial region of Moldova, began
to seek independence in 1990 and later declared itself an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum granting Transdnestria broad autonomy within the
Moldova border was signed last year in Moscow, but Transdnestrian
leaders insist they want full statehood.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia: Rugova's Reaction to Kosovo Agreement Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic Friday praised the ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova's welcome of the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement as a
positive sign toward the settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rugova said on Thursday that he welcomed the accord.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Jovanovic said that "we consider
it positive, and we think there should be a step forward to
continue unconditional dialogue in order to concretize the
political frameworks and the timetable" as spelled out in the
peace accord reached between Milosevic and the U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement has reaffirmed that Kosovo
will remain part of Yugoslavia and new local governments in the
the province will be elected in nine months.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the Yugoslav government is ready to
resume unconditional dialogues with the ethnic Albanians and hopes
that the negotiations will be kicked off soon.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the unconditional dialogue will be
resumed and the political framework which has been worked out and
publicly announced be respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister also ruled out the possibility
that the armed groups of ethnic Albanians, the so-called "Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA)," would take part in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Being a terrorist organization...they have no place in this,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams NATO Threat of Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic said on Friday that any possible military attack
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would not only
violate international laws, but also destabilize southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no ground for any pressure or any threat,
especially any military threat, against Yugoslavia as a sovereign
European country. These threats simply have no legal basis in
international law," Jovanovic said here in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Military attacks by NATO could only encourage "terrorist
activities" in Kosovo and "help those who are against peaceful
solution", he said, referring apparently to the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), the ethnic Albanian armed groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
He warned that NATO's military intervention could achieve
nothing positive, but would be damaging to Yugoslavia, to southern
Europe and to whole Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that Yugoslavia has fulfilled requirements of
the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Kosovo,
including the pullout of special police forces which, he said, are
now in their barracks.
</P>
<P>
"There are only regular police forces to maintain public law
and order" in Kosovo, he said, adding that if they were also
withdrawn, there would appear a security vacuum in no one's
interest.
</P>
<P>
He said that to the contrary of the reports by Western media,
the Yugoslav government is helping and guaranteeing the freedom
and safety of the refugees returning to Kosovo. A total of 100,000
refugees have returned while the government has set up 17 refugee
centers to distribute food, clothes, medicine and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
He complained that despite reports by humanitarian
organizations on positive developments in Kosovo, NATO was still
making preparation for military strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO and others are trying to launch a new rule in
international relations, the so-called right to humanitarian
intervention which is an expression of those who are for an
unipolar world," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO countries want to make a precedent out of the Kosovo
crisis "to have free hands to intervene militarily wherever they
wish in the world", Jovanovic said, adding that "this is of course
a big danger for the world order and for international relations".
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Western countries contradict
themselves on the issue of Kosovo. "They speak that they support
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, but on the other side,
they are pressuring Yugoslavia, threatening it, even militarily,
when Yugoslavia wants to safeguard the territorial integrity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslavia will maintain an independent foreign
policy despite pressures from Western countries which want it to
be obedient and to play by their rules.
</P>
<P>
While Yugoslavia wants to have normal relations with the United
States and other Western countries, "we still want to maintain
that we are an independent country, that we are not second-rate
country, that we should ask nobody how to arrange our home
affairs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Exports Fair Sees 3 Billion U.S. Dollars of Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese companies clinched a
total of 3.07 billion U.S. dollars worth of export contracts in
the first week of the 84th session of the Chinese Export
Commodities Fair.
</P>
<P>
It is a decline of 3.39 percent compared with the same period
of last year's event, according to China Daily today. But the
figure represents a slight improvement of 0.47 percent of the
first seven days of the spring fair, which took place from April
15-30 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Trading is normal in the first week of the fair," an official
said.
</P>
<P>
The fair, China's biggest trade event of the year, opened on
October 15 in this provincial capital and will end on October 30.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted the twice-yearly fair will result in the
signing of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars worth of export
contracts, it said.
</P>
<P>
The official urged domestic companies attending the fair make
every effort to achieve this goal in the second half of the fair
by diversifying into world markets and trying to contribute to the
country's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Export volume of light industrial products and arts and crafts
reached 1.02 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for a third of
transactions signed in the first week.
</P>
<P>
Exports of machinery and electronics came to 850 million
U.S. dollars, representing 27.69 percent, while textiles and
garments had 640 million U.S. dollars worth of export contracts,
or 20.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mideast Peace Process Back on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace
process was officially declared going ahead with the signing of an
interim peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in
Washington on Friday under the mediation of the United States and
the help from King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as well as U.S.
President Bill Clinton, after nine days of closed-door marathon
bargaining at the Wye Plantation Conference Center, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure from the United States and with a timely
reach-out from King Hussein, who came from a cancer treatment in
the U.S., the two sides finally had narrowed their tremendous gaps
and agreed at last to sign the historical document at the White
House Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The core of the achievement was Israel's further withdrawal
from the West Bank in exchange for firmer Palestinian commitment
to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank land in three months while the
Palestinians will convene the Palestine National Council to revoke
anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Also, Israel agreed to transfer 14.2 percent of the West Bank
territory now jointly policed by Israel and the Palestinian
Authority to Palestinian jurisdiction, and free 750 Palestinian
prisoners, allow the opening of an airport in Gaza and the safe
passage for Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, all sides highlighted the significance of the
accord which is believed to give a new push to the stalemated
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
As designed by the 1993 Oslo Agreement, it could be seen as a
major step toward a final settlement of the long-protracted
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said at the ceremony that "people around the world
should be heartened by this agreement," which will contribute to
the security and economic benefit of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who toughened the Israeli position after his
assumption of office in 1996, which was followed by a 19-month
impasse of the peace process, noted that with the accord, "people
are more secure" in the Middle East and it is an important moment
to secure a peaceful future for the Israeli and Palestinian
children alike.
</P>
<P>
Stating his commitment to security, Arafat said, "your security
is our security" and "We will never go back to violence and
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The accord restarted the engine of the peace process in the
region. This is a desire shared by both Israel and the
Palestinians as well as the United States. However, as the accord
itself came from tremendous and pain-taking efforts, its
implementation calls for more serious efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Also the Americans have vowed to continue their role in the
process. As experts here note that a sustained and direct U.S.
involvement will be needed to keep the accord on course and
ultimately gain a final peace treaty in the region.

<HEADLINE> Conference to Focus on Heavy Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations-sponsored
conference on heavy oil is to be held in Beijing between October
27-30.
</P>
<P>
The seventh U.N. institutions for Training and research
(UNITAR) international conference on heavy crude and tar sands is
expected to be attended by more than 500 representatives from the
U.N. and 24 countries.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "Heavy oil -- a major energy
resource for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time such a conference to be held outside
the American continent, today's "China Daily" says. The previous
six conferences were held in Canada, the United States and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
"The reason to choose Beijing as the conference site is mainly
that the heavy oil industry in Asia, especially in China and
Indonesia, has been booming in recent years," said conference
chairman Wang Naiju.
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC) and the China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec), and
co-sponsored by UNITAR's Heavy Crude and Tar Sands Center, Petrole
De Venezuela SA, and the Energy Department of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on two key problems: finding new ways
to improve technology and strengthen management to reduce
production costs, and mapping out a development scheme able to
cater to the increasingly critical need for environmental
protection, Wang said.

<P>
HELSINKI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen welcomed Saturday the latest achievements in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, hoping that the achievements
would increase mutual trust among the conflicting parties in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed a Mideast peace agreement in
Washington on Friday, with Israel pledging to withdraw troops from
more West Bank land and Palestine committing to further Israeli
security.
</P>
<P>
Halonen said that after hard negotiations, a new agreement was
finally reached on the Mideast conflict and this demonstrated the
willingness of the parties involved in the talks to seek mutually
acceptable solutions under difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her hope that the results of the negotiations
would lead to increased trust among the conflicting parties in the
Mideast, for mutual trust is needed not only in the final stage of
bargaining, but also in the process of implementing the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister also pointed out that it is important that
the conflicting parties do not take any actions that might hinder
the implementation of the just-concluded agreement, or disrupt the
on-going talks between the Palestinians and Israelis for lasting
peace in the Mideast.

CANBERRA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Organizing Committee
(SOCOG) and International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials met
with Australia's new Sports Minister Jackie Kelly on Saturday to
discuss the tax issues which could affect the financial situation
of the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Kelly said IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge and
several SOCOG members, who attended the talks in Sydney, had been
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
But she said the 2000 Olympic Games would not gain a total
exemption from a proposed goods and services tax (GST).
</P>
<P>
Kelly added SOCOG president Michael Knight's warning of a
potential 200 million Australian dollars budget blowout under a
GST were "exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
Rogge said he was satisfied the federal government had
acknowledged the IOC and SOCOG concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that if a GST was imposed on SOCOG, it would
be a substantial blowout of the budget and there is also a
complication for SOCOG in terms of bureaucracy and administration
involved so we would prefer, obviously, for SOCOG to be exempt in
one or another way from the GST," Rogge said.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Aid Bangladesh's Post-Flood Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
will approve some 130 million U.S. dollars as a credit for five
sectors of Bangladesh to help the country overcome the damage
caused by floods, media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement in this regard is expected to be signed by January
1999 after the ADB board meeting scheduled for December 17, which
will give approval for the credit, ADB official sources were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A 14-member ADB mission, headed by senior program officer Shyam
Bajpal, will submit its final report containing details about
sectoral allocation on November 26 for the ADB board's
consideration, they said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB mission paid a 12-day visit to this South Asian country
recently to assess the extent of the damage caused by the worst
floods in a century, which gripped about two-thirds of the country
for 10 weeks and seriously affected over 30 million people,
inflicting a preliminary estimated loss of 4.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ADB prefers to provide credit to five sectors which were
badly hit in the deluge, according to the mission's draft report.
</P>
<P>
The allocation in the five sectors include 63.3 million dollars
for road and rural infrastructure, 15 million dollars for
railways, 18.3 million dollars for water, 7 million dollars for
education and 24.6 million dollars for water supply sanitation and
urban development, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Of the total commitment, 100 million dollars will come as fresh
loan and the remaining 30 million dollars from the loan savings
from the on-going projects, they stated.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is trying to disburse the credit quickly on an
emergency basis because of the severe floods, a senior ADB
official said. Normally, the ADB authorities take at least two
years to process and give approval of a loan.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airline Flights Normal After Typhoon Babs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Operations of the Philippine
Airlines (PAL) returned to normal Saturday after two days of
disruptions caused by the supertyphoon Babs.
</P>
<P>
The company said all 22 PAL flights out of Manila scheduled for
 Saturday are expected to depart on time, and all return flights
to Manila are also expected to operate normally.
</P>
<P>
All 10 PAL aircraft used for domestic operations -- three
Airbus A330-300s, two A320s, four Boeing B737-300s and one Fokker
-- are accounted for and in top flying condition, it said.
</P>
<P>
Gale-force winds and heavy rains spawned by the supertyphoon
forced the cancellation of two PAL domestic flights Thursday and
six domestic flights Friday.
</P>
<P>
PAL serves 16 domestic destinations out of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Typhoon Babs, one of the strongest to hit the Philippines so
far this year, entered the country Wednesday and is reportedly
heading into the South China Sea now.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, Rebel Forces Fight in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops and
forces of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) were engaged in
a fierce fighting Friday in southwestern Mindanao, during which
two government soldiers and three rebels were killed, an official
report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine News Agency said that in Friday's
fighting between the two sides in the Datu Piang-Shariff
Agwak-Talayan complex in Maguindanao, southwestern Mindanao, two
government soldiers and three rebels were killed, and scores of
others from both sides were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the government and the MILF warned vehicles
plying the Cotabato-Sultan Kudarat portion of the highway to stop
using the route to avoid being caught in a possible spill-over of
the skirmishes along the stretch.
</P>
<P>
A government army spokesman said Saturday that four government
soldiers were wounded in the day-long encounter Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that military offensives will not stop unless the
rebels contain themselves inside Camp Omar, an MILF base situated
at the tri-boundaries of Datu Piang, Shariff Agwak and Talayan.
</P>
<P>
"We will give them up to 2:00 p.m. today and if they still
refuse to heed, we will continue our offensive," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, meanwhile, said that they will remain in their
positions and block any penetration that will be initiated by
government troops against Omar, according to the state-run agency.
</P>
<P>
"You see, the situation remains tense and anytime encounters
may again take place," said Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-chairman for
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that one MILF rebel was killed while three others were
wounded during Friday's encounter that nearly reached the town of
Shariff Agwak.
</P>
<P>
Murad stressed that MILF forces would only refrain from
resisting military offensives if their Camp Omar in the area is
assured of its safety.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention of making the highway as the center of
battle. We would just like to assure that the perimeter defense
line of our camp (Omar) would be well protected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said that a proposed informal meeting between
the two sides is set for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiators are expected to lay down the ground rules
for an immediate cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is fighting for independence of Mindanao after another
rebel group -- the Moro National Liberation Front -- signed an
agreement on peace in the Southern Philippines two years ago.

<P>
HANOI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister
Vu Khoan told Saturday's leading newspapers here that the China
visit by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai "gained fruitful results,
introducing a new stage of development between the two countries
in 1999".
</P>
<P>
Khai and his entourage returned here Friday from a five-day
official visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the results of the PM's visit to China, the deputy
foreign minister said the tour was within the framework of a
regular high-level meeting of Vietnam and China and also the first
visit by a Vietnamese prime minister since the two countries
normalized relations.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only a regular meeting of the two countries, but
also a preparatory step for the two countries' relations in the
next century," Khoan stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides affirmed their consistent policies to
promote a good-neighborly relationship and multi-faceted
cooperation as well as to expand cooperation frameworks.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese and Chinese leaders reaffirmed their determination
to strengthen economic and trade cooperation and boost negotiation
to sign bilateral agreement on land borders before 2000 and
agreement on delineation of the Tonkin (Beibu) Gulf in 2000 at the
latest, paving the way for the Vietnam-China ties to develop
towards the 3rd millennium, Khoan said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The two parties agreed that, if implemented, the
achievements would be an event of historic significance."
</P>
<P>
The two countries' leaders agreed to investigate effective
measures to bring trade turnover to at least 2 billion U.S.
dollars in 2000 as they focused discussions on this issue during
the visit, the senior diplomat said.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Meets Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Saturday met with visiting Japanese Deputy
Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura and discussed the current
situation in Cambodia and the political impasse on the formation
of a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and Machimura, who arrived in Cambodia Friday, met for
nearly two hours at Hun Sen's Takhmau residence.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's spokesman Prak Sokhon told reporters after the
meeting that Japan maintained that Cambodia's July election was
free and fair and expressed its regret over Cambodia's U.N. seat
vacancy after the election.
</P>
<P>
Machimura said although Japan hopes that Cambodia will form a
government soon, Japan will not interfere in Cambodia's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that the key to breaking the deadlock is on the
part of FUNCINPEC. He urged the friendly countries of Cambodia to
encourage the opposition lawmakers to return to the country to
seek the way to resolve the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said before the new government is formed, the current
government must continue to carry out its duty in order to prevent
the situation from getting worse. He said the King was very
unhappy about the current situation and said he would not call a
summit of the three major parties before they reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen believed that the Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) and FUNCINPEC have the ability to make the National Assembly
operate and have the new government formed.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen confirmed that the King will leave Phnom Penh for
Beijing after the Independent Day on November 9 to continue his
medical checkup. The King has agreed to keep in contact with the
current government when he is not at home.
</P>
<P>
Machimura arrived in Siem Reap on Friday for a three-day visit
to Cambodia and to attend the International Forum on Demining and
Victim Assistance to be held here on October 26-28.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok on Thursday, Machimura urged all parties in Cambodia
to resolve their differences speedily and warned that the delay of
the formation of the new government was hurting Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the July election this year and has a slim majority
in parliament, but opposition FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP) have protested that the ruling party used intimidation and
fraud to win. They have demanded concessions including the
presidency of the National Assembly in exchange for the two-thirds
majority vote needed to confirm a new government.

<HEADLINE> Bacteria Threatens Passion Fruit Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Passion fruit farming in
central Kenya is threatened by a devastating bacterial disease,
an agricultural official said.
</P>
<P>
James Muguima, an agricultural technician in the Nakuru
District, was quoted by Saturday's Daily Nation newspaper as
saying the bacteria, fusarium wilt, could not be controlled by
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The only remedy was planting resistant varieties obtained
through grafting the purple passion fruit to the yellow type, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The disease attacks a plant from the apex, gradually causing
even the roots to rot.
</P>
<P>
Muguima advised the farmers to use the yellow fruit as the
root stock in grafting.
</P>
<P>
He said that although this variety was rare in the area,
efforts were being made to ensure it was widely available next
year.
</P>
<P>
The officer said farmers could also plant seeds, which gave
the plant its full seven-year life span, unlike cuttings.
</P>
<P>
Seeds can be planted in a nursery and then transplanted or
directly sown in the field, he suggested.

prompt the revival of negotiations on the Israeli-Syrian and
Israeli-Lebanese tracks in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh also hoped that the agreement will help the
Palestinians deepen their relations with Jordan in various
fields, especially in the economic ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised "the extraordinary performance of the
Palestinian leadership in the negotiations" and the efforts made
by United States President Bill Clinton and King Hussein of
Jordan to help both sides reach the agreement.
</P>
<P>
After nine days of negotiations at the Wye Plantation near
Washington, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed the agreement at the White
House late Friday evening, which broke a 19-month deadlock of
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops from a
further 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three months, while
Palestinians will revoke anti-Israel clauses in their founding
charter.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been keeping a close eye on the Palestinian-
Israeli peace process. It maintains high-level contacts and good
relations with both sides in order to secure its national
interests.

<HEADLINE> Quelea Birds Invade Farms in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Quelea birds have invaded
wheat farms in Narok, the Rift Valley province of Kenya and
destroyed more than 4,800 hectares.
</P>
<P>
A report by the provincial director of agriculture, K.K.
Chepsaigut, said another 111 hectares were destroyed in Uasin
Gishu District and 1,400 hectares in Nakuru.
</P>
<P>
Narok has 48,000 hectares under wheat this year, Uasin Gishu
50,000 and Nakuru 13,000, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The quelea birds invaded the leading wheat-growing areas from
May, but the Ministry of Agriculture controlled them using aerial
spray, ground motorized-sprayers and blasting by means of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
The report added that small-scale farmers were the ones hurt
most.
</P>
<P>
Nakuru had the largest population of the birds in Kenya,
estimated at more than 11.6 million but about 67.8 percent were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Chepsaigut noted that the overwhelming invasion this year had
been precipitated by the availability of grass
</P>
<P>
The bird-hit areas are among major grain produced bases in
this east African country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges U.N. to Solve Refugee Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete has appealed to the international
community to find a solution to the problems of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Refugees have brought to Tanzania immense economic, social
security, environmental problems, said Kikwete at the 53rd U.N.
anniversary celebrations in Dar es Salaam Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete requested the international community to meet their
obligations in rendering assistance and search for a lasting
solution to the conflicts in the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also requested the U.N. to set up a
mechanism in easing the strain on the resources of the countries
which bore the brunt of hosting the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We also believe that the international community should
create a conducive environment and assume its proper
responsibility in protecting the refugees and facilitate their
ultimate repatriation," media reports Saturday quoted Kikwete as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the invaluable work done by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other
bodies in offering assistance to the refugees but at the same
time urged them to make greater efforts in creating requisite
conditions for repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania currently hosts more than 300,000 refugees from
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Somalia and
other countries, most of whom are sheltered at the camps in the
western regions of Kigoma and Kagera.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the situation in Burundi remained precarious
although warring parties have held three rounds of peace talks.
"We continue to get refugees from Burundi because the situation
is not stable."
</P>
<P>
The war-torn Congo (K) is another source of refugees, he said,
and appealed to the international community to help end
hostilities in the country.

<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes the agreement on
the second-phase withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank
and other issues, which was reached by the Palestinian Authority
and Israel after serious and frank negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Tang Guoqiang made this statement

</P>
<P>
In reply to a reporter's question, Tang said "we appreciate
efforts made to this end by the United States and other parties

</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China hopes that all the parties will
implement the agreement practically and affectively, so as to push
forward the peace process continuously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China sincerely hopes that the peace talks between
Israel and Syria and Lebanon will be resumed as early as possible
so that a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East region

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal Welcomed in Israel With Shrugs, Sneers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Men in the street here
reacted to the signing of the long-awaited Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement Friday night with indifference, skepticism, and
mostly, hopes.
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis didn't watch the live cast of the signing
ceremony of the deal in the White House because it has been in
Shabbat, the Jewish weekend during which people should not watch
TV under Jewish rules.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw its troops from a
further 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three months, while
Palestinians will revoke anti-Israel clauses in their founding
charter.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their opinions on the "land for security"
deal, some Israelis in west Jerusalem replied with "I don't know,"
"I don't want to talk about it," or simply a shrug.
</P>
<P>
In the mostly-Arab east Jerusalem, some Palestinians did not
think the Palestinian side had got a good deal and doubted whether
Israel would carry out the second withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel handed over too little land to the Palestinians, a taxi
driver said. Moreover, the troop redeployment would be carried out
by phases and that would be a problem, he said. This deal was "as
good as no deal," he added.
</P>
<P>
But most of the people interviewed expressed their hopes that
the agreement will bring peace to the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Fawas Sayed, a 37-year-old Palestinian who has worked in an
Israeli electricity company for 20 years, said most of the
Palestinians would support the agreement. "Without peace, there
will be mess and killings," he said.
</P>
<P>
A 24-year-old Palestinian said the agreement would be good for
both Israel and the Palestinians, albeit his belief that the deal
would be fairer to the Palestinians had Israel's former Labor
government been still in power.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian youngster who lost his job two months ago since
Israel imposed closure on Gaza and the West Bank and limited the
number of Palestinian workers in Jewish areas, hoped that the
closure would be less frequent after the singing of the agreement
and then "it would be easier for me to find a job."
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged Israeli who works for a taxi company believed
that the agreement would help reduce or prevent bloodshed and
terror attacks. "I think most Israelis will support it," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed the result of a recent Gallop poll
conducted in Israel which showed about 82 percent of the Israelis
support an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Mody Ebstein, a 27-year-old teacher living in Tel Aviv, was
more sober-minded than jubilant about the deal. He said in a
telephone interview that he was glad the deal was finally
reached, but the most important thing now is for the two sides to
expand trust.
</P>
<P>
"By restoring and strengthening mutual trust, it will be
easier for the agreement to be implemented," he said.

<HEADLINE> Non-Public Sector in Gansu Revitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of non-public
economic sector in northwest China's Gansu Province was higher
than the state-owned and township-run sectors in the first three
quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth of self-employed sector in Gansu soared 34
percent in the first three quarters, up 12 percent over
township-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Non-state-owned industrial firms yielded more than 4.4 billion
yuan (530 million US dollars) of added value in the first eight
months, 6.23 percent more than the state-owned industrial
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Acting Provincial Governor Song Zhaosu pledged his province
will create a still more favorable environment for the growth of
non-public economic sector in terms of political status,
management, service and guidance.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of non-public economic sector made up 21 percent in
Gansu's gross domestic product in 1997. It develops at an annual
pace of over 20 percent in the 1996-2000 period, according to a
provincial development plan.
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to attain the goal, Gansu Province has
simplified procedures in license issuance, reduced the range of
tax charges and build and expand more farm produce markets. As a
result, the registered capital of self-employed industrial and
commercial firms in the first six months this year was 27.8
percent more than the figure for the same period of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Strengthen Central Bank Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines moves to grant
its central bank more powers over commercial banks in a bid to
ensure loans to small borrowers from the agriculture sector, a
presidential news release said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The news release quoted Presidential Legislative Liaison Office
Secretary Jose Jaime Policarpio as saying President Joseph Estrada
would probably amend the central bank charter against abuses on
loans granted by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Policarpio said the amendment of the charter would lead to a
more equitable distribution of loans and help private sector
participate in the Estrada administration's centerpiece agenda of
food security and agricultural modernization.
</P>
<P>
"What the President wants is to make available the funds for
agriculture and augment them," Policarpio said. "As the President
had said, nobody will go hungry in the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
Despite a five-percent ceiling imposed on funds allotted for
commercial bank borrowers, bank directors and other officials
usually circumvent this rule because of their "interlapping
directorships" in other banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Estrada administration said that it would ask
Congress to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory powers of
the central bank to invigorate the banking sector and parry the
effects of the ongoing Asian economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Agrees to Co-Presidency of National Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Saturday said he agreed to the proposal of having
a co-presidency of the National Assembly, which would pave the way
for the operation of the new assembly and the formation of a new
government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks when he met with visiting Japanese
Deputy Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura, who arrived here
Friday to discuss the current situation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the idea was earlier put forward by a
FUNCINPEC representative at meetings last week. But it was
immediately denied by FUNCINPEC officials, saying their position
was still that the party should have the chairmanship for itself.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen insisted it depends on FUNCINPEC, but if there is a
co-presidency of the National Assembly, the Constitution must be
amended first.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen had earlier suggested that Prince Ranariddh, president
of FUNCINPEC, be appointed the supreme adviser to the government
or a co-president of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also reiterated his stance that the CPP's first choice
is to form a coalition with FUNCINPEC, because it need not change
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
If it was rejected by FUNCINPEC, he said, then FUNCINPEC should
agree to amend the Constitution to let the CPP to form a
government with simple majority or form a government with the Sam
Rainsy Party (SRP).
</P>
<P>
But so far, the two parties, which were at best loosely
associated before the election, have been united against their
common foe.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen insisted that the key to breaking the deadlock is on
the part of FUNCINPEC. He asked the friendly countries to urge the
opposition lawmakers to return to the country to seek the way to
resolve the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The CPP has won a slim majority in parliament, but the
opposition FUNCINPEC and SRP have protested that the ruling party
used intimidation and fraud to win. They have demanded concessions
including the presidency of the National Assembly in exchange for
the two-thirds majority vote needed to confirm a new government.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Calls for Good Governance, Human Rights on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Partnership should be forged
among state, business and society to achieve the goals of good
governance and human rights, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said here Saturday on the occasion of the 53rd United Nations Day.
</P>
<P>
"Good governance cannot be achieved unless all three enter into
an effective partnership. Only with good governance can social
responsibility be assured. And only with social responsibility can
our people ever hope to enjoy their full human rights," Chuan said
in his opening remarks to an international symposium on human
rights and business ethics.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was held at the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) center in Bangkok as
part of the commemoration of this year's United Nations Day and to
mark the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights on December 10.
</P>
<P>
As for Thailand, the prime minister said, the country had
realized the importance of good governance and it has been going
through the process of reforms, both politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
He referred to Thailand's new constitution, adopted in October
last year, as reflecting the fundamental principles enshrined in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
In a televised message on the occasion, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that the ongoing economic crisis
in different parts of the world had focused attention on the
concept of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out it was fruitless to argue against the
inevitability of globalization, Annan said the task ahead for the
world was to build on what was positive about the concept and take
care of vulnerable groups which are hardest hit by global crisis.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the issue of business ethics under the
circumstance of economic crisis in the region, Anand Panyarachun,
former Thai prime minister, called for more ethics in conduct of
business around the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that a unified code of ethics for business should be
realistic and practical, but unwavering in its principle.
</P>
<P>
Other guidelines that need to be followed are ensuring the
efficient administration of the code, making the code verifiable
and creating a sense of ownership and commitment of all
stockholders, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 representatives from various U.N. bodies in
Bangkok, Thai government and non-government organizations attended
the symposium, which marked the beginning of a week-long series of
events related to the U.N. Day.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Palestinian-Israeli Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has said the peace accord signed by Israel and the
Palestinians Friday is a step on the right path, the Al Ahram
daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Friday the agreement will enable the Palestinians
to recover territories on the West Bank and lead to final-status
talks pertaining to principal issues such as refugees, the status
of Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, signed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House,
Israel will pull back troops from an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank and will release several hundred jailed Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians on their part will step up crackdown on
alleged terrorists and revoke anti-Israel clauses in the
Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for sincere implementation of the agreement,
saying "real progress is bound to the sincerity of implementation
and the returning of land to Palestinian dominance."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that there is a long way to go to realize an
overall and durable peace in the Middle East, which cannot be
achieved without Israel's withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights and
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast War. The
peace talks between the two sides came to a halt early 1996 due to
disputes over the future of the heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985, allegedly to protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace
process was officially declared going ahead with the signing of an
interim peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in
Washington on Friday under the mediation of the United States and
the help from King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as well as U.S.
President Bill Clinton, after nine days of closed-door marathon
bargaining at the Wye Plantation Conference Center, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure from the United States and with a timely
reach-out from King Hussein, who came from a cancer treatment in
the U.S., the two sides finally had narrowed their tremendous gaps
and agreed at last to sign the historical document at the White
House Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The core of the achievement was Israel's further withdrawal
from the West Bank in exchange for firmer Palestinian commitment
to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel will withdraw troops from 13.1
percent of the West Bank land in three months while the
Palestinians will convene the Palestine National Council to revoke
anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
Also, Israel agreed to transfer 14.2 percent of the West Bank
territory now jointly policed by Israel and the Palestinian
Authority to Palestinian jurisdiction, and free 750 Palestinian
prisoners, allow the opening of an airport in Gaza and the safe
passage for Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, all sides highlighted the significance of the
accord which is believed to give a new push to the stalemated
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
As designed by the 1993 Oslo Agreement, it could be seen as a
major step toward a final settlement of the long-protracted
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said at the ceremony that "people around the world
should be heartened by this agreement," which will contribute to
the security and economic benefit of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who toughened the Israeli position after his
assumption of office in 1996, which was followed by a 19-month
impasse of the peace process, noted that with the accord, "people
are more secure" in the Middle East and it is an important moment
to secure a peaceful future for the Israeli and Palestinian
children alike.
</P>
<P>
Stating his commitment to security, Arafat said, "your security
is our security" and "We will never go back to violence and
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The accord restarted the engine of the peace process in the
region. This is a desire shared by both Israel and the
Palestinians as well as the United States. However, as the accord
itself came from tremendous and pain-taking efforts, its
implementation calls for more serious efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Also the Americans have vowed to continue their role in the
process. As experts here note that a sustained and direct U.S.
involvement will be needed to keep the accord on course and
ultimately gain a final peace treaty in the region.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams NATO Threat of Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic said on Friday that any possible military attack
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would not only
violate international laws, but also destabilize southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no ground for any pressure or any threat,
especially any military threat, against Yugoslavia as a sovereign
European country. These threats simply have no legal basis in
international law," Jovanovic said here in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Military attacks by NATO could only encourage "terrorist
activities" in Kosovo and "help those who are against peaceful
solution", he said, referring apparently to the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), the ethnic Albanian armed groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
He warned that NATO's military intervention could achieve
nothing positive, but would be damaging to Yugoslavia, to southern
Europe and to whole Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that Yugoslavia has fulfilled requirements of
the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Kosovo,
including the pullout of special police forces which, he said, are
now in their barracks.
</P>
<P>
"There are only regular police forces to maintain public law
and order" in Kosovo, he said, adding that if they were also
withdrawn, there would appear a security vacuum in no one's
interest.
</P>
<P>
He said that to the contrary of the reports by Western media,
the Yugoslav government is helping and guaranteeing the freedom
and safety of the refugees returning to Kosovo. A total of 100,000
refugees have returned while the government has set up 17 refugee
centers to distribute food, clothes, medicine and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
He complained that despite reports by humanitarian
organizations on positive developments in Kosovo, NATO was still
making preparation for military strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO and others are trying to launch a new rule in
international relations, the so-called right to humanitarian
intervention which is an expression of those who are for an
unipolar world," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO countries want to make a precedent out of the Kosovo
crisis "to have free hands to intervene militarily wherever they
wish in the world", Jovanovic said, adding that "this is of course
a big danger for the world order and for international relations".
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Western countries contradict
themselves on the issue of Kosovo. "They speak that they support
the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, but on the other side,
they are pressuring Yugoslavia, threatening it, even militarily,
when Yugoslavia wants to safeguard the territorial integrity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yugoslavia will maintain an independent foreign
policy despite pressures from Western countries which want it to
be obedient and to play by their rules.
</P>
<P>
While Yugoslavia wants to have normal relations with the United
States and other Western countries, "we still want to maintain
that we are an independent country, that we are not second-rate
country, that we should ask nobody how to arrange our home
affairs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia: Rugova's Reaction to Kosovo Agreement Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic Friday praised the ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova's welcome of the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement as a
positive sign toward the settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rugova said on Thursday that he welcomed the accord.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Jovanovic said that "we consider
it positive, and we think there should be a step forward to
continue unconditional dialogue in order to concretize the
political frameworks and the timetable" as spelled out in the
peace accord reached between Milosevic and the U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement has reaffirmed that Kosovo
will remain part of Yugoslavia and new local governments in the
the province will be elected in nine months.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the Yugoslav government is ready to
resume unconditional dialogues with the ethnic Albanians and hopes
that the negotiations will be kicked off soon.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the unconditional dialogue will be
resumed and the political framework which has been worked out and
publicly announced be respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister also ruled out the possibility
that the armed groups of ethnic Albanians, the so-called "Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA)," would take part in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Being a terrorist organization...they have no place in this,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Urges People to Find New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday called on the people to work together in finding
opportunities that would help end the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country needs active and optimistic attitudes from its
people, Habibie said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the second national meeting of the Association
of Indonesian Forwarders and Expediters here, the president
reassured the association that it will have great business
opportunities as the country's exports have been increasing.
</P>
<P>
"Exports have been increasing due to the weakening of our
purchasing power," he said, adding that if the association is able
to provide better and more effective services, they would gain the
confidence of consumers.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that banks have been consolidating
themselves to be able to provide capital to businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to remove these obstacles soon. In recent weeks, the
rupiah has been strengthening against the U.S. dollar," he said,
adding that this brings new hope to the country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian rupiah has been advancing significantly during the
past couple of weeks, closing at 7,700/7,900 to the U.S. dollar on
the Jakarta inter-bank spot market Friday. The currency was
hovering at a range of between 10,000 and 11,000 rupiah last
month.
</P>
<P>
If the rupiah stabilizes at a certain level against the U.S.
dollar, banks could gradually reduce their interest rates, Habibie
said, noting that this would make the wheel of the economy start
turning again.
</P>
<P>
Habibie further said that government efforts to restore the
country's economy could not be separated from the global
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The problems could not be easily predicted. Sometimes they are
very complex to handle as they depend on non-economic factors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic situation also plays a significant role. If
Indonesia succeeds in maintaining political stability,
international confidence would return and businessmen could resume
their activities, the president added.

<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A dusk to dawn curfew has been
imposed on the oil-producing Warri town in south Nigeria's Delta
State, after Thursday's ethnic clashes that had left about 35

KAMPALA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
expressed growing concern over the situation in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and called for a negotiated solution to
the conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the British High Commission here dated

He said British is taking action with other European Union

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Pays Much for Peace-keeping in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is paying
one million Rand (about 155,000 U.S. Dollars) a day for
maintaining peace-keeping troops in Lesotho, local daily Saturday
Star reported.
</P>
<P>
Several unidentified high-ranking officers of the South
African National Defense Force (SANDF) were quoted as saying that
there was dissatisfaction and concern within the SANDF, not only
over the lack of planning and unprofessional execution of the
Lesotho operation, but also over the budgetary implications of
the ongoing engagement.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that more than eight million Rand (about 1.36
million U.S. Dollars) a week is being spent on maintaining troops
in Lesotho, a senior officer said earlier this week, saying he
feared for the economic and political consequences of such a
drain on national finances.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Lesotho government, South Africa and
Botswana imposed a military intervention in Lesotho in
mid-September when the mountain kingdom fell into political and
social crisis resulting from the alleged May election fraud.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said while South African Deputy Defense Minister
Ronnie Kasrils was full of praise for the military intervention
in Lesotho, a large number of high-ranking SANDF officers
labeled the mission a failure.
</P>
<P>
Praising the actions of SANDF soldiers on the battlefield,
Kasrils said: "Lesotho was the first baptism of fire for the new
SANDF, and our men came out with shining colors."
</P>
<P>
But while many military personnel agreed with the explanation
given during briefings on Lesotho, an equal number has expressed
their unhappiness with the lack of planning, unreliable
intelligence and unprofessional execution of duties.
</P>
<P>
Some senior SANDF officers said the operation into Lesotho had
underestimated the reaction of Lesotho oppositions.

<HEADLINE> Computer-Short Tanzania Defers Issuing E. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has so far
failed to make a co-effort to issue the East African Passports to
traveling documents.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Immigration Department of the Ministry of
Home Affairs has said the passports, which provide their holders
with free travel among the three countries, will only be issued
after Tanzania acquires the capacity to process computerized data
like neighboring Kenya and Uganda, media reports here said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Chilambo, Public Relation Officer of the Immigration
Department, said some 180,000 East African Passports have been
issued to citizens of the East African Cooperation (EAC), a
regional organization consisting of the Kiswahili-speaking
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda with a total population of over 70
million.
</P>
<P>
Each country was given 60,000 passports while 40,000 more will
be issued to each before the end of this year in accordance with
the EAC strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our neighbors in Kenya and Uganda have already started using
the new passports. Tanzanians will have to wait until we acquire
the necessary facilities which cost some 300 million Tanzanian
Shillings," he said.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. Dollar can buy about 675 Tanzanian Shillings at
present exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Once the computer is in place, he said, his ministry will
issue the passports in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Each costs 7,000 Shillings for a valid period of five years
and can be renewed for another term with a payment of 3,500
Shillings.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry said the ministry is still not sure
of when the government will release the money but they maintained
that a request has already been placed with Treasury.
</P>
<P>
As part of a grand strategy, the EAC issues the common
passports to strengthen cooperation among its member countries.
It is also planning to launch a common currency.
</P>
<P>
In April, the three EAC member states approved a draft treaty
in a move to upgrade their cooperation into a treaty level to
help define in more clearer terms the shape and inclination of
the cooperation aimed at establishing a single market and
investment area in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The official signing ceremony of the treaty has been deferred
to July 1 next year to give the east Africans more time to
discuss the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on the basis of the defunct East African
Community which collapsed in 1977 due to reasons including the
divergence of economic policies then pursued by the member
states, the continued perception of disproportionate sharing of
benefits and lack of adequate compensation mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Since its renewal in 1996, the new EAC has tried to address
the shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives and
determined to place the new regional integration on a sustainable
basis.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Release All Suspects Awaiting Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
release all suspects awaiting trial for offenses in line with the
human rights posture of the present administration, a minister
has said.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express Saturda quoted Minister of Internal Affairs
Musa Yakubu as saying in Calabar, Cross Rivers State, that
persons arrested for smuggling wheat flour and related offenses
would soon regain their freedom.
</P>
<P>
After visiting some prisons in the country, he said, he had
discovered to his chagrin that some inmates who have no more
cases to answer were still detained.
</P>
<P>
The minister alleged that Nigerian prisons no longer harbor
detainees but those convicted, adding there are more than 50,000
prisoners in all the 174 prisons in this west African country.
</P>
<P>
In line with the on-going modernization and rehabilitation of
prisons, Yakubu said, all prisons built of palm leaves or mud
walls are to be demolished and reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
It will cost the Nigerian government 18 billion Naira (about
200 million U.S. Dollars) to rehabilitate prisons to the minimum
standards required by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar approved 100 Naira (about 1.1 Dollars) daily feeding
allowance for each prisoner while the current feeding allowance
is 50 Naira (about 0.55 Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Poverty Blamed for Conflicts in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Jakaya Kikwete has stressed that Africa's conflicts can
be explained by poverty.
</P>
<P>
The persistence of poverty prevented the attainment of peace,
security and development in many African countries, Kikwete said
Friday at a ceremony here in Dar es Salaam to mark the 53rd
anniversary of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tanzania agrees to the U.N. Secretary General's
views that only when prosperity becomes real will Africa have a
genuine and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The African continent is haunted by the absence of peace and
security because of constant conflicts, which were aggravated by
poverty, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, according to press reports Saturday,
also called for international support to ensure that sustainable
peace exist in Africa, especially in countries like Angola,
Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Africa needs complimentary support from the developed North
and developing countries, he said. "Sustainable economic growth
and recovery in Africa, will, in the end, benefit the North as
well," he added.

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Returning from a visit to a
Chinese prison Thursday, a British member of parliament praised
China's system of reform rather than punishment.
</P>
<P>
Together with a dozen other international human rights experts
and scholars, Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour Party member of the House of
Commons visited Beijing's No. 1 Prison in the southern suburbs of
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy to see the prison rewarding prisoners for
their good behavior, instead of punishing them for bad behavior,"
said Corbyn.
</P>
<P>
The British human rights expert, who is in charge of a human
rights commission in his parliament, has visited a dozen prisons
throughout the world. He said he was impressed by the management
in the Chinese prison.
</P>
<P>
Yang Di, the prison's head warden, told the visitors that local
courts will reduce the sentence of half of the prisoners there;
the best-behaved ones could serve only half of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
Corbyn said that he believes that the Chinese prison system is
the most effective in the field.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 2,000 male criminals incarcerated in the
440,000-sq-m Beijing No. 1 Prison.

<P>
Since its establishment in 1982, the prison has never had a
case of rioting or abnormal death.
</P>
<P>
Although it is more like a garden than a detention center, the
prison is totally isolated from the outside world by three
successive iron gates.
</P>
<P>
The inmates are encouraged to indulge in artistic pursuits. A
1,581-m whitewashed wall is covered in murals painted by them.
Yang said that any prisoner who shows an interest in art can
receive special training inside the prison.
</P>
<P>
"It's almost an arts academy," Corbyn said, commenting that
most prisons throughout the world are ``universities of crime,''
but Chinese prison managers help criminals to remold their
temperaments.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than three percent of the prison's inmates repeat their
offences, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by Wang Mingdi, vice-president of the China
Prison Society, show that only six to eight percent of Chinese
prisoners are repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
Inmates of the Beijing No. 1 Prison may lodge complaints about
their treatment in special boxes, Yang told the visitors.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Polio Campaign Ended in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- This year's anti-polio campaign
has been successfully concluded in Mozambique with over three
million childrens under five years inoculated.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Friday by Mozambican Health Minister
Aurelio Zilhao, according to the Noticias newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination rate has been 111.9 percent, he said,
explaining that children from neighboring countries in the border
area were also covered.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the successful results to the joint efforts by
government institutions, the business sector, domestic and
international non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The campaign which started in August and ended on October 2
cost about one million U.S. Dollars, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zilhao called for further support by people from all walks of
life in the vaccination campaign next year so as to completely
eliminate the disease in this southern African country by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Four polio cases were discovered in Mozambique last year, with
one in Cabo Delgado Province in the north, and the other three in
Zambezia Province in central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Despite its downward trend, the health authorities warned
people not to treat it lightly. For they said there is still the
possibility for the spread of the disease if there is any carrier
of the polio virus.

<HEADLINE> 10 More Arrested for Illegal Assembly in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Police arrested 10 people
who ignored orders to disperse during an illegal rally here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The police fired water cannons four times at a crowd of about
500 people, mostly youths, when they refused to heed the orders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, six people were arrested by police for taking part
in an unlawful assembly here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four persons including a law student were charged in
court here Saturday with failing to heed police orders to disperse
during an unlawful assembly here on October 17, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Now Northwest's Aquatic Food Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region has emerged as a major production base and distribution
center for aquatic products in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Ningxia turned out 22.3 million kg of aquatic
products, over 60 percent of which were sold in surrounding
provinces and autonomous regions, according to sources at the
regional government bureau in charge of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, located on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, has
a population of 4.95 million, 33 percent of whom are Hui
(Moslem) people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the regional government has encouraged local
farmers to develop aquatic production, a sector long neglected,
bringing the number of people involved in this industry to about
40,000 and the total aquatic-farming area to 10,666 ha.
</P>
<P>
The region, rich in sunlight resources, has
set up hothouses to breed some 20 kinds of aquatic products
including carp, shrimps and crabs.
</P>
<P>
A number of fishing cooperatives have been established to
coordinate the breeding, processing and marketing of aquatic
products.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Saturday
reiterated its claim that Singapore Air Force aircraft had on
several occasions intruded into Malaysian airspace since September
18 when restrictions on use of its airspace were imposed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar reiterated
Malaysia's stand after Singapore's Defense Ministry in s
statement Saturday made a point-to-point rebuttal of Malaysian
Defense Ministry's statements on the intrusions.
</P>
<P>
"We never pluck any defense statements from the sky," Syed
Hamid was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said his ministry's statements were based on facts.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the Defense Ministry is concerned, we have made our
statement and we stay by what we have said. The Singapore Defense
Ministry has the right to say what it wants," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia imposed restrictions on September 18 on the use of its
airspace by Singapore Air Force aircraft. Singapore has to obtain
prior clearance from Malaysian authorities for using Malaysia's
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid expressed the hope that this episode of allegations
and counter allegation would stop.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams NATO's Threat of Military Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There is absolutely no ground for any pressure or any
threat, especially any military threat against Yugoslavia as a
sovereign European country. These threats simply have no legal
basis in international law," Jovanovic said here in an interview
with Xinhua correspondents.
</P>
<P>
Military attacks by NATO would only encourage "terrorist
activities" in Kosovo and "help those who are against a peaceful
solution," he said in a reference to the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA), an ethnic Albanian armed group.
</P>
<P>
He warned that NATO's military intervention could achieve
nothing positive, but would be damaging to Yugoslavia, to the
region of southern Europe, and to all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said Yugoslavia has fulfilled UN Security Council
resolutions on Kosovo, including the pullout of special police
forces.
</P>
<P>
"There is only the regular police force remaining to keep
public law and order" in Kosovo, he said, adding that if they were
also withdrawn, a security vacuum might occur which would be in no
one's interest.
</P>
<P>
Contrasting with Western reports, he reaffirmed that the
Yugoslav government is helping and guaranteeing the freedom and
safety of the Kosovo refugees in their repatriation process. As a
result, 100,000 refugees have returned back and the government has
set up 17 refugee centers to distribute food, clothing, medicine
and construction materials.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite reports by humanitarian organizations on
positive developments in Kosovo, NATO was still preparing a
military strike against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO and others are trying to launch a new rule in
international relations, the so-called right to humanitarian
intervention which is an expression of those who are for a
unipolar world," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
NATO countries want to establish a precedent with the Kosovo
crisis in order to "have free hands to intervene militarily
wherever they wish in the world," Jovanovic said, adding that this
is a "big danger for the world order and for international
relations."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Western countries contradict
themselves on the issue of Kosovo. "They say they support the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, but on the other side, they
are pressuring Yugoslavia, threatening it, even militarily, when
Yugoslavia wants only to safeguard their territorial integrity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will maintain an independent foreign policy despite
pressures from Western countries which want it to be obedient and
play by their rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
While Yugoslavia wants to have normal relations with the United
Sates and other Western countries, "we still want to maintain that
we are an independent country, that we are not a second-rate
country, and that we should ask nobody how to arrange our home
affairs," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to launch a third town infrastructure development project
with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
The ADB will provide 80 percent of the 60-million-U.S.-dollar
project, and it is likely to give approval of credit for
disbursement at its board meeting sometime in 1999, the official
BSS news agency Saturday quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both the Bangladeshi government and the ADB have already agreed
in principle to launch the project on the basis of a report
submitted by the consultants and a total of 22 towns will be
brought under the development.
</P>
<P>
The primary objective of the project is human development, and
the investment will be used in the sector of water supply
environmental sanitation including drainage, public and private
latrines, solid waste management, slum improvements and
institutional development aimed at improving the quality of life
in the towns.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has already financed the second town infrastructure
development project for the improvement of 21 towns. The work on
the project began on April 1996, and it would be completed by the
year 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) deported an American citizen for spying
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jim-Kyung was accused of spying for South Korea's National
Security Planning Ministry, Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Kim came to DPRK many times after
accepting missions from South Korea's highest authority and the
National Security Planning Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kim allegedly tried to ``corrupt from within DPRK's
socialist system so that DPRK could be assimilated by South
Korea,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Kim reportedly confessed his espionage. He also admitted that
his activities violated DPRK's sovereignty. The report said
he should be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang However decided to deal with Kim leniently,
considering his American identity and American-DPRK
relations.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that DPRK will remain alert to
attempts to overthrow the country's socialist system.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government-drafted
program dealing with the economic crisis in the country is nearly
complete, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The program is a "very thorough document," which lays out
immediate anti-crisis measures and strategic goals, Primakov told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The program, prepared by a commission led by First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov, was examined by ministers, scientists and
experts.
</P>
<P>
The program, which will be submitted to the International
Monetary Fund(IMF), will be discussed on Monday at a governmental
meeting attended by deputy prime ministers and ministers, and will
be finalized within a week, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov emphasized that ``the Russian government should be
seen as a single team, Ministers seldom get an impulse to act for
their parties, let alone directives. They all work in the
government not as politicians, but as professionals."
</P>
<P>
There will be no famine in the country this winter, he added.
``Food import has started to increase,'' he added.

<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will arrive here Saturday evening to brief Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak about the latest Palestinian-Israeli summit in the
U.S. and the resulting West Bank accord.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoting
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zohdy al Aidra as saying.
</P>

areas will be opened.
</P>
<P>
Al Aidra said Arafat is keen on making Cairo the first stop in
the Arab world to explain the agreement in view of the
Egyptian-Palestinian relations with a special nature.

<P>
Arafat appreciates the key and basic role Egypt plays in the
Middle East peace process, al Aidra said.

<HEADLINE> Hewitt to Take on Nestor at HK Open Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Daniel Nestor
reached his third straight Challenger final when he crushed aside
fellow left-hander and seventh seed Michael Tebbutt 6-3, 6-4 in
the semi-finals at the CMG Asia Hong Kong Open challenger tennis t
ournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel, who had won two Challenger events last month, downed
Tebbutt 6-3, 6-4 in 62 minutes on Saturday. Tebbutt, the seventh
seed at the tournament, ousted top seed Indian Leander Paes 6-3,
6-3 in the quarter-finals on Friday to produce the tournament's
biggest upset.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Canadian will in the title clash on Sunday
take on Australia's eighth seed Lleyton Hewitt who made it to the
last two by downing unseeded American Cecil Mamiit 6-0, 6-3 in 61
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The championship match is expected to be one of contrast
between Nestor's serve-and-volley game and the quick movement and
flashy returns by Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
Nestor's service at a rate of 70 percent made the big
difference against Tebbutt. The Canadian was able to put
pressure on his opponent. Nestor broke service in the second
game of the match and held that advantage to win the set.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian opened up a 5-2 lead in the second set but
Tebbutt was getting very frustrated with the poor way of his
game. When attempting at 5-2 to take a swipe at the court, his
racquet flew out of his hand and landed halfway up the stands.
Tebbutt was warned for unsportsmanlike conduct as the racquet
almost hit someone, for which he would have been automatically
defaulted.
</P>
<P>
"That's not something I do and I feel pretty embarrassed about
what happened," he said. "I did apologize to the person the
racquet just missed and I gave her a racquet as a gesture of my
apology," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tebbutt admitted that Daniel played well while he himself
failed to make his opponent work on court. And his eight double
faults cost him badly.
</P>
<P>
Nestor dropped serve in the eighth game but then served for
the match again in the ninth game and made no mistakes this time.
</P>
<P>
"Michael didn't play as well as I know he can and I am really
happy to be in another final. My game was working for me and I
was able to remain focused throughout the match," said Nestor.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: UK's Economy Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) - Economic growth in Britain made
an unexpected turn in the third quarter of the year, dashing
business hopes of a larger cut in interest rates next month.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter
compared with the previous quarter, according to the latest
figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
That was the same rate as the second quarter. On an annual
basis, the economy grew 2.5 percent, the level normally seen by
economists as its long-term trend growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said all economic sectors enjoyed an increase during the
quarter including the struggling manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
The service sector also grew more robustly than expected with a
gain of 0.6 percent, the same as in the previous quarter, the ONS
added.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the city commonly believe the figures will be
crucial to interest rate deliberations for the Bank of England's
Monetary Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
Shares slipped slightly Friday on the news and the pound was
stronger as the City took the view that the unexpected
growth may make the committee think a little harder before cutting
interest rates again in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The persistence of economic growth continues to surprise
economists, who are mostly forecasting a bumpy landing of the
economy next year.
</P>
<P>
UK economist Adam Cole said, "The figures failed to show the
widely expected slowdown in growth. Activity continues to be
driven by services output, where growth has slowed but by far less
than industry."
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, "The lead indicators of GDP, such as the CBI
Industrial Trends survey, all point to a much more pronounced
slowdown," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shadow chancellor Francis Maude, speaking to BBC Radio shortly
before the figures were released, said previous Treasury figures
had already suggested the UK was "sliding towards recession."
</P>
<P>
He said the government should ditch "crazy plans to increase
costs on business" such as the minimum wage and implementation of
the European Working Time Directive.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth figures were seized on by Stephen Byers,
chief secretary to the treasury. He said, "Today we have real
figures for output of the whole economy, not surveys or forecasts."
</P>
<P>
"They show the economy continuing to expand, with growth across
all the main sectors," he added.
</P>
<P>
A big question mark now over Britain's economy is how much it
will be hit by the global financial turmoil, that has already
gripped developing regions and threatened the West.
</P>
<P>
Over recent months, governments and economic agencies around
the world have slashed their 1998 and 1999 forecasts for economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The consensus is that the UK and western industrial countries
will see the worst next year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Mideast Peace Deal Requires More Courage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday that keeping the Middle East peace process on track
will require continued courage by Israelis and Palestinians
following the signing of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"It (the agreement) strengthens security, increases cooperation
against terrorism, and brings both sides closer to the day when
they can live together as free people," said Clinton in his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed an agreement here Friday, with Israel
pledging to withdraw troops from more West Bank land and Palestine
committing further Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping the peace process on track will require continued
courage by Israelis and Palestinians in the months ahead," said
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"But this agreement shows what is possible when the will for
peace is strong, and I am proud that together we are able to make
real progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton promised that his administration will
continue its effort in pushing forward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"America will continue to work for a just and lasting peace in
this land that is holy for so many people throughout the world,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The land-for-peace interim accord was signed shortly after 5:30
p.m. (2130 GMT) at the end of a ceremony held in the East Room of
the White House. Clinton signed as witness and King Hussein of
Jordan also participated the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
All of them highlighted the importance of the accord which came
after nine days of hard talks.
</P>
<P>
"People around the world should be heartened by this agreement
today," which would contribute to the security and economic
benefit of the people in the Middle East, said Clinton at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israelis will withdraw from 13.1 percent
of the West Bank in three months, Palestinians will convene the
Palestine National Council to revoke anti-Israel clauses in the
Palestinian National Charter.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to transfer 14.2 percent of Israel
and Palestine jointly-controlled West Bank land to Palestinian
control, and Israel will release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three phases, allow the opening of the Palestinian airport in
Gaza, safe passage for Palestinians from Gaza to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel also committed to a third withdrawal from the West Bank,
but the timing and size need to be decided in further talks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was achieved under the U.S. mediation and the
help from King Hussein, who was in the United States for cancer
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches National Fire Safety Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Saturday night
launched a National Fire Safety Campaign to inform and remind the
public of ways to protect homes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics put together by the Singapore Civil Defense Force
show that there were over 2,500 home fires in the city of 3
million people in the first eight months this year, leaving five
people dead.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that 86 percent of home fires, which
amounted to 60 percent of all fires across the country, occurred
in the public housing estates.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, half the 2,215 housing estate
fires were caused by people who carelessly disposed buts of
cigarettes, matches, or embers in rubbish chutes and one sixth of
such fires were caused by residents who left cooking stoves
unattended.
</P>
<P>
The National Fire Prevention Council pointed out that most of
these fires could have been prevented if the public understood how
easily fires can start.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that ignorance, complacency and carelessness
contributed to unnecessary fires.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Emphasizes on United Nations' Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has said that there is
no organization in the world better suited to promoting economic
and social progress than the United Nations (U.N.).
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council Senior General Than Shwe in his message,
which was read by Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw at a
ceremony to commemorate the 53rd anniversary of the U.N. day here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The message said it is crucially important for the nations of
the world to follow the path of sustainable development, adding
that the prospect for sustainable development in today's world has
been affected not only by the current economic crisis facing a
number of countries, but also by the rapid and continuous
degradation and dwindling of the natural resource base around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
In regard of human rights, the message said: "we are of the
view that accepted norms of human rights should be promoted
through cooperation and consensus building."
</P>
<P>
"Our concept of human rights is based on our own values,
traditions and cultures. We believe that the right to development,
the right to decent food, clothing and shelter, the right to live
peacefully and in security are of paramount importance for the
developing countries like Myanmar," it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been a U.N. member since April 1948.
