ALL EYES ON HUNDLEY FOR OPENING DAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For the first time since 1992, a Los Angeles
Dodgers catcher not named Mike Piazza will be in the starting
lineup opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson is praying the new name is Todd Hundley. With the
season opener two days away, Johnson said he will be watching
Hundley as he watches no other player during the final two
exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think about anything else,'' Johnson said before the
Dodgers played the Anaheim Angels in the annual Freeway Series.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, acquired in a trade with the Mets on Dec. 1, has a
surgically repaired right elbow. The question all spring has been
his ability to throw.
</P>
<P>
   Those doubts may have been alleviated Friday during batting
practice, when Hundley playfully took grounders at shortstop and
threw around the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a big grin on his face all day,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will wait until the end of the weekend to
determine if the Dodgers will carry three catchers. Hundley, rookie
Paul LoDuca and journeyman Rick Wilkins all made the trip west from
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been any pessimism about Hundley's bat. He set a
major-league single-season record with 41 homers in 1996 with the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But he only had 18 at-bats in Florida. Hundley batted in the
No.2 spot Friday night and went 3 for 4 with an infield single and
bloop single.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled outfield: The catching position isn't Johnson's only
weekend decision. The race between Jacob Brumfield and Trenidad
Hubbard for the fifth outfielder spot is going down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield, a 33-year-old non-roster invitee, batted .283 with
two homers and six RBI in 18 spring games. Hubbard, 32, was the
Dodgers' opening-day center fielder last year, and was the only
player in that lineup who wasn't traded or lost for the season to
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard's luck ran out on March 8 in Vero Beach, when he
collided with Hiram Bocachica. Hubbard played in only 12 games and
batted .130 (3 for 23).
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Brumfield,'' Johnson said. ``He's had a good spring. He
wasn't even in the picture at the beginning. Hubbard was really set
back with the collision. We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you listening?: Johnson's penchant is motivating talented
teams with eclectic personalities. That's why he said he admires
the New York Yankees, who tonight make their first appearance in
Dodger Stadium since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following as a subtle warning for his own players:
</P>
<P>
   `The thing I like about the Yankees is there are a lot of stars
on that club but none of them are selfish,'' he said. ``None of
them complained (last year) about playing time or anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez will start for the Dodgers tonight. David Cone will
start for the Yankees. The first pitch is scheduled for 7:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie award: Left-handed relief pitcher Onan Masaoka was named
the top rookie during spring training. Masaoka, 21, allowed only
one earned run and struck out 11 in seven appearances.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nine days of hesitation, NATO attacked the
center of Yugoslavia's capital, destroying the headquarters of the
security forces carrying out President Slobodan Milosevic's
offensive against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of seven cruise missiles _ fired from American
warships in the Adriatic _ struck just before 1 a.m. Saturday in
Belgrade, the officials said. A British submarine, the Splendid,
fired an eighth cruise missile at another target outside Belgrade,
they said, declining to specify where.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon refused Friday night to disclose the targets hit,
but flames raged from two buildings near the Sava River in
Belgrade's core, the federal Ministry for Internal Affairs and the
Ministry of the Interior. The buildings house the headquarters of
the paramilitary police forces that have carried out Milosevic's
yearlong crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 10 days of attacks that NATO had struck
the center of Belgrade, a once-thriving capital that has slowly
withered under years of economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation
caused by Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Although previous attacks battered military targets on
Belgrade's edges, the missiles Friday night struck with a
thunderous clap that shook the entire capital. Within minutes of
the first explosion, an enormous arc of flames soared hundreds of
feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of casualties from the strikes was not immediately
clear, but the attack occurred in the middle of the night, at a
time when the buildings would presumably have few people in them.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings are close to other government buildings,
including a hospital. But it appeared that the cruise missiles _
each with a 1,000-pound warhead _ struck their targets with
pinpoint precision, leaving other buildings nearby still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, Vuk Draskovic,
said there were ``many, many victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Militarily and psychologically, the strikes were the first firm
evidence that NATO was carrying out the warning by its commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, that there would be ``no sanctuary'' for
Yugoslavia's political and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week NATO gave Clark the authority to expand the
raids beyond strictly military targets in or near Kosovo. On
Thursday American F-15s destroyed a bridge over the Danube River in
the city of Novi Sad, and Pentagon and NATO officials have vowed
that more bridges and other targets in cities would be pounded as
long as Milosevic continued his repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The targets of this phase of NATO's campaign _ first the bridge,
then the two ministry buildings _ are being deliberately chosen and
timed to maximize their psychological impact and to leave the
Yugoslav authorities uncertain of when and where the next strike
will be, a senior administration official said. The official said
other buildings, like the Ministry of Defense, were on the target
list.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's strikes came after nine days of bombing had made
little progress in slowing Milosevic's onslaught against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Refugees continued to pour from Kosovo into
Albania and Macedonia, telling of killings and forced expulsions
from villages, towns and cities throughout the province.
</P>
<P>
   The mushrooming refugee crisis along Kosovo's border _ where
hundreds of thousands of refugees have gathered, short of food and
shelter _ has put new pressure on the United States and NATO to
intensify its campaign, even if that meant considering the use of
ground troops. While NATO officials have discussed the possibility
of NATO troops' escorting ethnic Albanians back to Kosovo and
protecting a self-governing enclave there, those plans are
preliminary, and senior officials here in Washington said the
administration continued to adamantly oppose any proposal to use
ground troops in combat in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, facing sharp questions at a White House news
briefing, appealed for patience and expressed confidence that an
air campaign alone would be able to achieve NATO's military and
political objectives in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be determined,'' Clinton said. ``We must be
persistent. We must be patient if we expect to see this mission
through. And I am absolutely determined to do that. We have to make
sure that Milosevic pays a heavy price for this policy of
repression. We have to seriously diminish his capacity to maintain
that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign has been severely hampered by the Balkan
weather, with rain, low clouds and fog forcing many warplanes to
abandon their targets. Through the first nine nights, alliance
aircraft flew some 2,700 missions over or near Yugoslavia, 405 of
them combat strikes. The Pentagon estimated that 20 percent of the
missions had been scrubbed because of foul weather, but other
officials have said the number was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a number of NATO warplanes _ including F-16s and
F-15s _ took advantage of a brief break in the rainy weather to
launch the first daylight air raids against Yugoslav forces. The
jets attacked ground forces operating near the center of Kosovo,
NATO and Pentagon officials said, declining to identify what was
struck.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, however, clouds and rain once again blanketed the
region, forcing frustrated NATO commanders to limit their attacks
to weapons unaffected by weather, including the Tomahawk cruise
missiles that struck Belgrade Friday night. Forecasts predict that
the weather will clear over the weekend, and when it does,
officials at NATO and the Pentagon said, the raids will increase in
scope and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's headquarters in Brussels, officials said the brunt of
the raids occurring now are falling on ground forces directly
involved in the campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. A
military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby of Britain, described
a series of strikes against military targets on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   One strike hit what he described as a support base for
Yugoslavia's 243rd Mechanized Brigade, which is now operating in
the Pagarusa Valley, where thousands of Albanians have reportedly
been surrounded by Yugoslav forces and repeatedly shelled. The
Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said American B-1 bombers,
joining the attacks for the first time, had also bombed a staging
area for armored forces in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those attacks, the Yugoslav forces have continued to
press their offensive in the Pagarusa Valley and near Malisevo, a
city west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, that is the last
stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence reports collected here in Washington suggest that
Milosevic's forces have largely routed the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, but Wilby said Friday that the rebels remained a
viable force.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials also reported that the Yugoslav forces
were being slowed, if not stopped, by the cumulative effects of
NATO's raids, particularly the destruction of fuel and ammunition
depots. Wilby said one Yugoslav unit, the 549th motorized brigade,
had been ``immobilized'' near Djakovica while waiting for more
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``therefore, NATO air-to-ground operations against
fielded forces in Kosovo are already degrading and disrupting'' the
Yugoslav military's ability to use tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missile strikes against fuel storage sites in Prokuplje
on Wednesday and at Leskovac and Pristina on Thursday destroyed an
estimated 35 percent of Yugoslavia's entire supply of fuel, a
senior Pentagon official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said the attacks were taking a toll on
Yugoslav morale, too, though he offered little evidence to back
that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly are having some impact on command and control,'' he
said. ``We're seeing some morale problems in the army. The forces
are clearly more wary of being hit. They've had to disperse more
and are having a harder time operating in large, coherent units.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged the limits of the success. ``We have
not seen tanks stopped in their tracks, if that's what you mean,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs of some progress, officials have pressed for new
weapons that would allow NATO to intensify the attacks on the
ground forces. Clark has asked Secretary of Defense William Cohen
to approve the use of Apache helicopter gunships _ used to attack
tanks _ and long-range rocket batteries to support them.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Cohen had not yet made a decision on the request. The
helicopters would require large numbers of Army troops to move into
the region _ 300 soldiers for a battalion of 18 helicopters _ and
that has raised fears that it would amount to an introduction of
American ground forces into the Balkans. The Clinton administration
has repeatedly ruled that out.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of bombing Belgrade was so great that Clinton
himself approved the target list earlier this week and authorized
the attack itself within the last 24 hours, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and other NATO planners chose the targets each day, but
because of the possibility of substantial civilian loss of the
life, aides sought Clinton's specific approval for the attack on
the two ministries Friday.

THE IRA'S OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British and Irish prime ministers have given the Irish
Republican Army an opportunity to chart a new course for its
nationalist cause. The IRA should give up some of its weapons to
make the case politically for a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has rejected previous demands that it give up, or
``decommission,'' its weapons as tantamount to surrender. But not
even the most rabidly anti-IRA Unionist in Northern Ireland expects
every last rifle to go on the scrapheap immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum on the agreement last May and Assembly elections
in June have exposed fissures in Unionism. David Trimble, the
pro-agreement Unionist who would become chief minister in the new
government, needs a gesture on decommissioning to maintain control
of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, the British and Irish prime
ministers, were unable to broker a compromise this week. However,
they did devise an arrangement under which some weapons would be
put ``beyond voluntary use'' during a day of reconciliation
featuring ceremonies of remembrance for all victims of violence. An
international commission would verify IRA compliance. There would
be no surrender here; only a symbolic renunciation of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA and its political adjunct, Sinn Fein, have until April
13 to accept this offer, which will no doubt be met by objections
that the IRA needs arms to defend Catholics from Protestant mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Communal violence of this magnitude has not been a problem in
Northern Ireland for years. IRA guns were powerless to protect the
lawyer Rosemary Nelson and other Catholic nationalists from
carefully planned assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   With the slow separation of Scotland, Great Britain is on the
verge of extraordinary constitutional change. The Irish Republic,
no longer the sectarian backwater of Unionist caricature, is the
most dynamic economy in Europe. Northern Ireland itself has
renounced the bigoted policies that kept Catholics down for
hundreds of years. The IRA should not be bound by the strictures of
the past when the future holds great opportunities.

THE KNOWING NO

<TEXT>
<P>
   The duke and duchess of Northumberland make welcome headlines in
a permissive world. Fearing that their teenage son would go the way
of many a dissolute earl who inherited too much money too young,
they got a court order to postpone his coming of age.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of acquiring his $1.6 million fortune and additional
annual allowance of $400,000 at age 18 as stipulated in a trust set
up by a deceased uncle, the 14-year-old boy will now have to wait
until he is 25 to be independently wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   People long out of their 20s might suggest age 40 or beyond as
the threshold of maturity, but the duke and duchess still get
credit for a courageous ``no'' _ a word too many American parents
have forgotten how to use, mainly because it's a lot harder to say
than ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh to have the Northumberlands in the grocery store pushing the
cart with the brat in the seat. The tantrum for candy might never
take place, or it would stop in midscreech, because ``No, not until
you've had dinner'' would mean exactly that. Instead, what it
usually means is eventual capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true as the child grows older and makes bigger
demands for the most expensive fad toy, the designer wardrobe, the
car, the credit card, the private phone line, the unchaperoned trip
with a boyfriend or girlfriend. Instead of enforcing household law,
parents duck the role of the heavy in favor of being a pal. Or they
shrug and say, ``Kids grow up a lot faster than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't _ societal pressure just makes young people think
they've grown up. They need, and often secretly want, to hear a
firm older voice say, ``Wait a few years on that.''
</P>
<P>
   So much of life is geared to instant gratification. ``Just do
it,'' the shoe advertisement tells us. Like most commercials, it
promotes the invincibility of youth.
</P>
<P>
   But youth is quite fragile, much like a greenhouse plant getting
its first taste of the elements. A watchful gardener gives it room
to grow without letting it go wild.

A MACRO PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the computer virus Melissa tore through cyberspace _ a
reminder that the trick with viruses is learning to live with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, virus authors would always be caught, as 30-year-old
David Smith, the alleged author of Melissa, was. But this kind of
tracking can be difficult and could pose privacy threats. Even
electronic identification numbers _ such as those recently found to
be generated by some Microsoft products _ leave questionable clues.
That's because the numbers can be fudged, explains Richard Smith,
the software company president who discovered the Microsoft
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This makes awareness essential.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa is a macro virus. Macros carry a series of commands that
can be grouped together into one command, so one keystroke, for
example, could save a document and send it to another user. Macro
viruses contain malicious commands that destroy data or interfere
with how software runs.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace training could help. Employers should do better at
training employees on computer basics as well as antivirus software
and techniques. But education has limits. Training can be seen as a
time-consuming luxury. Sometimes it's a grass-roots effort that
spreads slowly.
</P>
<P>
   This puts Microsoft on the line. The company has improved
software security. It works with companies that produce antivirus
software. And recent versions of its software alert users when they
are about to open a document that has macros, some of which might
be viruses. Users can then choose to disable the macros.
</P>
<P>
   Some have asked Microsoft to mute the strength of macros, making
them less effective as viruses. Instead, Microsoft is beefing up
security, saying its customers like the power of macros. So the new
Office 2000 software tries to make it impossible to open a macro
virus accidentally. It's a sound step, but the company must keep
striking a balance between power and security.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 20,000 viruses found by such antivirus software
firms as Symantec, informed vigilance is the best protection
against infection.

CHARGES MAY BE PULLED IN DIALLO PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-POLICE-HARASSMENT) 
(DW) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M.
Morgenthau, said Friday that he would probably ask for the
dismissal of charges against the 1,200 people who were arrested for
civil disobedience last month during the daily mass protests over
the police killing of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that was the usual practice for minor offenses
when ``there is no significant inconvenience to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they went out and blocked the Brooklyn
Bridge,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In systematic and well-publicized demonstrations at Police
headquarters that ended only this week with the arraignment of four
New York City police officers, hundreds of people a day were
charged with disorderly conduct for refusing to leave One Police
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that because the protests were not violent, the
detention of the protesters for five to seven hours on the days of
their arrests was enough punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a model demonstration, both on the part of the
protesters and the police,'' he said. ``I just think it's the right
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said in a statement Friday that
he disagreed with Morgenthau's plan. ``It is my opinion that these
summonses should have been prosecuted through the system with a
judge making the final determination,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that the most each protester would face if
convicted would be a $250 fine. The protesters would not have
received jail time or criminal records because they had been
charged with a violation, the equivalent of a traffic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting all of the cases would not only strain the burdened
criminal courts, which were able to handle fewer than 800 trials
last year, but would also provide the protest movement another
stage for gaining publicity for its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were national and local politicians,
actors, civil rights leaders and religious figures.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he and other lawyers who were defending the
protesters had urged Morgenthau to ask for dismissals in a meeting
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of people arrested, including the organizer of
the mass protests, the Rev. Al Sharpton, is scheduled to appear in
court on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Requests from prosecutors to dismiss charges are usually made at
the first hearing on the charges before a criminal court judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now expect the cases to be dismissed in the interest of
justice,'' Siegel said. ``This would be, in our opinion, the
correct thing to do, because otherwise the criminal justice system
would be facing a huge logistical nightmare that would backlog the
courts for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest movement that was ignited by the Feb. 4 killing of
Diallo, an unarmed Guinean immigrant, now confronts a new
challenge: how to maintain its momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups, including Women for Justice, planned
demonstrations and prayer vigils in front of station houses in
nearly 30 police precincts around the city. But the crowds were
thin.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was a demonstration outside the 26th Precinct
station house, at 520 W. 126th St., when a church service held to
oppose the death penalty drew several hundred people who went on to
protest the Diallo killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to focus our demands and our demands have to be
crystallized,'' said Johanna Fernandez, a Columbia University
graduate student who helped organize the service at St. Mary's
Episcopal Church, across the street from the police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movement needs leadership,'' she added. ``Al
Sharpton was instrumental in creating it, but now we need leaders
coming from all the communities and groups. We need to push it
further.''

JUDGE DENIES POSTPONEMENT BID IN LOUIMA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The judge in the case of four police officers charged
with brutalizing Abner Louima on Friday denied a postponement
request made by defense lawyers who said news coverage of the case
and of the police shooting of Amadou Diallo had given rise to
anti-police sentiment in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will be able to get a fair and impartial jury,''
Judge Eugene Nickerson of federal District Court in Brooklyn said
in denying the request. Citing the large number of prospective
jurors who filled out questionnaires on Monday to begin the
selection of 12 jurors and six alternates, the judge said, ``There
must be 18 people among 785 who will be fair and impartial.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers had sought a postponement of at least four
months.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers are accused of beating Louima, a Haitian
immigrant, in a police car after arresting him in a street brawl in
Brooklyn in 1997. Two of the four are also accused of torturing him
in a police station. A police sergeant, also on trial, is accused
of trying to cover up part of the alleged assault. All five deny
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Nickerson also rejected a defense motion to dismiss the entire
panel of prospective jurors and call in a new one, a motion made
after some panel members gave interviews to reporters outside the
courthouse Monday. The defense argued that the interviews had
tainted the panel and compromised the judge's earlier ruling that
the jurors would be anonymous, their identities not disclosed to
the public or the lawyers and other parties in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But in an effort to prevent further interviews, Nickerson
ordered that no one ``shall interview, talk to, photograph or
sketch any juror or prospective juror in the courthouse or
elsewhere during the duration of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Abrams, a lawyer specializing in First Amendment matters,
said that efforts to insure a fair trial for the defendants were
understandable, but the breadth of the order might be
unconstitutional because of the ban on photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to take steps to prevent any communication
between jurors or prospective jurors and the press,'' he said, ``or
to shield jurors and prospective jurors from the press in the
courthouse, but a ban on taking pictures of jurors or prospective
jurors outside the courthouse seems to me to be troublingly
overbroad.''

THE REFUGEE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 4, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By H.D.S. GREENWAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a symbol of this sorry century, it is the refugee _
shuffling along some dusty road, jungle trail, or mountain pass,
with a haunted-eyed family and a few pathetic belongings, trying to
reach safety but knowing that even if safety is reached, nothing
will ever be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees are the byproduct of wars, social disruption, and
disorder, and every century has had them. But this century has been
awash with refugees from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, where the century is ending with the forced
exodus from Kosovo, the early years saw similar scenes in the wars
of 1912 and 1913 _ similar tragedies with strikingly similar
atrocities as various ethnic groups and nationalities sought to
free themselves from the dying grip of the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   World War I saw a bloodletting of previously unimaginable
proportions, and the photographs of Belgians fleeing German
advances in their huge ox carts inflamed passions in the West, as
do the Kosovo images of today. Perhaps the most tragic of the
displaced persons of World War I were the Armenians of eastern
Anatolia, driven from their homes, beaten, starved, raped, and
murdered along their long march to the Syrian desert, from which
few returned. Theirs was an early brush with genocide, which would
also become a hallmark of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Each refugee is different, with a different story to tell, but
there is a dreadful similarity to them all. Here is how a young
reporter for The Toronto Daily Star named Ernest Hemingway
described the refugee-jammed roads leading towards Macedonia in
1922: ``Twenty miles of carts drawn by cows, bullocks, and
muddy-flanked water buffalo, with exhausted, staggering men, women,
and children, blankets over their heads, walking blindly along in
the rain beside their worldly goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the rain, that column of Greeks leaving Turkey
exactly matches the 20-mile columns I saw coming out of East Bengal
50 years later, columns you could find by watching for the vultures
in the sky, and the dogs eating the dead along the way, and the
lost babies floating in the shallow waters of river crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in Kosovo today, with people fleeing on foot and on
primitive transport, seems oddly old-fashioned. It could be Russia
during its civil war, when armies surged back and forth across 10
time zones displacing countless thousands in an orgy of murders and
revenge. Or it could be World War II and its aftermath, the
conflict that generated the greatest number of refugees in these
last 100 years. From Europe to the Far East, huge populations
trudged across the surface of the earth, looking, too often in
vain, for safety and sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The end of colonialism spawned another generation of misery.
During the partition of India, trainloads of Muslims going one way
and Hindus going the other would arrive in stations with their
throats cut by marauding bands of zealots up the line.
</P>
<P>
   In Indochina, the 30-year war produced its own mass
displacements. Cambodians in ox carts of the same design as those
depicted on 1,000-year-old friezes poured into the cities to escape
the fighting, only to be turned out again in the century's most
bizarre tyranny: the year zero of the Khmer Rouge. The snaking
processions of cars, carts, trucks, and buses that marked the end
of South Vietnam as the armies of the North approached were
transformed into fleets of scattered boats escaping yet again upon
the perilous waters of the South China Sea _ the flotsam and jetsam
of a lost war.
</P>
<P>
   Africa has perhaps suffered the most in the postcolonial era.
Brutalized by murderous intent, beset by endless wars, famines,
pestilence, and death, the emaciated African with the
concentration-camp stare may be the refugee century's most lasting
image.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the camps, rows upon rows of despair, cooped-up
families trying to cope with the meager rations, the diarrhea, the
dying children, and too often the brutality and indifference of
officials, with only the harried international aid workers to stave
off disaster. No one who has ever walked through these desperate
places can ever again take for granted the gift of belonging, of a
control over life, that everyone around has lost.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that the next century could be better,
that a certain stability would take hold now that the world is rid
of the Cold War. But as the century ends the way it began, there is
every indication that in the next millennium, dogs will still be
eating the dead along the roadsides as endless columns of the
dispossessed pass by.

THE CURIOUS PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHICH FOODS GET TAXED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sure, it was a small thing, but to shopkeepers,
it was a milestone nonetheless. Last year, New York abolished
marshmallow discrimination, the long-standing rule that while
marshmallows were subject to the sales tax, mini-marshmallows were
not.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where business has long complained that regulations
take on the rigor, complexity and fervor of religion, the
marshmallow dichotomy had become a sort of reverse talisman, a
notorious symbol of all that was wrong with New York's ample
bureaucracy. And now, after the ruling that marshmallows are candy
no matter how small, all marshmallows bear a 4 percent state sales
tax, plus a local tax of about the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took away my best line,'' said Michael Rosen, vice
president of the Food Industry Alliance of New York state, who
liked to cite the marshmallow rule in his critiques of state
government.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't worry _ the sales tax rules still supply plenty of
material. Consider, for example, the amazing, transforming Twix.
Sold by the box from a store shelf, the state deems it a cookie,
and thus tax free. But sold in a single package at the check-out
counter, it morphs into a candy, and becomes taxable.
</P>
<P>
   If that distinction is lost on you, try these: Mini-M&AMP;Ms are tax
free, though the regular-sized ones are taxed. Aussie Mega shampoo?
Taxable. Head &AMP; Shoulders? Nontaxable. Powdered drink mixes are
taxed. Except Tang. Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to keep track of it,'' said Brian
Riesenburger, manager of the Fairway store on Broadway at 74th
Street in Manhattan. ``It's so easy to make mistakes, and we're
constantly calling up the state to make sure we're doing it right
so we don't get in trouble. On salad there's no tax, but on fruit
salad there's tax. Where's the sense?''
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the sales tax, especially as it applies to
food, has been historically subject to a particularly fine degree
of hair-splitting at the state Department of Taxation and Finance,
which has the job of interpreting tax laws. Retailers say that
other states have nonsensical tax rules, too, but that New York
stands out in its knack for making the simple complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insane,'' Michael Urbach, the state commissioner of
taxation and finance, said of the current system of rules. ``From
the time I began to see this stuff, I wondered, `What were they
thinking?'''
</P>
<P>
   He will probably never get an answer. Many of the rules were
imposed in the first years after New York adopted a sales tax in
1965, and the civil servants who devised them are either retired or
dead.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner and the man who appointed him, Gov. George
Pataki, have long said that they wanted to simplify the tax rules,
which were largely imposed by departmental decree rather than by
legislation, and can be changed the same way. It is no surprise
that Urbach began last year by doing away with the marshmallow
dichotomy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he plans to eliminate other such distinctions, but that
he has to move carefully, both to make sure the changes are within
his legal power and to take into account the sums of money
involved. Usually, he estimated, making a rule more uniform would
mean no more than tens of thousands of dollars a year gained or
lost by the state. But in some cases, he said, it could mean
millions, not a trivial amount, even in a state with a $71 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Each rule rests on a bit of logic that sounds, to the
uninitiated and expert alike, a little tortured.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, state law says that candy, unlike most food, is
taxable, and great effort has gone into judging what is candy and
what is not. Thus, the marshmallow rule. Marshmallows, the
department decided, were candy, but mini-marshmallows were a
cooking ingredient, and so were nontaxable. The same went for
mini-M&AMP;Ms.
</P>
<P>
   The law dictates that medical products are nontaxable, but what,
exactly, is a medical product? Dandruff shampoo, the department has
ruled, but not regular shampoo; sterile cotton balls, but not
regular cotton balls; adult bladder-control underpants, but not
baby diapers.
</P>
<P>
   The state long ago decreed that foods meant to be taken home
were tax free, but that anything meant to be eaten on the spot was
taxable, a discrimination whose justification has been lost in the
mists of time. So a pint of ice cream is not taxed, but an ice
cream cone is. A frozen knish is tax free, but one right out of the
oven is taxed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for the reasoning that turns Twix from cookie to candy, state
officials just shrug their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the ``cheese-board rule.'' Cheese, crackers, fruit
and jams are all nontaxable. But wrap them in one of those popular
gift packs, add a taxable cutting board or basket, and the whole
thing becomes taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Strangest of all is the rule that states that among powdered
drink mixes, only Tang is free from sales tax. No one seems to know
why. ``I've heard it's because they took it to the Moon, but I'm
not sure what that has to do with anything,'' Urbach said.
</P>
<P>
   If the state, in reviewing a store's records, finds that it
failed to levy the tax, the shop is still liable for it. State
officials and shopkeepers say they cannot recall anyone being
penalized for collecting too much tax, so many store owners say
that when in doubt, they tax, rather than run afoul of the state,
an approach that can irk customers who catch on.
</P>
<P>
   On something as small as a candy bar, a store usually adjusts
the price so that, with tax, it becomes a round number, and the
shopper rarely notices the levy. But with higher-priced items, the
tax becomes more noticeable to the customer, and store owners say
they sometimes end up being peppered with questions about the bills
that they are ill-equipped to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are a particular burden on the majority of stores in
New York that do less than $100,000 a year in business, said Mark
Alesse, state director of the National Federation of Independent
Business. Unlike larger stores that are equipped with computer
scanners that automatically apply the tax where appropriate, small
shops have to train cashiers to memorize the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mom-and-pop operations,'' Alesse said. ``They don't
have staff to devote to tracking this stuff, and their employees
tend to be teen-agers working part time.''
</P>
<P>
   One such store is DiNapoli Deli, at Third and Marine Avenues in
the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. ``It's a dumb system, and it's
hard for us,'' said Louis DiNapoli, owner of the store. ``Listen to
this: I sell cold cuts _ salami, prosciutto _ there's no tax, but I
put them on a platter or a piece of bread, there's tax. And if I
sell a whole salami ...''

VIRUS WRITING DRAWS GROWING NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass., N.J. , Pa.)   (See also MELISSA-VIRUS) 
(rk) 
 By   MATT RICHTEL and JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of cyberspace, the sport of virus writing has
become the latter-day equivalent of the urge to write ``Kilroy was
here'' on the wall of the school auditorium. And it is a hobby with
a growing following.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the Melissa virus a week ago, and the
announcement Friday of an arrest in the case, underscores the
growth on the Internet of a community of virus writers and
collectors. They freely trade malicious code, combine efforts to
best the work of antivirus researchers, and post their creations on
the Internet for anyone to download and release into the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like candy _ a child can get these, a 12-year-old can get
these,'' said Sarah Gordon, an antivirus researcher for IBM who
spent five years researching the virus-writing subculture. She said
it required little technical expertise to introduce a virus once it
was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trivial,'' she said. ``All you do is download it to a
computer, click on it, and there you go.''
</P>
<P>
   As the computer has become ubiquitous, the image of the bad guy
of the technology era, the bespectacled introvert who attacks
computer networks by keystroke, has emerged. Within this category,
there exists a subset of virus writers, a subculture within the
subculture.
</P>
<P>
   The International Computer Security Association, an industry
corporation based in Carlisle, Pa., estimated last year that there
were 15,000 to 20,000 viruses in circulation, with 1,000 emerging
each month.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small number are widely circulated, or ``make it into the
wild,'' in the industry vernacular. But their proliferation has
given rise to a highly competitive industry of companies that seek
out the latest strains and find and market software antidotes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, virus writing has been perceived as having less
status in the hacker set than cracking into government and
corporate computers. But virus writing appears to have become more
attractive to hackers as publicity around viruses has grown, say
computer buffs and executives at antivirus companies.
</P>
<P>
   One early group of virus writers, 40Hex, which published a
magazine, emerged in the early 1990s, said Jeff Moss, the founder
of Defcon, an annual gathering of the computer underground. ``They
were going to cause the downfall of civilization, but then they got
bored after awhile,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't that much happening in virus writing,'' he added,
``so the more motivated people went off to normal hacking.'' As
opposed to hacking, which can demand a range of skill levels, virus
writing traditionally attracted a more technically oriented set.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, virus writing has experienced a resurgence,
generally attracting a less technically adept group. Increasingly,
simple templates are available for use in virus writing and
breaking into computers, making the endeavor open to copycats and
less adept programmers.
</P>
<P>
   In the underground, these copycats are known as script kiddies.
In the world of virus writing, they are termed ``scripters,'' a
name Ms. Gordon gave to them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gordon said virus-writing enthusiasts had evolved from the
late 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a small group of people with these interests,''
she said. ``With the advent of the Internet, the community has
widened and accessibility of applications to young people has
increased.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That scenario may have particular currency in the case of the
Melissa virus; some computer security experts have suggested that
David L. Smith, the New Jersey man arrested in the case Friday,
cobbled together his own virus code with virus templates he found
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in New Jersey said they did not believe that Smith
is the virus writer known as VicodinES, whose handle has been
linked in Internet postings with the creation and dissemination of
Melissa. What is certain is that VicodinES, whoever he or she is,
has a Web site that advocates the creation and use of viruses, and
Smith's name was found in a number of documents on that Web site
dating back at least a year, said Richard Smith, an independent
software developer in Cambridge, Mass., who is an amateur computer
sleuth.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which was taken down on Tuesday night by Access
Orlando, the Internet service provider in Orlando, Fla., where the
Web server was located, served as a bulletin board and downloading
site for viruses. It contained commentary by the author who
identified himself as VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   But some virus writers contend that it is far too simplistic to
characterize all virus writers as malicious. Some are attracted to
virus writing because they want to deconstruct programming code,
see how it works, and poke holes in it as an intellectual endeavor,
said a longtime virus writer known as Attitude Adjuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that all of us out here are malicious teen-agers is
quite a fallacy,'' said Attitude Adjuster, who was contacted by
e-mail and declined to give his real name. ``There are those of us
who still exist in the community who write viruses because it's
fun. We don't give our viruses to the public and nobody gets
hurt.''

THAT SYNCHING FEELING

<TEXT>
<P>
   We lost only an hour, but it feels like two. The first Monday
after the clocks spring forward is the real test of time; Sunday is
too relaxed to count.
</P>
<P>
   Clocks, external and internal, tick much more loudly at the
office. Coffee breaks, walks, trips to the check-cashing window,
meetings, and deadlines all have their designated slots in the
eight-hour shift, which has just shifted gears. The entire day
feels off center, beginning and ending too early and announcing a
high noon that's not quite high enough for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   People won't be in synch with the rhythm for a couple of days,
maybe not for a week, as they adjust to trading morning sleep for
evening light. It's a fair trade with excellent long-term benefits,
but the short term is a killer, especially for anyone who is into
power breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving work under a too-bright afternoon sky can make a person
feel guilty about ducking responsibility after months of exiting in
shadow or, more recently, in the glare of a setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   A restlessness sets in, too, for one feels one should be making
good use of the extra daylight hours Congress has given the
American people. But by the time one gets home and changed, there
isn't quite enough sun left for a long ballgame. The climate isn't
warm enough for planting, and the grass isn't ready for cutting.
</P>
<P>
   So a person stands on the porch, hands in pockets, watching the
dusk come on and listening to the peepers singing in the wetlands _
a fine, if passive, way to appreciate the gift of light.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from ``standard'' to ``daylight saving'' mirrors
a lot of passages in life _ looked forward to, celebrated, but
still not easy. Changing jobs, getting married, going to graduate
school, having children, and retiring all take people into
different time zones that promise growth for the price of the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities beckon now, despite the grimace at the alarm
clock and the extra coffee needed to see it clearly. Tomorrow will
be easier, and soon the game will go into extra innings.

CHAIN E-MAIL

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop the e-mail madness! In addition to destructive viruses,
e-mail has been the conduit for a troubling collection of chain
letters, petitions, and virus hoaxes. At the heart of the problem
are individuals who continue to circulate these documents.
</P>
<P>
   One example is a hoax and chain letter in one, the so-called
Disney Giveaway. A letter that appears to be from Bill Gates and
Walt Disney Jr. claims that Disney and Microsoft are experimenting
with an e-mail tracer program, and the companies need ``your
help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forward this,'' the e-mail says, ``to everyone you know, and
if it reaches 13,000 people, 1,300 of the people on the list will
receive $5,000, and the rest will receive a free trip for two to
Disney World for one week during the summer of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disney World says there's no experiment and no free
vacation. And there's no Walt Disney Jr. Walt Disney Sr. had only
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Stumping for a good cause, another e-mailed petition claimed to
be gathering support to defend National Public Radio and the Public
Broadcasting Service from funding cuts. This was a legitimate
effort in 1995 by students at the University of Northern Colorado.
But the students were reprimanded for misuse of university
resources. Still, the petition continued to be passed around _ and
dutifully signed _ for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Other chain letters warn about computer viruses. Some are true,
others false. Either way, the US Energy Department offers this
sound advice: Don't forward the warning to ``everyone you know,''
as messages may request. Even if a warning is real, it's best given
to security professionals such as the computer emergency response
team at Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's computer incident advisory group and
others have Web sites tracking many of these messages. But the main
defense has to be people who refuse to forward nuisance e-mail
messages, scold friends for sending them, and loudly say: This is
too good to be true.

   Many pollutants are beneficial when used as intended. Had the
Exxon Valdez not foundered, its cargo would have provided energy to
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   With money in politics, however _ especially big, private money
_ it is the intended effect that is polluting. Special interests
give politicians donations to help them win elections and to earn
credit from the victors when they take office. The bigger the
contribution, the greater the credit. Left out are average citizens
who contribute only a vote and who understand, increasingly, that
many politicians prefer the money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Massachusetts and Arizona residents passed election
reforms that rely heavily on public financing. This followed
reports of campaign abuses; even Congress gave a nod toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   But now the nod looks more like a wink. Neither branch of
Congress is pushing even the most basic reform _ to eliminate
notoriously corrosive soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And candidates far and near are acting more callous than ever.
The news out of Austin, Texas, last week was not only that Governor
George W. Bush had raised more than $6 million in less than a month
toward a presidential campaign that is not even announced yet, but
also that he is considering bypassing the well-established system
of partial public financing. If Bush and publisher Steve Forbes run
a megabucks campaign that explodes past voluntary limits and vastly
outspends their competitors, the loser will be democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, funding needed by the Clean Elections system
approved by the voters is likely to win support in the Senate but
was not recommended by Governor Cellucci, and the House position is
unclear. Meanwhile, Cellucci and several other officeholders are
taking in contributions that will probably exclude them from Clean
Elections funding _ putting them back in the big money past.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Money and Politics Project reports that 90
percent of contested legislative races last year were won by the
candidate who spent more. Money wins. Private special-interest
money pollutes.

COST OF GUARDS SAID TO PROMPT GOTTI REQUEST TO RETURN TO JAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ John A. Gotti requested to return to jail
because the cost and intrusiveness of guards and other conditions
of his bail will no longer make sense once he begins spending much
of his days on trial here, his sister and a lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, who is to go on trial Tuesday on charges of racketeering
and extortion, stunned a federal courtroom Thursday when he asked
Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. to return him to jail in nearby
Valhalla and end the arrangement in which he lives at home and pays
$5,000 a week for guards to patrol his property. His telephone
calls are also monitored. The judge granted the request, effective
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti spent nine months in jail until his lawyers were able to
negotiate his release in October on a $10 million bond secured by
the properties of two dozen relatives, friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, who federal prosecutors say has been the acting boss of
the Gambino crime family since his father, John J. Gotti, was given
a life sentence for murder in 1992, did not give the reasons for
his request.
</P>
<P>
   But his sister, Victoria Gotti, said that he felt it was
senseless to pay for guards to patrol his home in Oyster Bay 24
hours a day when he will soon spend much of his time at U.S.
District Court here, closer to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gotti, a novelist whose husband, Carmine Agnello, owns an
auto salvage business, has been paying much of the cost for the
guards, a point she said has wounded Gotti's pride.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer in the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that although Gotti appreciated being home with his wife and
children and being able to meet with his lawyers in their Manhattan
offices, he has been dissatisfied with the conditions for his bail.
</P>
<P>
   He is barred from meeting with certain friends and relatives,
including Agnello, a suspected associate of the Gambino crime
family. And the monitoring of his phones makes his wife
uncomfortable about speaking with her friends, said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more controlled by the government out than when he's
in,'' said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 35, is charged with leading a mob enterprise that, among
other crimes, extorted more than $1 million from the former owner
and employees of Scores, a Manhattan strip club. If convicted, he
faces up to 20 years in jail.

WEATHER PLAYS COLD PRANK ON ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 and LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An April storm delivered surprises Friday to almost every part
of Arizona, burying newly sprouted spring flowers in Flagstaff
under 20 inches of snow and isolating a village northeast of
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer who flew in from England to take scenic photos of
sunny Arizona ran into a wind storm. He will have to come back
another week.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists arriving at Sky Harbor International Airport for an
Easter getaway in balmy Phoenix grumbled about the raw weather.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days into spring, the wintry storm swept the state,
dumping several feet of snow in some northern locations that had
barely seen a flake until now. The wind and rain dropped Valley
temperatures to 30 degrees below normal. The high in Phoe nix on
Friday reached only 59 degrees _ the first time the mercury had
failed to reach 60 on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   The effects were far-ranging.
</P>
<P>
   Some northern Arizona highways had to be shut down. Drivers
wrestled with chains weeks after they removed snow tires.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in Flagstaff closed.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Valley, people searched for packed-away sweaters and
hats. Avondale and Carefree residents marveled at the snow that
temporarily graced their lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Flurries were reported at several locations in the Valley on
Friday. The Tradition Golf Tournament in north Scottsdale and the
Rattlers' Rally for the Arizona Rattlers arena football team were
canceled Friday because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   And snowbirds, in town for Easter weekend, found it colder in
the Valley of the Sun than in the places they'd tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The spring storm dumped more snow than some places had received
all winter.
</P>
<P>
   Flagstaff's 20 inches was 69 percent of the winter's total of 29
inches.
</P>
<P>
   Weather watchers say a slow-moving low-pressure system, coupled
with a cold jet stream from the Gulf of Alaska, created the
surprising spring weather. And coming in the midst of La Nina,
which has brought warmer, drier conditions, many found it a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual,'' said Sean McLaughlin, a meteorologist for
Channel 12 (KPNX). ``There's the whole psychological effect of
people saying, `Gosh, it's a late storm.' ''
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures in Phoenix at the beginning of April usually
hover around 80 degrees. Today's temperatures will be in the low
60s and remain the same for Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The first low-pressure system hit Thursday, dumping snow
throughout northern Arizona. McLaughlin said the jet stream, which
carried the system, normally would have carried the cold to the
Rockies. Instead, it parked over southern Utah, sending snow and
cold to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's damp came from another system that moved through. A
third system should show up Sunday, bringing more rain and snow,
McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nasty,'' said Tyree Wild, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Flagstaff. ``Definitely not good for an
Easter egg hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The snowstorm followed a windstorm earlier this week in which
gusts reaching 100 mph sent trucks tumbling and closed a stretch of
Interstate 40 for 11 hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, chains were required, even on vehicles with
four-wheel drive, in many parts of northern Arizona. The Beeline
Highway (Arizona 87) closed just north of Sunflower because of
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Chris Coe was looking for biking, hiking weather,
blue skies, sunshine and lots of wildflowers when he came from
England to do a promotional shoot for the Arizona Department of
Tourism. By the end of this week, he was wearing a sweat shirt
instead of sunscreen, but he did get desert shots with snow on
them.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to come back in October for the shots he didn't get,
said Leia James, marketing and communications director for the
Department of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The department also took calls from tourists asking when this
weather cycle was going to break.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go to a higher authority to get the answer to that
question,'' she told them. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Although this weather may have upset tourists, it also
challenged Valley residents who have guests in town, feeling the
guilt of having people come visit from cooler climates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's warmer in Iowa this week than here,'' said schoolteacher
Teri Lewis, who lives Iowa City. She was on spring break and
staying at a motel near South Mountain, where she and a friend had
hoped to hike and run every day.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the weather would be warm, she brought only one pair
of sweats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm freezing,'' she said Friday, on her way to the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the prettiest snowy places in the state were impossible
to reach Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pleasant and picturesque, utterly tranquil up here _
like a scene out of a magazine,'' Don Underhill said of the
picture-postcard view from his Alpine Lodge, 8,000 feet up Mount
Lemmon near Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The only problems he and other residents of Summerhaven have is,
they're stranded and without power.
</P>
<P>
   Summerhaven has been snowed in for two days. The flakes began at
8 a.m. Thursday and haven't stopped. About 4 feet of snow has piled
up, Underhill said Friday by phone, and Summerhaven residents are
keeping warm by the lodge fireplace. They hope the road will be
opened today.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, officials at HomeBase Youth Services, which helps 35
or 40 kids under 21 who live on the street, say this cold weather
worsens an already difficult situation. The organization
distributes sleeping bags, which are no good to anyone when they
get wet.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Leach, executive director of HomeBase Youth Services,
worries that someone using the wet bags will get pneumonia or
bronchial infections, beginning another cycle of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone objected to the cold and rainy weather. Some people
enjoyed the cold and snowy weather, playing hooky from work or just
settling in by their fireplaces. &QL;

CLIMBING BROOKLYN BRIDGE AS STUNT, MAN FALLS TO DEATH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 27-year-old man apparently hoping to gain a spot in
the Guinness Book of World Records fell to his death Friday morning
while scaling a steel suspension cable on the Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The climber, Robert C. Landeta, told a witness that he planned
to set a world record by climbing five bridges in four hours, said
a police spokesman, John Giammarino.
</P>
<P>
   However, Landeta did not get further than the Brooklyn Bridge,
his first of the morning, Giammarino said.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:17 a.m., after Landeta got halfway up one of the steel
cables, his hand apparently slipped and he plunged approximately
250 feet to his death.
</P>
<P>
   He landed on the Brooklyn side of the bridge, in an alley next
to the River Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old friend who was there to record the endeavor caught
the entire incident on videotape, said the police, who did not
release the boy's name.
</P>
<P>
   Landeta's ambition apparently exceeded his experience. He had no
published accomplishments as a daredevil, and it was unclear Friday
night whether his family knew of his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The Guinness Book of World Records contains no entry for bridge
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 edition lists only one feat related to bridges: Donald
H. Betty of Lancaster, Pa., has walked across 98 different
suspension bridges around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since its construction in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge has
attracted the daring and the desperate. In 1984, two men who
climbed one of the gothic stone towers for a thrill were arrested
and charged with misdemeanors after tying up bridge traffic for two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic again came to a halt on a morning in May 1993, when a
naked man shouting ``it's a beautiful day'' was struck and killed
by a car, just hours before a suicidal woman climbed the cables and
threatened to jump.
</P>
<P>
   Only employees of the city's Department of Transportation are
permitted to climb the bridge, an agency spokesman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Landeta lived at 31 Fleet Walk in Brooklyn. His immediate family
could not be reached for comment Friday. An uncle, Jose Landeta,
said that he knew little about the incident or his nephew's
climbing exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Landeta set out wearing a pair of black climbing
shoes, pants and jacket in a camouflage pattern and a small pair of
goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Before he began to climb, he told a photographer who happened to
be at the bridge that he was attempting to establish a world
record.
</P>
<P>
   He began at the bridge's road deck, 133 feet above the East
River. With a small crowd watching, he climbed more than 100 feet
before he slipped, and slid down the cable to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The police did not know whether he had been climbing one of two
wide cables, or one of the skinnier suspension cables.
</P>
<P>
   He landed to the side of the River Cafe, a few yards from a
warehouse for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.
</P>
<P>
   Workers nearby said they had not seen him fall and only noticed
the commotion when the police arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Ryan, a construction worker repairing the bridge's road
deck, said that he learned of Landeta's fall when he saw ``two kids
come running across'' the car lanes.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying distance below them, Landeta lay on his back, dead
from the impact. His pants were in shreds, and his wallet, driver's
license, pager and keys were strewn in a nearby puddle.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the River Cafe, a back room manager for the restaurant,
Peter Demers, taped garbage bags and cardboard over a section of
chain-link fence so that the body would not be visible to lunchtime
patrons.

FOREMAN SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY IN CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION OF IBF
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former heavyweight champion George Foreman has been subpoenaed
to testify before a federal grand jury in New Jersey that is
investigating allegations of corruption by the IBF, said a lawyer
Foreman retained a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Lawrence Wechsler, based in Washington, said he had
not spoken to Foreman at length about the inquiry and did not know
what kind of information federal prosecutors were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler, who represented Betty Currie, President Clinton's
secretary, in the Monica Lewinsky inquiry, said he confirmed on
Monday with Jose Sierra, an assistant U.S. attorney in Newark, that
Foreman had been subpoenaed, but he did not know when Foreman would
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler told The Bergen Record that federal prosecutors view
Foreman as a victim of an extortion scheme run by the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Druwniak, a spokesman with the U.S. attorney's office in
Newark, refused to comment on the investigation or whether Foreman
had been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lee, the IBF president, has denied any wrongdoing. Gerald
Krovatin, Lee's lawyer, told The Associated Press that the
investigation was groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 15 years, people have been making allegations against Bob
Lee that have proven false and hollow and gone absolutely
nowhere,'' Krovatin said. ``I have no reason to believe that this
investigation will be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman had a run-in with Lee in 1995 after his controversial
split decision over Axel Schulz. Foreman retained his IBF title
with the victory, but he refused to defend it in a rematch against
Schulz and Lee stripped him of the title.
</P>
<P>
   Lee elevated Francois Botha to the No. 1 contender spot ahead of
Evander Holyfield, Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer and Ray Mercer.
Botha beat Schulz in a match for the vacant title, but Botha was
stripped of the title for testing positive for steroids after the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Moorer sued the IBF to get ranked as the No. 1 contender and
later won a split decision over Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer, said Holyfield had not been
subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in Newark. ``We don't
know anything about any of this, and we'd be the last to know
anyway,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Lee said that the organization had
some problems with its ranking system and had recently overhauled
it so that the No. 1 and No. 2 contenders had to fight each other
before fighting for a title.
</P>
<P>
   However, the coming May bout between Felix Trinidad, the IBF
welterweight champion, against Vincent Petway, the No. 1 contender,
has raised some eyebrows in the boxing industry. Trinidad has been
ordered by the IBF to fight Petway or lose his title.
</P>
<P>
   Petway has fought twice in the last three years _ once in 1997
and once in 1999. Those two fights were against the same boxer _
Gerald Reed, who is 37 years old and has a 15-24-3 record. Reed
took Petway the distance in both fights. &QL;

RANGERS SITTING OUT CHASE FOR ROGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers do not appear to be among
the prominent suitors for left-hander Kenny Rogers, whom the
Oakland Athletics could trade before Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin Friday acknowledged recent
conversations with A's general manager Billy Beane, but he declined
to discuss specifics or whether their dialogue continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him, and they could move him before the season
starts,'' Melvin said. ``We haven't had any lengthy discussions,
though. We never got into specific names, but if you're going to
get someone's No. 1 starter before the season starts, you're
probably going to overpay for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not appear willing to entertain such a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I hear, everything is dead,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``D-E-A-D. Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians and New York Mets appear to be the leading
candidates to acquire the 34-year-old Rogers, who went 16-8 with a
3.17 earned-run average for the A's during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had discussions, and I would anticipate having more
discussions,'' Beane told reporters earlier this week. ``From the
A's standpoint, if we do something, we want to make sure we find a
balance _ something that doesn't just address the future, but
allows us to address the present, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets reportedly offered right-handers Masato Yoshii, Jason
Isringhausen and Octavio Dotel for Rogers, while the Indians'
proposal included right-hander Dwight Gooden and first baseman
Richie Sexson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The asking price for Rogers is pretty steep for one year,''
Indians general manager John Hart said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who can become a free agent after this season, continues
to be slowed this spring by inflammation in his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some concerns with Kenny's elbow, too,'' Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers will miss his scheduled Opening Day start against the New
York Yankees, who instead will be opposed by right-hander Gil
Heredia. The A's plan for Rogers to pitch during a simulated game
Sunday and build his endurance to 80-85 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, though, has yet to pitch more than three innings or
throw more than 45 pitches during an appearance this spring.
Nevertheless, the A's expect Rogers to start Thursday against the
Seattle Mariners at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who pitched for the Rangers from 1989-95, reiterated his
desire to return to Texas earlier this spring. Rogers went 70-51
with a 3.88 ERA during his 376 appearances with the Rangers, and
that included his perfect game against the Anaheim Angels on July
28, 1994, at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin knows of Rogers' desire and that the Rangers will be
linked to every trade rumor involving the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will go on all year,'' Melvin said.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ |Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore did not
attempt to hide his frustration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, whose healthy knees served as the source of his
renewed enthusiasm this spring, removed himself from last night's
game after experiencing tightness in his left hamstring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McLemore departed the game immediately after his
over-the-shoulder catch of Derek Bell's popup in foul territory
down the right-field line for the third out of the first inning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through the entire spring without anything except a
broken fingernail, and then this happens,'' said McLemore, who has
under.MDBU/gone[ .MDNM/went.MDBU/].MDNM/ four knee surgeries since
May .MDBU/of .MDNM/1997. ``I don't want to sound like it's all
gloom and doom, but it's just frustrating.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days remain before Opening Day, but the injury clouds
McLemore's availability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know more .MDBU/\R.MDNM/today.MDBU/\S.MDNM/,'' McLemore
said. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Rangers get third baseman &QL; 
[body]The Rangers yesterday gained depth at third base after being
awarded Toronto third baseman Tom Evans on a waiver claim for
$20,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evans, whom the Rangers do not expect to join the ballclub for
today's exhibition game with the New York Mets at The Ballpark in
Arlington, likely will begin this season at Triple-A Oklahoma. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lack a third baseman with significant major-league
experience in their minor-league system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not that deep at third base,'' general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``We don't have an experienced guy, and he's got
some.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evans, 24, hit .233.MDBU/[ .MDNM/(10-for-43).MDBU/].MDNM/ with
one run batted in during 26 games this spring with the Blue Jays.

</P>
<P>
   Evans once appeared to be the Blue Jays' third baseman.MDBU/

stalled his progress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good reports on him,'' Melvin said. ``He's a young
third baseman who put up pretty good numbers at Triple-A last
year.'' &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Angels nab Levine &QL; 
[body]The move likely will not alter the balance of power in the
American League West, but the Anaheim Angels yesterday claimed
former Rangers right-hander Al Levine on unconditional release
waivers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Levine, whom the Rangers released Wednesday, must decide within
five days whether to accept the assignment or elect free agency.
Levine, 30, went 2-1 with one save and a 5.23 earned-run average
during seven appearances covering 10 1/3 innings this spring for
the Rangers. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Mateo set for scan &QL; 
[body]The Rangers scheduled outfielder Ruben Mateo to undergo a
bone scan for his right wrist this morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mateo experienced discomfort in the wrist during batting
practice yesterday and served only as a seventh-inning pinch-runner
for Rafael Palmeiro. Mateo suffered a bone bruise to the wrist
earlier this spring and underwent tests, which then proved
negative. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll check it out again to make sure there's nothing there,''
manager Johnny Oates said. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:Briefly &QL; 
[body][s]The Rangers yesterday reached an agreement with
KDXT//106.7 FM, which will broadcast the 162-game schedule in
Spanish this season. KESS//1270 AM also will broadcast one game per
week in Spanish on either Saturday or Sunday. That schedule remains
to be determined. Luis Mayoral and Josue Perez will call the
action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   [s]The Astros scratched Jack Howell from the starting lineup
after the infielder .MDBU/injured[ .MDNM/irritated.MDBU/].MDNM/ his
left hamstring before last night's game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   [s]The Astros yesterday purchased the contract of right-hander
Brian Williams and sent right-hander Dean Crow outright to Triple-A
New Orleans. &QL; 
\Nsubheds:{Rangers 6, Astros 5} &QL; 
[agatea]The Rangers overcame a one-run, seventh-inning deficit for
the victory. Designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro's one-out,
run-scoring double tied the game, and third baseman Jon Shave
delivered a two-run, game-winning game in the next at-bat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {At the plate:} Left fielder Rusty Greer delivered the necessary
ground ball to score catcher Ivan Rodriguez from the third base
during the first inning. The Astros played their infield at normal
depth, and Greer put the two-strike pitch from left-hander Mike
Hampton in play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {On the mound:} Right-hander Mark Clark's only real struggle
occurred during the Astros' two-run second inning. Clark
surrendered solo home runs to center fielder Glen Barker and third
baseman Bill Spiers and a double to first baseman Jeff Bagwell.
Clark placed himself at a disadvantage by being forced to throw
fastballs after falling behind in the count to hitters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {In the field:} First baseman Lee Stevens robbed Astros third
baseman Bill Spiers of a third-inning single with a diving stop to
his right and provided an accurate feed to[ pitcher Mark] Clark,
who covered the bag. &QL;

COLLINS CHOOSES `EVERYDAY' SHEETS
</HEADLINE>

By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels are excited for the 1999
season to begin, what with the expectations of a banner year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most excited player is recently acquired utility
infielder Andy Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins confirmed that Sheets would be his
everyday shortstop until Gary DiSarcina returns in three to four
months from surgery on his left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be out there on a daily basis,'' Collins said
prior to Friday night's Freeway game against the Los Angeles
Dodgers. ``He can run and catch the ball and he has a great arm. If
he hits, that's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels acquired Sheets from the San Diego Padres earlier
this week in a trade for catcher Phil Nevin. Sheets, a key bench
player for San Diego's World Series team a year ago, batted .242
with 31 runs, seven home runs and 29 RBI in 88 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about it,'' said Sheets, who spent part of
1997 with the Seattle Mariners, including a stint at third base for
the injured Russ Davis. ``I'm finally getting a chance to play
short and I just want to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, 27, said he doesn't need to live up to DiSarcina's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to come in and fill his shoes,'' Sheets said.
``He's a big part of this team, so I'm just here to hold down short
until he gets back. ... But still, I don't think anyone's as
excited as me for the season to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Line drive: Left-hander Chuck Finley is still recovering from a
line drive he took on the left bicep in the team's final spring
game in Tempe, Ariz., on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Finley will not pitch today in the team's
exhibition game against the Aguascalientes Railroadmen, but could
see action against Cal State Fullerton on Sunday or possibly Monday
in a simulated game.
</P>
<P>
   Finley suffered a large bruise on his arm, but threw on the side
Friday with no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he felt fine, but we'll just have to wait and see
because you don't know if it will swell up and not feel fine
tomorrow,'' Collins said. ``If we have to skip him on start it
won't kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has MRI: Center fielder Jim Edmonds sat out Friday's
game, still trying to shake a groin injury and some back pain he
has been experiencing lately.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds underwent an MRI on his back and a number of other tests
Friday at UC Irvine Medical Center to help determine his course of
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' said Edmonds, who spent six
hours at UCI. ``I'm just trying to prepare myself for (opening
day). The back is more of a precautionary thing. It's not something
that's bothered me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquisition: The Angels claimed right-handed pitcher Al Levine
of the Texas Rangers off waivers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, 30, split the 1998 season between Arlington and Triple-A
Oklahoma City. With the Rangers, Levine was 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA in
30 games.

RANGERS' HOPES DEALT A BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a grim showing for two star centers of the
Rangers Friday night in a critical game against Anaheim at Madison
Square Garden. Petr Nedved tried to play with injured ribs, skated
for about a minute in the first period, and sat the rest of the
night. Wayne Gretzky grimaced after an early hard hit from Kevin
Haller, then took four minutes in penalties for trying to spear
Haller.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mighty Ducks, it was a brilliant performance for two
star wings. Teemu Selanne, leading the National Hockey League in
goals, scored two more to raise his total to 45, improving his
candidacy for the first Maurice Richard Trophy. Paul Kariya, the
other dazzling forward on Anaheim's top line, scored one goal and
added an assist. His performance showed speed reminiscent of Yvon
Cournoyer, passes like Gretzky's in his prime and shots like those
of Guy Lafleur.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a 4-1 Anaheim victory, which left the Rangers
7 points out of a playoff berth with seven games remaining, five on
the road. They have played one more game than the Boston Bruins,
who hold the eighth and final berth in the Eastern Conference. The
Rangers played listlessly, managing only 13 shots, just three in
the first period. They are 2-4-2 in their last eight games. They
were not good, but the two main Ducks were better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great,'' Ranger Coach John Muckler said, referring to
Kariya and Selanne. ``I haven't seen two guys skate that hard in a
long time. They could play 60 minutes. They make your team retreat.
They are worth the admission. We backed off. They caused
turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, battered by Philadelphia checks and sticks last
Saturday, injured his ribs on Monday during a 3-1 victory over the
Islanders. He missed practice and left the pre-game warm-up early
Friday night. Nedved tried to play with a pain-killing injection,
but could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most frustrating thing,'' Nedved said. ``One thing I
know is I'm in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he had collided with Bryan Smolinski of the Islanders
and then doubled over in pain after a face-off a few minutes later.
When Nedved entered the building Friday afternoon, the stitched and
bruised skin around his right eye bore witness to another rough
game, the one before that, in Philadelphia, when he was cut by the
high stick of Eric Lindros, the Flyers' captain.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who passed Gordie Howe in career goals on Monday with
1,072, took a hard hit Friday night into the boards from Haller, a
defenseman who is known for baiting the best opponents. When
Rangers teammates formed a scrum around Haller in retaliation,
Gretzky circled the group and jabbed the blade end of his stick
toward Haller, without making contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of silly on my part,'' Gretzky said. ``I lost my cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers play their next four games on the road: Sunday at
the Devils, on Monday at Philadelphia, on Thursday at Chicago and
on Friday at Dallas. It is now very likely that they will miss the
post-season tournament for two consecutive years for the first time
in more than two decades. The Ducks, an improving and interesting
contender in the Western Conference, are 17-7-2 in their last 26
games. They will play their third game this week in the New York
area when they visit the Islanders Saturday night. At the same
time, Kariya's brother, Steve, will play for Maine against New
Hampshire in the championship game of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had a 2-0 lead on goalie Mike Richter before the
Rangers had taken a shot against the Ducks' Guy Hebert. Scoring
first was Selanne, who took advantage of a Brian Leetch turnover to
race in and fire the puck past Richter at 2 minutes 28 seconds.
Travis Green made it 2-0 at 6:43 by finishing a three-on-one rush.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens, who played an aggressive game, got one back for
the Rangers at 10:07 with a long slap shot, the first shot of the
game for the Rangers, which caromed off the glove of Hebert. The
Ducks made it 3-1 on the power play at 10:09 of the second period
when Selanne, next to Richter's crease, punched the puck over the
line after Kariya darted to a rebound, whirled and fed him a
perfect pass. Kariya made it 4-1 at 16:41 by one-timing a slap shot
from the top of the left-wing circle while drifting backward and
taking a pass as the teams skated four to a side.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, from Finland, could be seen smiling on the bench when
the scoreboard screen showed fans from his homeland waving the
national flag, wearing horned hats and cheering from the high
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was laughing,'' Selanne said. ``I think they were pretty
drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks visit here but once a year, so it was a sobering
experience for Ranger fans and players like Leetch. But even rivals
rave about them. ``It's exciting,'' he said, when asked what it is
like to play against Selanne and Kariya. ``They are always moving.
Very creative and very talented. There is always something going on
every shift.'' &QL;

MESSAGE TO MELVIN: DEAL FOR PITCHING NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ I flipped the calendar ahead three months to
July and flashed it in front of Doug Melvin's face last night at
The Ballpark in Arlington. Sorry, Rangers fans, he didn't bite.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if we all show up at today's exhibition game wearing
shorts and tank tops _ admittedly not a good look for me _ we can
somehow convince the Rangers general manager it's actually the end
of July instead of the first week in April.
</P>
<P>
   Trade-deadline time, Doug. Time to make a deal for some
pitching. Time to save the Rangers, again.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't played a game that means squat yet, but they
already look like they need saving.
</P>
<P>
   Move the fences in, says Juan Gonzalez? With this pitching
staff? You've got to be kidding.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that left Florida with a team earned-run average
that could challenge the New York Stock Exchange. The four starters
Johnny Oates ``likes'' had a combined 5.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, cornered in the press box during last night's exhibition
game, wore the hunted and resigned look of a man who has exhausted
all avenues in a search for starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a pitcher had a decent spring,'' Melvin said, ``he's not
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means there must be a lot of Rangers pitchers on the
``available'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The initial thought today was to demand that Melvin pull the
trigger on a deal for Kenny Rogers. There's talk he'll be traded
this weekend, inflamed elbow and all. Cleveland wants him. So do
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   So do the Rangers, but apparently not at the price it would take
to make the deal sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it now,'' Melvin said, ``you're going to overpay for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's not even talking about the $5 million a year the
payroll would have to absorb.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Oates would settle for just about anything. The
Knicks' player who hit Shaquille O'Neal in the back with a
basketball the other night _ is he available?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably my best team in eight-plus years of
managing,'' Oates said. ``We've got offensive balance, power,
speed. If there's a concern, it's the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not gimpy John Wetteland, mind you. Oates doesn't even want to
consider what it would mean if he couldn't pitch. It's what comes
before the ninth that worries him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good six-inning team,'' Oates said through his
rose-colored shades. ``The seventh and eighth innings will be so
important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone has to bridge the game from the sixth to the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those will be the key innings for us,'' Oates said. ``We're
probably not going to have a lot of complete games. A lot of our
games are going to be decided in the seventh and eighth innings.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not good.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, three relievers will be entrusted with the bulk
of the work in those two innings: left-hander Eric Gunderson and
right-handers Tim Crabtree and Danny Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree was terrific in September, but owns a 9.75 ERA this
spring and has not made his manager happy. Gunderson has a 1.64 ERA
for the spring but has a reputation for losing his effectiveness in
the second half of the season. The Rangers are waiting for
Patterson to recover the form he showed two seasons ago, before
elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistency and resiliency is what we need to see,'' Oates
said. ``There's no Xavier Hernandez out there to help those guys
this year. They may have to pitch back-to-back days, and to do
that, they're going to have to keep their pitch counts down. We
can't afford good-game, bad-game either. They have to be more
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so forget getting a starter. How about merely a serviceable
reliever?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's anybody out there better than a guy
like Jeff Zimmerman \R15 innings, one walk this spring\S,'' Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then why, pray tell, is he in Oklahoma City?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching,'' Gonzalez said the other day before the Rangers
left Florida. ``We need pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Patterson, falling behind hitters, inherited a
3-3 tie with the Astros in the seventh inning last night and gave
up a run before striking out Richard Hidalgo and Mitch Meluskey
with the bases loaded to escape further trouble. It wasn't the
low-pitch-count inning Oates had hoped to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long season,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   And a long wait until July.

MARTINEZ A HITTING MARVEL WITH NO SIGNS OF SLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ ``Edgar gave me great advice,'' Mariners
shortstop Alex Rodriguez was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know what, take full advantage of your youth
because age takes a toll on you. You don't want to ever be 35 years
old and saying, man, I could have stolen bases, I could have been
diving for balls.' He said, `Do it all when you're young, because
when you're older it's a lot more difficult.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That made a lot of sense to me. By having a great work ethic
when you're young, your body will be much better when you're older,
and it's hard to start something when you're 30 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As Edgar Martinez enters his 13th season in Seattle, he doesn't
like being reminded that he's 36 years old. He will let teammate
David Segui muss his hair and tease him about going gray _ even if
he's not _ but the M's dignified designated hitter won't concede
anything to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself old,'' Martinez said. ``I'm 36; that's
still young to play this game. It doesn't matter if you're 20, 25,
30 or 35, you can be in great shape. Age will affect you, but if
you're in great shape you can still play like you're young.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Martinez's youth was lost roaming the ranks of the
Mariners' minor leagues. He didn't become a big-league regular
until he was 27 years old, and a new study shows he could be the
best ``late bloomer'' of the last quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's ``Baseball Scoreboard,'' STATS Inc. studied every
player since 1950 who didn't receive regular playing time until
after turning 27. Maury Wills, Hal McRae and Minnie Minoso top the
career hits list among qualifying players, but Martinez already
ranks ninth. With two more quality seasons, he would jump to fourth
_ and first among players whose careers began in the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's something of a dubious honor, calling attention to years
spent toiling in oblivion. Those seasons don't necessarily give
Martinez greater appreciation for all he's accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some long years down there,'' he said, simply.
</P>
<P>
   But it does point out, and perhaps accentuate, what Martinez is
doing at an age when most are winding down. Last year was his
fourth consecutive season with an average above .320 and more than
25 homers, 100 runs batted in and 100 walks.
</P>
<P>
   When former Mariners catcher John Marzano joined the Rangers
this year, his new teammates bombarded him with questions about
Seattle's hitters. The first guy they asked about wasn't Rodriguez
or Ken Griffey Jr. It was Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the great hitters over there wanted to know about him,''
Marzano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great reputation around baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a professional hitter,'' said the Chicago White Sox's
Frank Thomas, the only active player with a better career on-base
percentage than Martinez's .424. ``He's been great for a long time,
very consistent, steady. He's got a level swing, knows his
strengths and weaknesses. He stays with his strengths and makes
adjustments, and that's hard to do at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's staying power has much to do with conditioning.
Mariners trainer Rick Griffin said Martinez is in better overall
shape this year than in the past two or three years, mostly because
he changed his workout routine. Instead of lifting heavy weights,
Martinez now lifts lighter weights with more repetitions, lending
greater flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said because Martinez doesn't play in the field, his
legs are saved from the pounding others experience. That's
important, because players last only as long as their legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs go,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``I played until I
was 40, and my thought process was better than it had ever been. I
just couldn't get to the ball anymore with consistency. It's your
legs that get you out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez thinks it's more mental than anything else. He would
like to play one or two more years, but without a contract past
this season, he's taking his future a year at a time. What is
important now, he says, is that he is still having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to look back and regret that you didn't enjoy
it,'' Martinez said. ``That's important; you don't want to say, `I
should have had more fun.' Sometimes I stressed out about the game
too much. When I made bad plays in the field, it really bothered me
for a while and it carried over into the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to be able to relax, forget about that game
and move on. I still (stress) sometimes, but I think it's less than
before _ a lot less than before. I guess if it gets to a point
where I don't enjoy the game as much, it's probably time to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel it. You just know. If you're coming to the ballpark
every day and you don't feel excited about the game, it might be
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez's time comes, he hopes the jersey he hangs up is a
Mariner one. He would seem to have earned the right to play as long
as he wishes in Seattle, but he knows that might not be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in baseball today, that's pretty difficult,'' Martinez
said. ``Anybody would be so thrilled to have that choice and so
appreciative of that choice, but that's really for very special
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Very special players? Martinez would seem to qualify.

O'NEAL SITS, STEWS DOWN STRETCH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Shaquille O'Neal loved everything about Glen Rice's
game-winning 17-foot jumper on Friday. Everything except his
vantage point on the play.
</P>
<P>
   He watched the dramatic swish from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   And sitting out the crucial final seconds of a one-point game
didn't sit well with him.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis lifted O'Neal for Robert Horry to put a
smaller, swifter, defensive unit on the floor. On offense, Rambis
worried the Suns would try to send O'Neal to the foul line, where
he's shooting 54.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the strategy, it didn't make sense to O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (anything),'' O'Neal said. The defensive strategy
``makes sense.... But nothing else really makes sense. But I guess
I don't know what the (heck) I'm doing, so I just go with the
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's second-leading scorer made this much clear: He wants
to be on the floor with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I do. I guess it shows what type of confidence people
have in me. But we won the game, so it don't matter,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis subbed out O'Neal in favor of Horry with 48.9 seconds
left and the Los Angeles Lakers up by three points. He sent O'Neal
back in with 37.8 seconds left, then pulled him again for the final
offensive play with 11.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of, defensively, putting a unit out there
that we could switch everything. That's how I looked at it,''
Rambis said. ``I put a smaller unit out there ... and that ended up
being very good for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the offensive side ... we were worried about ... Shaq
getting the ball and (the Suns) fouling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting O'Neal in the fourth quarter ended in a loss a week
earlier, against Sacramento. But this time, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great move, I guess,'' O'Neal said. ``It's cool, we
won the game. It's all about winning. Nothing else matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ousted: Rick Fox, who's had a hot shooting hand off the bench
lately, shot off his mouth instead Friday, and paid the price,
getting ejected in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was limited by two early fouls and had scored just three
points. With 18.5 seconds left in the third, he was called for an
illegal, out-of-bounds screen and his vociferous protest drew two
quick technical fouls, and an automatic ejection, from referee Ted
Bernhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, official Joey Crawford tossed the
Suns' Chris Morris for grousing, and coach Danny Ainge had to
restrain him from going after Crawford.

RUSSIAN BOY FINDS HOPE IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Holding the lollipop between two knotted fingers,
Denis Nefedova tore the wrapper off with his teeth in one deft move
_ proving Friday that he's adapted to the horrible burns that cost
him much of the use of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the maneuver revealed something else _ that the 10-year-old
from far-off Sakhalin Island in Russia is still just a typical kid.
</P>
<P>
   With childlike resilience and optimism, he's actually looking
forward to the coming year of surgeries and treatments he'll start
Monday at the Grossman Burn Center of Sherman Oaks Hospital and
Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried, not even a little bit,'' the boy said through
a translator. ``Everybody is so kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Denis' case came to the attention of Dr. Michael Pomo of North
Hollywood, who was volunteering his services on Sakhalin Island.
Pomo contacted Dr. A. Richard Grossman, the burn center's founder,
who agreed to donate his services and helped get a $50,000
contribution from the Children's Burn Foundation of Sherman Oaks to
defray costs.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes of Denis' mother, Janna, 32, continually moisten when
she gazes at her son, at Grossman, or at the others helping Denis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will hope for miracles to happen,'' she said through
translator Mila Chernetsky, a medical biller in Grossman's office.
</P>
<P>
   An accident at the family home last year ignited gasoline fumes
that blew up in Denis' face, melting his skin and scarring his head
and hands.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in his hometown and in Moscow did what they could, but
last week the boy and his mother came to the United States seeking
what they called a miracle at the world-famous burn center in
Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Denis will start surgery on his face, the first step
in what could be a yearlong rehabilitation for the cheerful boy
with the bright, green eyes, just like his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to do the face first, so he can get back into
schooling and get some interpersonal contact,'' Grossman said.
``The big thing is when he looks in the mirror he won't feel so bad
about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   While he talked, Grossman held and stroked Denis' gnarled hands,
and brushed the child's brown bangs with his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The child gives away no trace of self-consciousness about his
scars, and insists he's eager about his imminent medical odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   His mother has realistic expectations, according to Chernetsky,
the translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows he'll never be 100 percent,'' Chernetsky said. ``But
she also knows from people that Dr. Grossman can do unbelievable
things, and she knows he'll do everything he can for Denis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so overcome by emotions that it's very difficult for her
to express her feelings for all the help and the good wishes, not
only from newly found friends, but from the hospital and the burn
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Nefedova works as a police detective in their hometown,
Korsakov, a city of 30,000 on Sakhalin Island, just north of Japan.
Her husband, Andre, serves in the Russian coast guard.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the accident, his mother dropped Denis off from
school and returned to work, leaving him at home alone. She
returned in 40 minutes to check on him, but by then disaster had
struck.
</P>
<P>
   As daylight faded, Denis decided to light a candle to brighten
the family's small apartment _ darkened by one of the frequent
power outages in the city.
</P>
<P>
   To circumvent gasoline shortages, the family kept fuel cans in
the hallway. Denis' candle tipped over and ignited the fumes,
engulfing the boy in a searing flash.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor heard the explosion and broke open a window to call
the boy. Dazed and badly hurt, Denis stumbled to the window and was
rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But Sakhalin Island has no burn specialists, so no plastic
surgeons were available in the crucial early days of his treatment.
After two months of treatment on the island, and two more at more
advanced facilities in Moscow, Russian efforts had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said he wants to trim the scar tissue from Denis' face
and graft on skin from his leg, which is more elastic and will
allow him more normal expressions and movement. He also plans to
reconstruct the boy's nose, then get to work on his hands. He'll
graft more flexible skin there, also, and try to give him back his
opposable thumbs. They're now useless, stiffened by scar tissue,
Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Nefedovas' household income is only $80 a month,
neighbors on the island pitched in for plane fare for Denis and his
mother. Andre Nefedova stayed home to keep working.
</P>
<P>
   Now Denis' American caretakers are looking for Russian-speaking
families who can house the family in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Pomo's sister, Diane K. Barackman of North Hollywood, met the
Nefedovas at the airport last week. She presented Denis with a
stuffed lion, telling him the king of the jungle represents
courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``How interesting. I was born under the sign of the lion,'' said
the boy, who will turn 11 on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday they made the requisite trip to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been his life's dream, to go on a roller coaster,'' the
Russian name for which translates to ``American hill,'' Janna
Nefedova said.
</P>
<P>
   Barackman said when they arrived, she asked Denis, ``Shall we
stop and eat?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nyet! Nyet!'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   She first took him to the Tiki Room, with its talking
animatronic birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, Thank you. Can we go on the roller coaster now?''
</P>
<P>
   And his favorite ride?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Chernetsky promised, will be a trip to Magic Mountain. But
Nefedova stressed she wanted no part of the imposing roller
coasters there.
</P>
<P>
   Denis can't contain his excitement, though. And seeing her son's
glee, Nefedova allows a broad smile to cross her face.

VIGIL HELD FOR POW

<P>
   EAST LOS ANGELES _ The mother of captured U.S. Army Staff Sgt.
Andrew Ramirez joined friends, family and well-wishers in prayer
Friday night at a candlelight vigil in the neighborhood where he
grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Trembling as she spoke, Vivian Ramirez thanked the community for
their flowers, prayers and phone calls. She said it has reinforced
her faith in the safe return of her son, a cavalry scout captured
with two other American soldiers Wednesday in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``(ITAL) Mi hijo (END ITAL), I love you. I wish you were here,''
Ramirez said as she stood before the crowd of about 200 outside the
AltaMed Community Health Clinic. ``I hope you're well, and I'm
waiting for you to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's sister, Nadine, 34, who also attended the vigil, said
her anxious family has been grateful for the outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank everybody. We're just very worried for my
brother, and we want him to come home. He'll be strong, and he'll
be happy to see my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned relatives, friends and neighbors of the 24-year-old
Schurr High School graduate spent the day in prayer and worry
Friday, consoling one another and watching for updates on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Ramirez said that the Pentagon and the International Red
Cross contacted her Friday morning, telling her they planned to see
her son, so they can check his wounds and evaluate how badly he is
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ask for more,'' Vivian Ramirez said. ``They are doing
the best that they can. Hopefully, it will be over soon, and he can
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   While more and more yellow ribbons were tied to trees and fences
in support of Ramirez, the family's concerns intensified with news
about the three POWs coming under the Yugoslavian government's
military trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is bracing for anything. Anything can happen,''
Frank Jasso, the great-uncle of Ramirez, said at the family home at
716 S. Eastmont Ave., in East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But family members said the community's support has given them
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``My spirit has gone up; I have more faith that he will be
coming home soon,'' Vivian Ramirez said at the prayer vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead hung a 25-foot banner covered with messages written by
supporters, such as ``May God bless you in your safe return home''
and ``All of us are praying for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's mother said she sent her imprisoned son a letter,
telling him how much she loves him, and she hopes to get a reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him everyone in the world is praying for him and the
other soldiers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Galaz, pastor at the family's church, St.
Alphonsus in East Los Angeles, led the prayers at the candlelight
vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We light these candles here symbolizing our unity with each
other and with Andrew and his companions,'' Galaz said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Hilda Solis, D-El Monte, said she would introduce a
resolution in the Senate on Monday recognizing Sgt. Ramirez's
bravery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your son is fighting for our freedom,'' Solis told Ramirez's
mother at the vigil. ``I know this is a tremendous, tremendous
hardship for a family that is grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Ramirez spoke of her brother's commitment to join the
military and later become a police officer, following in the
footsteps of her other brother, Steve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be in the service since junior high,'' she said.
``That's just what he wanted to do. He wanted to be a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ramirez, 31, a detective at the Los Angeles Police
Department's Van Nuys Division, attended the vigil but did not
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca praised Ramirez for his
courage and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of your son Andrew Ramirez who is standing
up for protecting people across the world,'' Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina said the show of
community support was crucial at this uncertain time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to extend our prayers to these three brave young
men,'' she said. ``We are honored by the work they are doing to
bring peace to that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Padron, 24, a close friend of Ramirez in junior high
school, came to the vigil to show his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in my thoughts and in my prayers, and may God bless him
and bring him home quickly and safe,'' Padron said of his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Chow, 22, of Montebello said he hoped the gathering sends
a message that Ramirez is beloved in his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets the world see our support. He's not just another
soldier on the field; he has family and friends,'' Chow said.
</P>
<P>
   East Los Angeles businesses and residents displayed yellow
ribbons on their storefronts and yards.
</P>
<P>
   An alumni wrestling club from Ramirez's graduating high school
class at Schurr High School visited the Ramirez home Friday to drop
off flowers, a wrestling shirt and a letter to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers, candles, a Holy Bible and a large sign that read
``Bring Andy Home'' were left at the front gate of the family home
where Ramirez loyally returns on his breaks from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, Ramirez's father, Andrew Ramirez Sr., 50,
returned to feed his five dogs, including Max, his son's Doberman
mix.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Frankie, said Andy Sr. was ``in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Lt. Anthony Alba said he was trying Friday to
obtain blown-up photos of the three POWs to circulate at all LAPD
stations for employees and visitors to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are former military. We all obviously hope that
they're released in good condition,'' Alba said.

RICE LIFTS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Strange evening in the Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   A cross-dressing tattooed guy with bright yellowish hair running
around the arena, a fellow cross-dresser and alleged sex offender
broadcasting the game from midcourt, a handful of testy officials
handing out ejections left and right...
</P>
<P>
   And amid all the oddities, the most normal event of the night
was a game-winning shot by a guy who was too sick to practice for
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing abnormal, or the slightest bit sick, with
Glen Rice's treasured shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   Though suffering from a bad cold for three days, Rice posted his
best performance since joining the Los Angeles Lakers, scoring 23
points and the game-winning 17-foot baseline jumper with 7.1
seconds left for a 91-90 victory Friday at sold-out America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The shot no doubt evoked a trademark ``Yessss!'' from TNT
announcer Marv Albert at courtside.
</P>
<P>
   It also brought on an impromptu dance session along the Lakers
bench, as they celebrated their first three-game winning streak
since early March _ about the same time they scrambled the roster
by acquiring Rice from Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' Rice said. ``Like I've always told people,
once my legs get up under me, it's gonna be a big advantage for
this team.... I want the ball when the game is on the line, and I
wanna do whatever I can to get this team over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will argue with him.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has been up and down since coming to the Lakers, having
arrived out of shape from a 10-month layoff. And the illness the
past two days looked like a setback. Instead, he hit 10 of 16 shots
and 3 of 6 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Shaquille O'Neal ordered up when he made his plea
for a shooting ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' O'Neal said. ``I'm glad we got a deadly shooter
like Glen Rice, and I'm glad I'm the general manager of this team.
I've got my team just the way I want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even better than he wanted. The less-heralded part of the
trade, J.R. Reid, came up with 14 points off the bench, including
10 in the second quarter as the Lakers took a 44-38 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   But it went down to the wire anyway. The potent Suns whittled
down several Lakers leads behind offensive outbursts from Clifford
Robinson (game-high 30 points) and Jason Kidd's 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix only took the lead just three times all night, and
briefly, but the last one nearly stuck when Kidd converted a
3-point play with 11.3 seconds left. Kidd scored the fastbreak
layup and drew a foul from Derek Harper to put Phoenix up, 90-89.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' inbounds play could have gone to Kobe Bryant at the
top of the arc, or to Harper, but Robert Horry made eye contact
with Rice, who broke free to take the pass. He dribbled to the
baseline, gave a quick fake to Danny Manning and hit the open shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He buckled a little bit, and I just rose up over him and shot
it,'' Rice said. ``It was a wide-open shot, I gotta hit that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns inbounded the ball with 7.1 seconds left, but the play
was disrupted when Manning was caught at the top of the key. George
McCloud, who had hurt the Lakers with his 3-point shooting, then
tossed up a 20-foot airball at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   After four tough games, and three wins, against the Suns, the
Lakers have gotten used to scraping by. They lost a lead of as many
as 14 points Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to maintain the leads that we had,''
Rambis said. ``However, they're a team that's fully capable of
erasing a 20-point lead in six or seven minutes. So the fact we
held them off, that's what I was pleased with tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It left the Suns shaking their heads, wondering how to beat a
team that wins despite off nights from the likes of Bryant (7 for
20).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just a great team,'' Kidd said. ``You can only take
away one option, and they still have three more options.... You can
only hope that they have a bad game.''

<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ After nine days of hesitation,
NATO attacked the center of Yugoslavia's capital early Saturday
morning, destroying the headquarters of the security forces
carrying out President Slobodan Milosevic's offensive against the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Morini, Albania) _ With ethnic Albanian
refugees from Kosovo continuing to stream across the tiny mountain
border crossing here at the rate of more than 2,000 an hour,
officials said Friday that the week-old exodus is creating an
ominous humanitarian crisis. ``The situation is out of control. It
is catastrophic,'' the Albanian information minister, Musa Ulqini,
said Friday as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
declared, ``a major humanitarian emergency in northern Albania.''

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Blace, Macedonia) _ The flood of Kosovar
Albanians into Macedonia, an estimated 90,000 refugees since March
24, has completely overwhelmed the Macedonian authorities. Soldiers
were brought in to stem the flow along the railroad tracks, and
riot police armed with automatic weapons and wearing flak jackets
and helmets formed a barrier to block refugees from the main road.
By Carlotta Gall. With photo and map.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ Senior Clinton administration
officials say the United States will have to consider accepting
some of the tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees who have
fled Kosovo in recent days, if only to encourage reluctant European
nations to do the same. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton said Friday that
despite the continued campaign of repression by Slobodan Milosevic
and the mass exodus of refugees from Kosovo, the military and
political objectives of the western allies were still attainable.
By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TROOPS (Berlin) _ The situation of NATO forces based in
Macedonia appears to illustrate the contradictions in the West's
military plans. The forces are in Macedonia to reinforce a Kosovo
peace plan seemingly overtaken by events. The mission of the
Western troops in Macedonia has already changed once, from an
``extraction force'' for the 1,500 officials of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe who were in Kosovo until the
bombing began, to a force to carry out any possible peace accord.
By Roger Cohen. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-WEATHER (Washington) _ There has been fog and rain over
Yugoslavia for most of NATO's 10-day air campaign, but politicians
and their assessment of public sensitivities have grounded just as
many bombing runs as has the weather. By Eric Schmitt. With
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ Credibility in military news
briefings is everything, and the lack of it in the early days of
the Vietnam war was one reason why the American public soured
against involvement. But instead of providing details on allied
bombing missions, spokesmen for the alliance here have been issuing
heated daily denunciations of the Yugoslav anti-Albanian campaign
in Kosovo, a campaign that the allied military command itself
acknowledges the bombing has so far been unable to stop. By Craig
R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-HUNGER (Beijing) _ The food scarcity engulfing North
Korea will intensify in the next two months because the government
rations on which a majority of the population depends are running
out, a senior U.N. aid official said Friday. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   ALGERIA-JOURNALISTS (Algiers, Algeria) _ Omar Bellouchet's name
is not on the ballot for the presidential election on April 15, an
election that many of Algeria's voters see as a gateway to
democracy. But many Algerians consider him and others like him at
least as important to hopes of freedom as any of the presidential
candidates. Bellouchet, 46, is editor in chief of El Watan (The
Nation), the most spirited of a dozen independent newspapers that
have sprung up. He has been a champion of liberties that Algerians
have been denied by a repressive oligarchy of generals and
bureaucrats. By John F. Burns. With photo.

   MELISSA-VIRUS (Trenton, N.J.) _ Federal and state authorities
arrested a central New Jersey man Thursday night and and charged
him with originating the e-mail virus known as Melissa. By David
Kocieniewski.
</P>
<P>
   BISHOPS-DEATH-PENALTY (Undated) _ The nation's Roman Catholic
bishops issued a statement against the death penalty, their first
in 19 years. It draws on Pope John Paul II's recent
anti-death-penalty statement in St. Louis. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   MACDOUGAL-TRIAL (Little Rock, Ark.) _ Two parts of the
wide-ranging investigation of President Clinton converged here
Friday, when a woman testified in behalf of a former business
partner of the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton. By Steve
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   NH-SCHOOL-TAX (Undated) _ New Hampshire no longer seems such a
granite monolith of anti-tax sentiment. It is one of only two
states without an income or sales tax. But there are signs that the
``Live Free or Die'' sentiment that is emblazoned on New
Hampshire's license plates, and that has long influenced the
state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary, may be mellowing.
By Carey Goldberg. With photo.

<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY (Moved in ``k'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LEWIS-COLUMN (New York) _ U.S. policy toward the terrorism of
Slobodan Milosevic has been constrained in the past by our public's
wariness of military involvement abroad. But that
political-psychological calculus may have changed under the impact
of the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo. Most Americans do not want to
temporize with Milosevic. We want to finish the job. By Anthony
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The nation's jobless rate dropped in
March to its lowest level in 29 years, the Labor Department
reported Friday, falling from 4.4 percent in February to 4.2
percent in the latest of many signs that the labor market in the
United States remains remarkably robust. But in a break from the
feverish hiring of the last three years, American companies added
far fewer new workers to their payrolls last month than had been
typical lately. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-INDEPENDENTS (Undated) _ Independent oil companies account
for 40 percent of the oil produced in the United States. While they
have seen many downturns, the last year has hit them particularly
hard. Their problems make it unlikely that domestic production,
which hit a 50-year low last month, will recover soon. By Agis
Salpukas. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SWEDEN-WALLENBERG (Stockholm, Sweden) _ Since the mid-19th
century, Swedish industry has been largely synonymous with the
Wallenberg family. The dynasty's tentacles reach everywhere, from
heavy trucks and mobile phones at home to board rooms in the United
States. But like Sweden itself, the Wallenberg business empire is
under siege these days. By Alan Cowell. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   CREDIT (New York) _ A smaller-than-expected increase in nonfarm
payroll jobs last month set off the bond market's best rally in
four weeks on Friday. The bond market is normally closed on Good
Friday, but trading occurred until noon. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-TRAVEL (Undated) _ These are truly boom times for the
nation's airlines: Their earnings are stronger than ever, and they
flew a record 611 million passengers last year without a single
fatality. They did so while maintaining their on-time performance
and without a significant increase in officially registered
complaints. So successful, and yet, by many accounts, they have
never been so unloved. By Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SPEND (Shanghai, China) _ Worried about slowing export
growth, falling foreign investment and declining domestic demand,
Beijing spent nearly $200 billion on public construction projects
last year and plans to do the same this year. By Seth Faison. With

fine. By Richard Sandomir.

DODGERS BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It sure didn't look much different than any
other year.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday night, indeed, marked the end of the Freeway Series,
the significance seemed to be lost on the fans as the Los Angeles
Dodgers knocked off the Anaheim Angels 8-1 in front of 28,405 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance was sparse, the crowd mostly subdued _ many left
early, as usual _ and the atmosphere was relatively tame for an
Angel-Dodgers game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because the annual series has lost some of its
luster since the teams now play one another during the regular
season in interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, there didn't seem to be many who were broken
up over the issue, although nothing has been finalized for possible
future exhibition meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The first inning of Friday's game at least appeared to have
plenty of fireworks. Eric Young singled off Angels right-hander Ken
Hill to open the game, moving to third on another single by Todd
Hundley, who finished 3 for 4 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps trying to make a statement regarding his new catcher's
health, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson kept Hundley in the game into
the eighth inning. Hundley's longest catching stint during spring
training prior to Friday was five innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Hill struck out Gary Sheffield, Raul Mondesi singled off
the glove of third baseman Troy Glaus to score Young for the first
run.
</P>
<P>
   Hill then struck out former Angel Devon White for the second
out, but Eric Karros followed with his fourth homer of the spring,
a three-run blast to left for a 4-0 Dodgers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shaky start, Hill struck out the side when he
retired Todd Hollandsworth for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   Hill actually settled down to pitch effectively over the final
three of his four innings of work, a trend the Angels hope he'll
continue into the season. Hill allowed only a hit, a walk and no
runs in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Angels responded in the bottom of the first
inning _ albeit without the same firepower the Dodgers displayed _
and got a key contribution from an expected source.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, in his first Edison Field at-bat as an Angel, smacked
a 2-1 pitch from Ismael Valdes for a towering home run to center,
setting off a celebration scene the Angels hope is repeated with
frequency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who signed a six-year, $80-million deal with the Angels
in the offseason, had not hit a spring homer until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were a pretty good team the last two years,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said before the game, ``but you take
one of the best players in the game and put him in the middle of
our lineup and you get a whole lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer to Vaughn turned out to be one of the few blemishes
for Valdes, who has had a strong spring for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander pitched five innings Friday, allowing only two
hits and striking out four. Valdes, who was 3-0 with a 1.37 spring
ERA coming into the game, finished off his effort by retiring 13
consecutive Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored another run in the fifth and two more in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's flair single to left with the infield in brought home
Adrian Beltre, who had doubled, with the fifth run.
</P>
<P>
   A Hollandsworth tapper in front of the plate scored Tripp Cromer
in the eighth and a single by Grudzielanek brought in Trenidad
Hubbard to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left-hander Onan Masaoka struck out the side in the
eighth, working his way out of a bases-loaded jam to quell one of
the Angels' few threats.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It sure didn't look much different than any
other year.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday night, indeed, marked the end of the Freeway Series as
we know it, the significance seemed to be lost as the Los Angeles
Dodgers knocked off the Anaheim Angels 8-1 in front of 28,405 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance was sparse, the crowd mostly subdued _ many left
early, as usual _ and the atmosphere was relatively tame for an
Angels-Dodgers game.
</P>
<P>
   Even Angels manager Terry Collins, who was irritated earlier
this spring when talking about the demise of the series, seemed
resigned to what might happen in the future _ although he'd prefer
things to be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a traditionalist like everyone else and I think tradition
in baseball is starting to fade,'' Collins said. ``Sure, we'd love
to play the Dodgers two more times, but I don't begrudge them
wanting to play the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for some reason this turns out to be the last game .. Maybe
the game at one time meant more, since we play during the season
now. Those games in June are the ones that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The first inning of Friday's game appeared to have plenty of
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros smacked a three-run homer off Angels right-hander
Ken Hill and Todd Hundley singled to help start the four-run rally
on his way to a 3-for-4 night with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps trying to make a statement regarding his new catcher's
health, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson kept Hundley in the game into
the eighth inning, his longest stint by three innings during what
has been a slow-starting spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a really good test, but we'll see how he is
tomorrow,'' Johnson said of Hundley. ``He passed it today with
flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who also had an RBI and scored two runs, was equally
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legs feel fresh and that was the main thing,'' Hundley
said. ``The elbow's been fine. It was just getting the legs in
shape. It's a `good tired' I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Angels responded in the bottom of the first
inning _ albeit without the same firepower the Dodgers displayed _
getting a key contribution from an expected source.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, in his first Edison Field at-bat as an Angel, smacked
a 2-1 pitch from Ismael Valdes for a towering 430-foot home run to
center, his first of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it was high enough,'' Collins said, noting the recent
changes in field dimensions at Edison Field didn't matter on this
drive. ``When he's swinging like that, he can hit them out of any
part of any park.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's turned out to be one of the few blemishes for Valdes,
who has had a strong spring for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander pitched five innings Friday, allowing only two
hits and striking out four. Valdes, now 4-0 this spring allowing
only four earned runs in 242/3 innings, finished off his effort by
retiring 13 consecutive Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored another run in the fifth and two more in the
eighth.
</P>

spring, struck out the side in the eighth, working his way out of a
bases-loaded jam to quell one of the Angels' few threats.

PORK POUNDING DODGER FANS LEAD NATION IN HOT DOG CONSUMPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Whether or not the Los Angeles Dodgers bring home
the bacon this season, their fans are already expected to merit one
savory distinction.
</P>
<P>
   The people who study these things _ in this case, the National
Hot Dog and Sausage Council _ say Dodger fans will down more dogs
than their counterparts at any other major league ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, between now and October, visitors to Dodger Stadium are
expected to swallow 2.2 million of the grilled and steamed links,
outpacing by nearly 50 percent the closest challenger, the
comparatively vegan crowd at Jacobs Field in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, strung end to end, the 10.25-inch
Dodger Dogs would create a meat string 356 miles long, able to
stretch from Dodger Stadium to an orbiting space shuttle with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really surprised us,'' said Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for
the Washington, D.C.-based meat council. ``We expected you in
California to live up to your reputation for being a little on the
crunchy side. But you're the most enthusiastic consumer of hot dogs
... in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping Los Angeles' ranking is that many East Coast ballparks
have expanded their menus to the point where a fan can buy
everything from a turkey wing to sushi while watching a game. Even
the Dodgers have experimented with broader fare, but the stadium's
concession menus still point clearly back to their Cracker
Jack-and-beer origins.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Americans will eat more than 20 billion weiners this
year, making Dodger Dogs a mere burp on the nation's meat screen.
Still, they account for nearly 10 percent of all hot dogs consumed
at the nation's 28 major league ballparks, Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   What's so special about the Dodger Dog?
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever had one, in Dodger Stadium?'' asked Ron Smith, a
spokesman for Vernon, Calif.,-based Farmer John, the Clougherty
Packing Co. division that makes Dodger Dogs. ``Then you have 75
percent of your answer right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer John makes the 100 percent pork hot dog specifically for
the Dodgers, with what it describes as ``eastern grown, western
flavored'' hogs. While the company produces extra-long dogs for
other commercial customers and for retail sale, Rupert Murdoch's
sport franchise owns the Dodger Dog trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are variations on the theme, a standard Dodger Dog
is first steamed, then grilled before serving, Smith said, creating
a charred but juicy taste combo. In addition, ``the Dodger Dog
still sticks out of the bun. That's the unique added value that
tickles your fancy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real secret weapon, however, has got to be Hall-of-Fame
sportscaster Vin Scully, whose avuncular voice extolling the virtue
of the Dodger Dog from a thousand transistor radios is enough to
weaken the resolve of even the staunchest bunny hugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin has always done the Farmer John commercials for baseball
and nobody does it like him,'' Smith said. While it is impossible
to quantify Scully's contribution to Dodger Dog sales, ``They go
hand in glove. And I'm not going to say which is the hand and which
is the glove. Who came first? They're inseparable.''

LOCKHEED TO SELL SITE WHERE COMPANY WAS BORN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Closing a book rich in this nation's military
history, Lockheed Martin Corp. said Friday that it has signed a
contract to sell a 103-acre manufacturing site in Burbank _ a major
hub in the home front World War II effort _ to a Los Angeles
developer.
</P>
<P>
   Terms with the Zelman Cos. were not announced but escrow should
close by year's end, said Gail Rymer, a spokeswoman at Bethesda,
Md.-based Lockheed's West Coast corporate office in Westlake
Village, Calif. The deal was concluded this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping it confidential and will let Zelman release it
when they are ready,'' Rymer said of the purchase price. Zelman's
offices were closed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank city officials have been working on development plans
for the property _ which borders the Golden State Freeway _ for
about eight years. Plans call for a $100 million office, retail and
hotel complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about it,'' Community Development Director Bob
Tague said of the sale. ``Zelman has a good reputation as a can-do
developer and hopefully we can get this project moving now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for a hotel on seven acres, car dealerships on 27
acres, a campus-style office park on 17 acres with the balance
devoted to big-box retailers, Tague said. Permits should be issued
this fall with the retail component open by November 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site was the birthplace of Lockheed when the company was
formed in the 1920s. Employment there peaked at 100,000 workers
during World War II, when the facility known as Plant B-1 built the
famous twin-tailed P-38 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed has spent several million dollars during the past eight
years on an environmental cleanup and that work continues.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed still owns a 32-acre site nearby that was most recently
the headquarters of Calstart, the advanced transportation
consortium. The company has about 5,200 people working at its Skunk
Works research facility in Palmdale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A previous deal to sell the property to Vestar Development Co.
of Phoenix collapsed when a December 1998 escrow deadline could not
be met. &QL;

BLAZERS TORPEDO SUB-SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Sonics point guard Gary Payton, known for his
brash mouth and intimidating scowl, was actually somber and nearly
sedated.
</P>
<P>
   Just how far have the Sonics fallen?
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's 107-95 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers
at the Rose Garden, the Sonics' record hit a low that has not been
seen since the 1990-91 season _ the last time the team owned a
sub-.500 record after 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' third straight road loss dropped them to 15-16. They
who are 4-12 away from KeyArena after finishing a
five-game-in-six-nights road trip with a 1-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   The dire circumstances were enough to flush out Payton, who has
mostly avoided the media the past month.
</P>
<P>
   He is stunned, baffled and weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think I'm going to be 15-16,'' Payton said. ``It's
hard for me to take right now.''
</P>
<P>
   What is even more difficult is the Sonics' plight. On the
horizon is Sunday's game against the Houston Rockets, another
Western Conference power.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, is how the Sonics finish out the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, who are barely holding on to the No. 7 seed in the
Western Conference, have 19 games left to scrap for a playoff spot
_ something that has been alien to this organization for eight
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have predicted this at the beginning of the
year,'' Hawkins said. ``With our talent and experience, we think
we're one of the more talented teams in the Western Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. The Sonics used to own the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Trail Blazers are staking claim.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, boasting the best record in the NBA at 25-6, by just
two points after three quarters. However, the Sonics could not
overcome a 13-point deficit with 2:25 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the Sonics make up for 11 fourth-quarter turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what is was, 11?,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal,
who was visibly astonished. ``You're not going to win too many
games with that. ... I like the fight we've shown. But that has to
get us some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Payton admits that it is tough to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about 11 of the team's 18 turnovers coming in the
final frame, Payton said: ``You see what kind of year we're having.
... I don't see a damn thing going right, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's 27 points and 13 assists led the Sonics, who overcame a
nine-point second-quarter deficit and an 11-point deficit in the
third to stay with the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The team trailed just 50-44 at halftime. They were fortunate to
be that close, considering the Sonics shot just 39 percent and were
out-rebounded 29-19 in the first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   What helped the Sonics was their aggressive start.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the trend of starting games sluggishly, the Sonics
matched Portland's intensity early. They ran with the young,
athletic Trail Blazers. The Sonics also banged the Trail Blazers,
who are big and deep at just about every position.
</P>
<P>
   Six points by rookie Vladimir Stepania helped the Sonics quickly
take an eight-point lead. He scored six of the team's first 12
points via open baseline jumpers. The Sonics took a 12-4 lead in
the first four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Portland, though, quickly heated up and shot 58 percent in the
first quarter behind Isaiah Rider's 13 points. The Sonics trailed
26-23 after the period, and played from behind most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blazers were fresher than we were,'' Westphal said. ``But
give them credit. Their bench played a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider led the Trail Blazers with 23 points. Portland had seven
players score in double figures, and its reserves outscored the
Sonics' reserves 32-15.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are still struggling without a firm presence in the
paint. Vin Baker has missed the past eight games with a partially
torn ligament in his right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The team is 3-5 so far without him. Perhaps the outcome of this
past week would have been different with Baker around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Payton said. ``That's 20 points over there.
That's an all-star. ... You see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether his team's record was a true indication of
its season, Westphal said: ``That's what our record is. If we don't
want to be considered a .500 team, we've got to get some
victories.''

   Blues Over Blue Moons
</P>
<P>
   That howling heard last week was probably just the neighborhood
dogs sounding off at the full moon, the second in March _ and thus,
by common understanding, a blue one. Then again, it could have been
a reaction to the disclosure by the venerable astronomy magazine
Sky &AMP; Telescope that the common understanding of blue moons was
based on a misunderstanding, perpetrated by the magazine 53 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Sky &AMP; Telescope writer with an apparently hazy memory was at
fault, the magazine said. Writing in 1946, he recalled a reference
to blue moons from an edition of the Maine Farmers' Almanac from
the 1930s. But his recollection was incomplete. ``He heard the
phrase `13 full moons in a year' and made, I'd guess you'd call it,
an error,'' said Donald Olson, a Texas astronomer who researched
the mistake. ``He inferred incorrectly that there must be a month
with two, and that the second of the month was called the blue
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what the almanac's editors were thinking, Olson
determined. To them, a blue moon was an extra moon in a season,
which normally has three. If the writer had checked the almanac, he
would have quickly realized the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Moon lovers can rest easy, however. They may have lost one blue
moon in March (and another in January, which had made this year a
two-blue-moon special), but they gained one in February 2000.

   A Crowd-Pleasing Campaign
</P>
<P>
   New York City transit officials had a short-lived and, in the
end, ill-advised idea to make the trains run on time: Ordering
subway conductors not to use the word ``please'' in announcements
over the public-address system. As in, ``Please stand clear of the
closing doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the officials dropped the idea in the face of protests from
riders. After all, even in New York there has been a trend toward
customer-friendly civility: Toll collectors have been ordered to
say, ``Thank you,'' and taxis blast cheery fasten-your-seat belt
reminders by celebrities like Sally Jessy Raphael and Paul Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   As for the subways, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
was trying to solve a system-wide problem arising from a boom in
ridership. No, not the problem of incomprehensible announcements.
(That remains a problem, though: The agency's own surveys indicate
that only 3 in 5 announcements come through loud and clear.) This
time, the issue was time: The MTA calculated that dropping the word
``please'' would save several seconds at each stop, or several
minutes on each run. Pressed to provide more service, the agency
saw shorter announcements as a way to clear the way for the next
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every second counts,'' said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the
transit agency. ``In some stations at some times of the day, it
would take longer to make the announcements than to get the
passengers on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule-conscious agency does not want conductors turning
mundane announcements into Shakespeare (``To close, or not to
close, that is the question''). So conductors are being told to
stick to the script, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're taking away, stylistically, is the freedom
conductors had to become flowery and descriptive,'' O'Leary said.

   Dow Finishes Above 10,000 Before Getting a Hangover
</P>
<P>
   The trek of the Dow Jones industrial average has looked like an
assault on Everest lately _ a steady march toward the summit for
its select group of 30 stocks, leaving most of the others behind at
base camp.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of near misses, the Dow finally finished above the
magical _ but essentially meaningless _ 10,000 level on Monday. The
achievement brought cheers on Wall Street and the biggest headline
in The Wall Street Journal since the outbreak of the gulf war. But
the celebration was short-lived: The index fell back on Tuesday and
finished the week at 9832, only slightly above its level a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most stocks remain far below record levels. Nearly 9
out of 10 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange are more
than 10 percent below their record highs. And on the same day the
Dow peaked, twice as many Big Board stocks fell to new lows as hit
new highs.

   Pleas in Diallo Case
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of protests calling for their arrest and indictment,
the four New York City police officers whose 41 shots killed an
unarmed African immigrant Feb. 4 were suspended from duty and
arraigned on charges of second-degree murder and reckless
endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers _ Edward McMellon, Sean Carroll, Kenneth Boss
and Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming
from the death of Amadou Diallo. Bronx District Attorney Robert
Johnson, demanded that the officers be put in custody, but the
judge set bail at $100,000 each, which the officers posted. Now the
real waiting begins: it could be a year or longer before a trial
starts.

   $81 Million Smoking Verdict
</P>
<P>
   In another legal setback for the tobacco industry, an Oregon
state jury awarded $81 million to the family of a man who smoked
Marlboro cigarettes for 40 years before his death.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a California state jury ordered the Philip Morris
Companies, the maker of Marlboro, to pay $51.5 million in another
case brought by a smoker. Both awards involved largely punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The release of damaging tobacco company documents in recent
years is cited by experts as one factor behind the verdicts. And
analysts predict more legal setbacks for producers in the future.

   Prison for Baptist Leader
</P>
<P>
   The former president of the National Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest black religious organization, was sentenced to
five and a half years in prison for swindles that brought him more
than $4 million during his tenure. The Rev. Henry Lyons, 57, who
was also ordered to repay almost $2.5 million, was convicted in
February of selling bogus convention membership lists to companies
seeking to do business with the group's members.
</P>
<P>
   He was also convicted of stealing nearly $250,000 donated by a
Jewish organization to rebuild Southern black churches destroyed by
arson. Apologizing for that crime, Lyons told the judge, ``It
stinks in God's nostrils, and I know it stinks in the law's
nostrils, and it stinks in mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts on Bottled Water
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend about $4 billion a year on bottled water. Is it
worth it? Not from the standpoint of purity or healthfulness, says
the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   The group tested about a thousand bottles of water, sampling
more than a hundred brands. While most of the water was fine, in
many bottles the tests detected traces of microbial or chemical
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap
water,'' the council said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The group is seeking tougher regulations and better labeling.

   Sony Gives Up on 007
</P>
<P>
   In a James Bond caper with a decidedly 1990s twist, the prize
was not a nuclear bomb, or killer satellite, but _ what else? _ a
movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures Entertainment announced 18 months ago that it had
signed a deal to make new Bond films, essentially trying to grab a
piece of one of Hollywood's most lucrative and durable franchises
from its current home, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. The fighting was
furious, but now Sony Pictures has dropped its plans to pursue
Agent 007.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures received a net payment of $5 million to give up on
the franchise, and the elusive Bond escaped yet another diabolical
plot.

   Government Is Ready for Y2K
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of subtle pressure and public exhortation,
a White House official named John Koskinen has galvanized a small
army of federal computer managers to get their machines in shape
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen reports that 92 percent of the government's critical
computer systems are free of year 2000 problems. And he predicts
that the laggards will fix their computers so Medicare and Medicaid
claims can be paid on time and air traffic controllers can guide
planes safely into the new year.

   BERLIN _ All is dark again in southeast Europe. Close your eyes
and those long lines of ragged ethnic Albanian refugees traipsing
out of Kosovo fuse with so many other processions of the Balkan
bedraggled: 1 million Greeks out of Turkey in 1923, 500,000 Turks
out of Greece in the same year, over 750,000 Muslims out of Bosnia
in 1992, and 175,000 Serbs out of Croatia in 1995. Where will it
end?
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, confusion seemed
absolute. A war begun to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to agree to a peace plan offering autonomy to Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians had become a battle to stop him from evicting all
those Albanians under cover of the mayhem of NATO's bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO air campaign with limited goals about a place the size of
Connecticut had begun to look like a full-scale war whose true
target was Milosevic _ and whose potential to spread to Macedonia
and Albania seemed real as more than 200,000 Kosovo refugees
staggered across their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Another somber possibility was that the alliance itself could be
threatened by the ignominy of failure on the eve of what had been
billed as a glorious 50th birthday party this month at a gathering
in Washington. ``The credibility of the alliance has been heavily
damaged,'' commented Christoph Bertram in the German weekly Die
Zeit. ``And it is a bitter irony that in the beginning it was
concern for this credibility that was the decisive factor behind
the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   That attack has now gained an unpredictable momentum. ``To say
we are not at war seems to me a statement too ridiculous even to
refute,'' said Gen. William Odom of the Hudson Institute. ``And
wars, as von Clausewitz noted, are acts of force to compel our
enemies to do our will. So let's get on with it before the
president inadvertently tears up our alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   But America's will seemed unclear, even on such fundamental
issues as whether to terrorize or talk to Milosevic, and what
degree of independence Kosovo should have.
</P>
<P>
   A number of outcomes now seem possible, but one trend is
inescapable: The history of the Balkans since the beginning of the
19th century is broadly that of the emergence of nation states.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, and
later the multinational state of Yugoslavia, smaller countries of
peoples claiming the same language, religion and culture have
emerged. The process began with Greece, which rose against the
Ottomans in 1821 and gained independence in 1930. More recently,
the process has brought the establishment of Slovenia and Croatia
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the intermittently bloody unscrambling of mixed
populations who often had scant sense of ``nationality'' has been
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The trend seems unlikely to stop. It suggests that the
truncated, surviving Yugoslav federation is unlikely to fare better
than its far larger predecessor. One day, Kosovo and Montenegro
will probably go their own ways, allowing Serbia, at last, to
proclaim itself once more a nation state, as it was in the 19th
century. But in the interim, many scenarios seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   The first critical issue, officials said, is whether to keep a
diplomatic channel open to Milosevic that might permit some
salvaging of an accord on autonomy for Kosovo. For now, the channel
remains, meager and reduced further by each new reported Serbian
atrocity against the ethnic Albanians, but not entirely abandoned.
``We have yet to make the final break,'' said Ron Neitzke, the
former deputy chief of mission in Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no clear decision has been made to go for
Milosevic's overthrow. Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, a top NATO
general, did say that ``we clearly intend to loosen his grip on
power and break his will to continue.'' But only with Saturday's
bombing of the Serbian Interior Ministry in Belgrade did the
alliance begin to appear ready to place Milosevic's jugular in its
sights.
</P>
<P>
   What could further radicalize this NATO approach? Perhaps a
revelation of large-scale Serbian executions of the many missing
ethnic Albanian men of fighting age. Or gross Serbian mistreatment
of the three U.S. soldiers captured last week.
</P>
<P>
   Another catalyst could be reliable intelligence suggesting that
resistance to Milosevic in the army and security forces is rising
fast, so that only a coup de grace is needed. Or a further
deepening of the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, NATO might intensify its bombing of Belgrade and
also bomb the Yugoslav fleet on the presumption that a navy without
a fleet is likely to get extremely restive. President Clinton could
turn up the propaganda war by appealing directly to the Serbian
people to rise against Milosevic because he has brought them to
ruin. Major resources could be invested in stirring Montengrin
restiveness, already strong.
</P>
<P>
   All these measures could undermine Milosevic. Whether they would
remove him is another matter. Milosevic has shown extraordinary
resilience even as he has unleashed waves of destruction. After so
much time, and so much propaganda, what democratic Serbian forces
may lie concealed in his shadow is unclear.

</P>
<P>
   What does seem clear, however, is that it will be
extraordinarily difficult for Kosovo's Albanian leaders to agree
now to any accord with the man who has terrorized them. In this
sense, Milosevic's removal may eventually favor a diplomatic
settlement structured around Kosovan autonomy, at least as a first
stage, or a Serbian-Albanian partition of the province.
</P>
<P>
   But as Richard Holbrooke, who long negotiated with the Serbian
strongman, has observed, Milosevic ``likes to pull rabbits out of
his hat.'' He might free the U.S. prisoners in the hope that the
gesture will stimulate opposition to NATO's bombing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He could try to work on the Greeks and Italians, who have
wavered in their support of the war. He could turn up the
propaganda of Serbian suffering in the hope that the once-pacifist
Green Party, now part of the German government, rediscovers its
roots and brings down the coalition of Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   None of these strategies seems likely to work. But what may
favor Milosevic, and undermine Western unity, is a widespread sense
that NATO has made serious errors. Political goals have been
constantly reformulated since the bombing began. A war to save an
international plan for autonomy formed at Rambouillot, France, may
be destroying that plan once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Most profoundly, NATO's efforts to take on new roles of crisis
management while avoiding the commitment of ground troops may be
the biggest risk. History does not suggest that air power alone can
drive out an army. The longer the conflict goes on, the more
strains in the alliance could emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton has looked unusually determined of late.
The one million dead in Bosnia and Rwanda during the 1990s have
clearly had an effect on him. Where he long looked the other way in
Bosnia, he now seems ready to fight for Western values and against
the repetitive destruction wreaked on Europe by Milosevic in
Croatia, in Bosnia and now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week at the Norfolk Naval Air Station, the
President said he was determined to make Milosevic ``pay the price
of aggression and murder.'' He asked whether America could look the
other way ``as entire peoples in Europe are forced to abandon their
homelands or die.'' He said America could not stop every tragedy
but that this did not mean it should ``do nothing for no one.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still seemed entrenched in his rejection of the use of
ground troops, and that position may not hold over time. If
negotiation is impossible with Milosevic, the only way to ram home
the message may be to mass troops and tanks in Macedonia, or even
use the new NATO member, Hungary, as a base from which to send the
alliance's immense armored divisions rumbling over the plains to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Would the American people support such a move? From the
slaughter of Muslims in Bosnia in 1992 to the ethnic cleansing of
Kosovo today, there is much devastating ammunition that could be
marshalled to move public opinion. But perhaps the most convincing
argument would be the simple one expressed by Robert Hunter, a
former United States ambassador to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Milosevic is in power, we are not going to have
stability,'' Hunter said. ``He's the last of the Communist thugs
and he's standing in the way of what we want to do in Europe. What
we want, as George Bush put it, is a Europe whole and free.''
</P>
<P>
   A Europe, in other words, where the little nation states of the
Balkans, including perhaps Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro, would
finally have completed the cycle of painful nation-building and
uprooting of populations begun so long ago. Then it might be free
to begin the long process of re-integration that has already made
irrelevant the border between two other former enemies in Europe,
Germany and France.

   If someone in Afghanistan were to title a cookbook ``The Koran
of Barbecue,'' it's a fair bet that the mullahs would show their
appreciation by employing its wisdom to roast the author himself on
the spit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things are different in America. Here the sacred and the
secular have mixed readily to bring forth biblical film
blockbusters featuring bad 1950s hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   And in that tradition, the publishing industry _ no stranger to
overstatement _ has for a long time been cranking out multitudes of
``bibles.'' Behold, an Easter assortment!

<P>
   FISHER ISLAND, Fla. _ When he sold Hebrew National, the family
cold-cuts business, for more than $100 million six years ago,
Isadore Pines did not imagine that he would spend his retirement
stirring up his neighbors on this idyllic redoubt a short ferry
ride south of Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Pines _ whose friends call him Skippy _ seems a most unlikely
rebel. He owns a $4.5 million apartment that overlooks the ocean,
and he has rickety legs that undermine his tennis game. But like
dozens of others here, he believes that plans by the developers who
recently bought much of Fisher Island to build 315 lavish
condominiums amid the royal palms and banyan trees can only
diminish the current residents' quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And so Pines has become a captain in a war between the haves and
the haves that has raged for two years across this 216-acre island,
which Oprah Winfrey, Mel Brooks, retired corporate moguls and
various South American jet-setters call home _ at least during the
high season.
</P>
<P>
   An incident last month illustrates just how tense, and sometimes
comic, the conflict has become.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pines, he was nearly mowed down at dusk on March 11
by a golf cart driven by one of the island's developers. Pines
acknowledges that he was distributing fliers despite a warning from
security guards, but he contends that the developer, Daniel McLean,
veered away to avoid hitting him only at the last possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although McLean said that the near sideswipe was unintentional
and that he simply did not see Pines ``in the dark,'' Pines called
the police, his lawyer and his publicist.
</P>
<P>
   And a passer-by, seeing Pines talking with a Miami police
officer, used a cell phone to alert fellow rebels at a nearby
cocktail party. Twenty men jumped into their own golf carts and
converged on the scene. No riot ensued, but the incident moved
quickly from the gossip pages of the local newspapers into the lore
of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute on Fisher Island, which has spawned at least a dozen
lawsuits, is not unlike those that touch off the kind of Florida
condominium wars caricatured in ``Seinfeld'' episodes _ or
Manhattan development battles like the current effort by
well-heeled East Side residents to stop Donald Trump from building
a residential tower near the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to think of a turf war involving as many captains
of industry, millionaire entrepreneurs and celebrities as the one
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fisher Island is a beautiful, glamorous development that's
captured a lot of people's attention,'' said Lewis Goodkin, a
longtime Miami real estate consultant. ``There's nothing more
difficult than a developer going into a community populated largely
by wealthy people, all of whom have influence that could work
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher Island, which advertisements depict as ``unrivaled in
luxury, seclusion and grace,'' sits in the aquamarine waters of
Biscayne Bay, accessible only by private ferries that make the
seven-minute run from Miami Beach every quarter-hour. Security
guards check each visitor, insuring privacy. A narrow tree- and
shrub-lined road circles the island. In the center is a nine-hole
golf course; strung along the perimeter are red-roofed
condominiums, an exquisite clubhouse, a marina, six restaurants and
17 tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, a major Chicago developer, and his partner John Melk, a
Chicago financier, bought their chunk of the island for about $50
million last July after a lengthy, fractious and unsuccessful
attempt by the residents to buy it themselves. The two men acquired
33 unsold apartments, boat slips, unsold memberships in the Fisher
Island Club and 40 acres of land, with the right to add 637 new
units of housing to the island's existing 563.
</P>
<P>
   Melk, a bearish, gray-haired man, bought his own
5,800-square-foot apartment on the island in 1990, for $2.3
million. He said he was surprised by the opposition to last year's
development deal, especially since he planned to reduce the total
number of club memberships and build only 315 new units, just half
the number for which he had permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be the white knight,'' said Melk, who together
with his friend H. Wayne Huizenga made a fortune from investments
in Waste Management Inc. and the Blockbuster video chain. ``We're
downsizing, so there should be cheers and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pines and others, including Murray Norkin, a retired
residential builder from New York, say that the new units, though
fewer than had been planned, would be larger, and that the total
amount of residential space on the island would jump by 70 percent.
That, they say, would overwhelm the island's services, causing long
lines at the restaurants and unconscionable delays at the ferry and
the golf club.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, fought largely among fewer than half the island's
residents _ those who spend more than several weeks a year here _
has grown mean-spirited. ``They're not held back by honesty or
ethics,'' Melk said of his opponents, who return the compliment in
their characterizations of him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday, there was ample parking available and
little competition for tables at the island's six restaurants,
although everyone agrees the island is more crowded on the weekends
and virtually empty during the summer. Aside from tennis pro Pete
Sampras, who was warming up on Court 6 for the Lipton Championships
on Key Biscayne, the tennis courts were empty. There was a traffic
jam at the ferry, though, when activists on both sides of the
dispute headed to Miami for a public hearing on the development
project.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels concede that they bought their property on the island
knowing that plans called for the total number of apartments here
to reach as many as 1,200, although they now find that
unacceptable. Pines favors banning more growth altogether, but many
other residents say they would accept an additional 100 or even 200
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melk is not selling _ and we did not buy _ traffic fumes and
overcrowding,'' said Gerri LeBow, who has opposed the developers'
efforts along with her husband, maverick financier Bennett LeBow,
best known for his Brooke Group's break with other tobacco
companies when it turned over documents in the states' historic
anti-smoking lawsuits. The LeBows live year-round on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought privacy, beauty, and most of all, safety, which will
disappear with 315 more condominiums,'' Mrs. LeBow said. ``The
island has one road only to serve residents, visitors and staff of
all kinds, not to mention hotel guests and their guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side contends that it represents the majority view, and
each says that property values will plummet if the other prevails.
</P>
<P>
   `` Melk stands to make more than $100 million,'' Pines said.
``He expects us to watch the value of our apartments go down, our
expenses go up and our beautiful island be paved over with
concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   Monette Klein-O'Grady, a longtime resident who had been involved
in residents' negotiations to buy the island, now supports Melk.
She said that Pines, whom she labels an ``extremist,'' and the
others opposing the developers are part of a cabal that has
intimidated residents in a ``radical'' attempt to take control of
the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not come to terms with not owning the island,'' said
Ms. Klein-O'Grady, a real estate consultant, as she and the
developers' publicist sat on her apartment veranda, just 15 yards
from the ocean. ``They're making life miserable for the majority of
people on the island. Today we have a respected developer who has a
passion for the island. I believe we as a group should move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The competing factions have showered residents with enough
leaflets, position papers and open letters to constitute the
island's first snowfall. Sadly, some one-time friends no longer
talk to one another. And some people are unable to find golf or
tennis partners.
</P>
<P>
   In what many residents viewed as a referendum on the development
issue, David Bianchi, a Miami lawyer backed by the rebels, recently
won election as a director of the Fisher Island Club, which
oversees the golf club, restaurants and recreational facilities. He
received about 60 percent of the vote, defeating Ira Kaufman, the
former chairman of the Exchange National Bank in Chicago, who
supports the developers. The rebels also gathered more than 200
signatures on a petition demanding a moratorium on development and
submitted it to the Miami-Dade County Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hearing on the petition in Miami, on March 18, that
caused the traffic jam on the way to the ferry. In the hearing
room, the bitterness of the division was apparent. Knots of
residents turned their backs on one another.
</P>
<P>
   One side contended that a physician living on the island had
strong-armed a patient into signing a petition; the other countered
that a resident had switched sides because the developer promised
him a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heartbreaking,'' said a visibly dismayed Sharon Gless,
who played Cagney in the television crime drama ``Cagney and
Lacey'' and is neutral in the development dispute. ``Friendships
have been severed, it seems like for life. All the affection people
had seems to be gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhetorical salvos continued during the six-hour hearing.
``This is a block war, a unit-by-unit war by some people who don't
want to wait 15 minutes for a ferryboat,'' testified Clifford
Shulman, a lawyer for the developers. ``They've had this little
island paradise to themselves, and they want to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member commission rejected the moratorium. Pines said he
had not expected to win, though he took solace in the commission's
decision to conduct a traffic study and to examine whether island
development had violated covenants with Miami. The rebels vowed to
keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that the residents, with 450 employees to
maintain the amenities they share, lead a pampered existence. But
many residents feel that they have paid for the pampering. The
average cost of their apartments was about $1.8 million, and it
costs an additional $80,000 to join the island club. The owner of a
large apartment can also expect to pay about $130,000 a year in
club dues, taxes and condominium and community fees.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, like Melk and residents on the other side of the
barricade, becomes almost poetic in describing life on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the crown jewel of real estate, surrounded by turquoise
water, a stone's throw from South Beach, 15 minutes from an
international airport,'' he said. ``You can get up early, walk past
the royal palms when no one's around and see the macaws flying in
the trees. You're in paradise.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Created in 1905 when the federal government sliced off the
southern tip of Miami Beach to make a shipping channel from Miami
to the Atlantic Ocean, Fisher Island has long been both a bauble
for the rich and a financial black hole for anyone who struggled to
develop its sandy, sun-drenched surface.
</P>
<P>
   The island got its name from Carl Fisher, the flamboyant
entrepreneur who converted an alligator-infested mangrove swamp
into Miami Beach. He bought the island in 1919 from Dana Dorsey, a
prominent black businessman in Miami who had given up on an effort
to build a resort for blacks who were barred from Miami's beaches.
Fisher spent nearly $5 million developing plans for a seaport and
squabbling with the City of Miami before he swapped the island in
1927 for a 250-foot yacht owned by William K. Vanderbilt II, the
railroad heir.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt built an estate on the island with marble fireplaces,
oak and mahogany paneling, servants' quarters, swimming pools and a
nine-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After he died in 1944, Fisher Island passed through the hands of
several other millionaires before a development group that included
Charles (Bebe) Rebozo and his friend Richard M. Nixon bought it in
1963. The group wanted to build 5,000 apartments and a 1,200-room
hotel but got bogged down in a zoning battle with the city, which
wanted the island for a public park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., based in Newark,
N.J., bought the island and formed a partnership with William
Rebozo, Charles' nephew, to develop a more modest 1,200
condominiums for the upper middle class. Expenses mounted while
nothing was built, and Mutual Benefit ousted Rebozo in 1985 and
redesigned the plans for a wealthier market. By 1993, two years
after Mutual Benefit had fallen into receivership, the insurance
company had poured $317 million into building apartments, a health
spa, tennis courts, restaurants and a new golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rave reviews for the development, 225 of 563
condominiums remained unsold. It would take another six years to
sell them.
</P>
<P>
   The current battle for Fisher Island began in 1997, when Mutual
Benefit announced that it would sell the development as a prelude
to the sale of the insurance company itself, which was completed
early this year. Various groups on the island formed a negotiating
team to buy the island for the residents, but just as a $10 million
deal was taking shape in December 1997, the unity of the residents
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klein-O'Grady, who had appointed some members of the
negotiating team, sent a letter to the chairman of the insurance
company, Alan Bowers, stating that his representatives were meeting
with ``a narrow group of residents'' and urging him to meet instead
with a ``responsible developer.'' Many of the activists on both
sides blame her for the failure of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Klein-O'Grady said she disagreed with the terms, fearing
that they would drive up the average resident's costs by $30,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits flew between the residents and the insurance company
and among residents themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual Benefit, which was suffering $6 million to $10 million a
year in operating losses, then turned to Boca Developers, a
residential developer in Florida. But Boca, too, failed to conclude
a deal, and it filed yet another lawsuit, this one contending that
14 island residents had scared off lenders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pines, who had not yet been involved in the
disputes, joined with others in another unsuccessful effort to buy
the island for the residents. The group included Richard Voell, the
former president of the Rockefeller Group, a private real estate,
entertainment and telecommunications company, and David Paresky,
who had sold his company, Thomas Cook Travel, to American Express
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Melk said, he and McLean received a call from a
real estate broker asking them to consider bidding for Fisher
Island. In a matter of weeks, the developers signed a deal with the
desperate insurance company. However, Melk, like the residents'
team and Boca Developers, had been bound by a confidentiality
agreement that prevented him from talking about the deal during
negotiations, a condition that bred distrust among residents.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any common ground with the developer, Ms.
LeBow gave an answer born of the boardroom. ``All of life is a
negotiation,'' she said, suggesting that there was room to talk
about the number of new apartments that the rebels could accept.
``It's time to sit around the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean, however, does not sound like someone ready to make
peace. ``They can harass us to death,'' he said, ``but there's no
way they can prevent us from building.''
</P>
<P>
   The developer may not have taken the full measure of Pines. He
spent decades, he said, worrying about someone finding a piece of
glass in one of his Hebrew National kosher hot dogs; after all, his
company described itself as answering ``to a higher authority.''
But after selling the company to Conagra in 1993, he looked forward
to a stress-free life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has become a man with a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so not my life style,'' Pines said, sounding a bit
sheepish as he explained the tactics of his protest, including his
new habit of parking his Lexus, with a rear-window sign emblazoned
``Stop the Destruction of Fisher Island,'' in front of the island's
sales office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loner,'' he said. ``But I've spoken to more people in
the last year than in my lifetime. I'm at a stage in life where I
don't want to be taken advantage of.''

THERE'S HUGE PAYROLL DISPARITY AMONG TEAMS, BUT SOME PLAYERS LIKE
IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball people have probably spent more time this winter
talking about the growing disparity in team payrolls than they have
about this year's top rookies or even Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, owners, general managers and other club executives
all lament the disparity and predict doom and gloom for those teams
_ more than half the clubs in the majors _ whose payrolls will be
under $50 million this year. The first ball has not been thrown out
for Sunday night's season-opening game in Monterrey, Mexico, and
already 16 of the 30 teams, if not more, they say, have no chance
to contend for the playoffs six months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Payroll disparity is No. 1 on management's list of problems.
Commissioner Bud Selig, in fact, has named a blue-ribbon panel to
try to find a solution to the problem that has the Yankees opening
the season with an $85 million payroll and the Montreal Expos
paying about one-fifth of that.
</P>
<P>
   Players are not represented on the panel; officials have not
asked them what they think. On a recent HBO ``Real Sports'' segment
dealing with the disparity, Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks had this
to say of the union's opposition to a salary cap: ``If 85 or 90
percent of their constituents are unhappy because they don't have a
chance to win on the day the season opens, the union's going to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere near that percentage of players, however, is unhappy
with their contending status. Some are, to be sure. But a growing
number has reason to like the disparity because it has created jobs
for them. That view became evident this spring during interviews
with dozens of players and managers on teams that are the have-nots
or the haves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have a team in that predicament, they're
going to have a lot of young guys who are glad to have a chance of
playing,'' said Kevin Brown, whose $105 million contract with the
Los Angeles Dodgers magnified the disparity. ``They're getting a
chance to get their foot in the door and start their big league
careers. It's hard to damn that situation. It's produced a lot of
good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, players even on low-paid teams refuse to begin a
season feeling beaten. ``If you're a major leaguer, you shouldn't
be coming into a clubhouse at the beginning of the season saying
you don't have a chance,'' Dustin Hermanson of Montreal said. ``If
you do, you shouldn't be in the major leagues. I believe in
Cinderella stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players do see the problem that management officials and
fans see. ``The disparity is definitely ridiculous,'' Ed Sprague,
Pittsburgh's veteran third baseman, said. ``The number of teams
with a legitimate shot every year is shrinking. Something needs to
be done. I think players are starting to realize that. I don't
think the playing field should be totally equal. But I think the
disparity needs to shrink a little bit. I don't think you can have
a team with a $90 million payroll and one with a $10 million
payroll. That's not a healthy industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The players who expressed Sprague's view, though, generally also
said they felt the owners were the ones who should devise a
solution. And while they were at it, they said the owners shouldn't
bother proposing any kind of a payroll cap. The last such
suggestion led to a labor dispute that nearly killed the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the winterlong anguish over disparity, though, no one had
considered the benefits some of the players and managers discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Maddux, a veteran relief pitcher with the Expos, who have
the major leagues' lowest payroll, has seen first-hand the point
Brown made. His teammates, Maddux said, don't feel deprived of a
chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a factor for anyone here,'' he said one
day in Jupiter, Fla. ``You have young guys trying to establish
themselves. They get their time in. In the past Montreal has been a
feeder for other clubs. A lot of guys see that here and use it as
an apprenticeship.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly and Tony Muser, managers of two economically
challenged teams, use the system as motivation for their young
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the players what an avenue that has opened up for
you,'' said Kelly, who has 10 rookies among his 25 Minnesota
players. ``It's a wonderful avenue to drive down. They're not
stupid. They see a chance here to play in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker, the Twins' second baseman, is good enough that he
would have won a job in the majors under any system, but he
acknowledged the break young players get with teams like the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as players consider it a blessing just to be in the big
leagues and have an opportunity to play,'' the third-year player
said. ``You'd like to make the playoffs and win some championship
games, but we don't count ourselves out based on economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Muser, the Kansas City manager, said he has told his players,
young and older, to take advantage of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys in here who have a chance to be major league
players who wouldn't have a chance somewhere else,'' he said. ``We
have guys like Rey Sanchez and Joe Randa who have a chance to be
everyday players that were said to be platoon-type players, and
maybe they are. But here they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff King has experienced downsizing in Pittsburgh and Kansas
City, making him an expert on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some young guys on this team who are going to turn
out to be very good players,'' King, the Royals' first baseman,
said. But he added a caveat that has been demonstrated vividly in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to be a matter of time before they won't be
able to keep those guys,'' he said. ``That's why nothing is going
to change. When I was just coming up, teams were holding on to
these guys until they were free agents. Now after three or four
years guys are making so much money that they probably won't be
able to hold onto them. That's something somebody's going to have
to think about and maybe try to fix.''

</P>
<P>
   Although opening-day payrolls won't be set until teams name
their 25-man rosters and players who open on the disabled list, it
is a given that half a dozen teams will have payrolls beyond or
just under $70 million. They and another six or eight with payrolls
exceeding $50 million are considered the only teams with a chance
for the playoffs. The other, lower-paid teams are fodder for the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the disparity in the payrolls is obviously
creating a bad situation for a lot of teams,'' Mike Mordecai of
Montreal said. ``Looking at it from the fans' standpoint, why would
they want to waste their money and go see a team that isn't going
to finish in the top four in the division?''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, players said that owners have to create a
more level playing field by sharing more of their revenue and
requiring that clubs that receive money under the revenue-sharing
plan use it for their payrolls. The Expos received $13 million
under baseball's partially implemented welfare plan last year but
had only an $8.3 million payroll. They acknowledge that they made
money.
</P>
<P>
   Players also said that if particular owners can't afford to
compete, they should sell their teams, and if particular cities
can't support teams, the teams should move. Tim Belcher, a veteran
starter now with Anaheim after having spent the past three seasons
in Kansas City, suggested that baseball created a problem by
overexpanding.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Players Association should do anything to deal with
the problem, Mordecai said, ``Listen to what the owners have to
offer at the next bargaining session.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Montgomery of Kansas City, who has been active in union
affairs, said the union should ``take the pulse of the players to
see how guys feel over all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of our association,'' the veteran
closer added, ``to decide what's best, not just for the players but
for baseball. Players are only going to prosper if baseball
prospers and that's what worries me about baseball. I don't know
how much longer it's going to go on like this before there's a
problem that's beyond repair.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone of the Yankees, the union's most articulate spokesman
among its members, acknowledged some frustration among players on
have-not teams. But he cautioned both sides to await further
results of the plans in place and the opening of the half-dozen
stadiums under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get all the data in and re-evaluate,'' Cone said.
``Everybody says we need a more level playing field. Everybody
seems to agree, but how do you get that? How much does the luxury
tax help? How much revenue-sharing is really needed? How much will
all these new stadiums help solve some of these problems? They
aren't the end-all answer to the problems, but you have to start
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he talk to players on other teams about the situation?
``Sure I do,'' Cone said. ``A lot of them want to get traded to
contenders.''  &QL;

RETURNS OF VALUE MANAGERS HAVE FADED IN GROWTH FUNDS' SHADOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   Think value investors have it tough these days? Just ask William
Nasgovitz, portfolio manager of the Heartland Value fund, whose own
mother recently tried to pull her money out of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom wanted to buy Walgreen at 50 times earnings and sell
out of the value fund after making six times her money,'' Nasgovitz
said. ``It's a great company, but it isn't worth 50 times
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   He eventually persuaded his mother to stay put. Recently,
however, his son Will admitted to buying an index fund. ``Another
little dagger,'' Nasgovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many more. ``Clients, consultants and advisers are
all tired of talking value,'' he said. ``They want action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' in this case really means one thing: big growth
companies and the funds that invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   Value managers like Nasgovitz have long shunned what they view
as overvalued growth stocks like Pfizer or Wal-Mart, trading at 40
times earnings or more. Instead, they favor stocks with lower
price-to-earnings or other valuation ratios.
</P>
<P>
   But that has lately brought grief for their shareholders, as
stocks relatively cheap by traditional measures continue to be
clobbered by the big growth companies that have paced the enormous
run-up in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Morningstar Inc., large-cap growth funds
beat large-cap value funds by an average of nearly 25 percentage
points over the last 12 months, the widest margin this generation.
The trend held in the first quarter of 1999, with large-cap growth
funds turning in an average return of 6.9 percent, versus 0.9
percent for comparable value funds. Mid-caps and small caps, which
have trailed the large caps over all, have shown similar
disjunction, with growth funds wildly outperforming their value
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nasgovitz's small-cap value fund, it lost 8.3 percent in
the last quarter, slightly less than the average for its peer
group.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate straits of value managers have begun to alter the
investing landscape. While investors in the funds are the most
obvious sufferers, entire fund organizations are being disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts are questioning the accepted wisdom that investors
should hew closely to a specific investment style. And the plight
of the value manager is not helped by the fact that no one seems
sure why value stocks have underperformed so much in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   After being stalwart in their loyalty, longtime value fund
shareholders have begun to bolt: So far in 1999, three-quarters of
the funds with the largest investor withdrawals have been value
funds, according to AMG Data Services, a company in Arcata, Calif.,
that tracks mutual fund sales. Investors have pulled $10.3 billion
from those 15 funds this year, with the biggest net withdrawal _
$1.2 billion _ coming from the once-storied Vanguard Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, so far this year, a total of $9.6 billion has poured
into the two most popular growth funds, the Janus 20 and the
Vanguard Growth Index, together with the Vanguard 500 Index.
</P>
<P>
   The role of value funds _ especially those of the large-cap
variety _ as a mainstay of the individual investor's portfolio has
been diminishing. Just over a year ago, investors had $2 invested
in large-cap value funds for every $1 in large growth funds,
according to Financial Research Corp., a data gatherer in Boston.
But that ratio has narrowed, to $2 in the value funds for every
$1.40 in the growth funds _ a result of market gains, sales of
value fund shares and purchases of growth fund shares.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend is accelerating. About 98 percent of new money
flowing into equity mutual funds this year has gone to growth
funds, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies with a value bent are feeling investors' pain.
Shares of Franklin Resources, a big value and international mutual
fund manager, dropped 47.1 percent in the last year as some of its
best-known funds, including the Mutual Series funds, lagged
substantially behind the market. (By comparison, shares of Kansas
City Southern Industries, which owns the red-hot Janus funds, have
jumped almost one-third over the last 12 months to near an all-time
high, as its assets have soared 60 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   But as Nasgovitz can attest, it is the value managers themselves
who have borne the brunt of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Poor performance recently led the Vanguard Group's chief
executive, John J. Brennan, to hire stock-pickers from Sanford C.
Bernstein to take over part of the Windsor fund portfolio run by
the value manager Charles Freeman, a longtime protege of the
legendary Windsor manager John Neff.
</P>
<P>
   And last month Jean-Marie Eveillard, the value manager at
Societe Generale, saw the demise of a deal to sell the company's
asset management unit to Liberty Financial after $2 billion in
losses and investor withdrawals from his company's mutual funds.
``It has been four years of basically crossing the desert,'' said
Eveillard, who owns 20 percent of the money management unit. ``If
one was not in big growth stocks, one was pretty much left with the
crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all the disruption, there is no consensus on what has caused
the gap between value and growth to be so wide, or on when it will
close.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers think that with the advent of a new,
technology-driven economy _ where economic cycles are far longer
than they have been in the past _ it could be many years before
value stocks return to favor for an appreciable period.
</P>
<P>
   But more managers cite a combination of temporary issues. Among
the big factors over the last two years, many say, were the
economic crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil that moved money
managers to buy the big technology and stable multinational
consumer-goods companies that proved, quarter after quarter, that
they could sustain profit growth even in rocky times.
</P>
<P>
   Growth stocks were driven up further, they say, by what is
sometimes called ``closet indexing'' _ the purchase of the
largest-capitalization stocks in, say, the S&AMP;P by active fund
managers. Some managers moved into these big growth stocks simply
because they grew tired of missing out on the market's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to Internet stocks also played a role in helping growth
funds, some said, while day traders _ the ultimate momentum players
_ became market movers in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Low interest rates, meanwhile, allowed bullish analysts and
investors to justify ever-increasing P/E multiples. Plummeting
commodity prices, driven lower by waning Asian demand, socked
energy and natural resources companies, core holdings of many value
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding commodity companies was the biggest reason that the $31
billion Vanguard Windsor II fund beat so many other value funds
last year, said the fund's manager, James Barrow. ``The metals and
heavy chemicals and things like that, those stocks were just
terrible last year,'' said Barrow, whose fund rose 16.4 percent in
1998 but still trailed the average large-cap growth fund by nearly
20 percentage points. Last quarter, it rose 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managers have been feeling increased pressure from fund
companies and 401(k) clients to stick with an investing style, be
it large-cap growth, small-cap value or whatever, no matter what
the market might do. Now, some value managers have rethought the
way they appraise the value-growth distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some have long been flexible. ``It boxes you in,''
said Charles Royce, who manages $2.3 billion in value-oriented
portfolios at Royce Funds, referring to the tendency to pigeonhole
managers into narrow classifications. ``It's defining what kind of
stocks you buy, as opposed to what you think is the most
interesting opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We buy growth stocks when they're depressed, but we're a value
manager,'' Royce added. ``If the style police were looking over our
shoulder, they would probably raise that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are less likely to do so: His funds have generally
lost less money in the last year than the average small-cap value
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow, the Vanguard manager, does not criticize value managers
who are riding high on some high-valuation stocks, like William
Miller of Legg Mason Value Trust, a large-cap fund that rose 49.9
percent in the last year on the back of high P/E stocks like Dell
Computer and America Online. ``I'd rather have his numbers, and try
to explain away his idea of value, than have mine,'' Barrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Few people, of course, predict the death of value equities,
which have outperformed growth stocks for long periods in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School
of the University of Pennsylvania, has noted that from 1962 to
1989, stocks with the lowest P/E ratios performed far better as a
group than stocks with the highest. And studies by Eugene Fama, a
University of Chicago finance professor, have shown that over long
periods, stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperform those
with higher ratios.
</P>
<P>
   But this does not mean that value investors will feel better
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence between growth and value could continue, said
George Sauter, manager of the $78 billion Vanguard 500 Index fund.
``Just because valuations would point more to value stocks and
small-cap stocks doesn't necessarily mean performance has to shift
there,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter predicted that value stocks would eventually make a
comeback but warned that investors should not base their decisions
on when that will happen. Stock-picking ``is child's play next to
trying to call value and growth cycles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Value fund investors may have to swallow one last bitter pill
anyway. While many investors think that the relatively low
price-earnings and price-book ratios of value stocks provide a
cushion during market corrections, that has not been true lately.
Large-cap value and growth stocks fell about the same amount during
the October 1997 selloff, while value stocks actually declined
slightly more than growth stocks during the correction last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Few value managers dare to predict when their turnaround might
come, but they say that higher inflation or a strengthening economy
would be strong catalysts. Some of them say, optimistically
perhaps, that the recent 37 percent jump in oil-service stocks
could be a harbinger. And others say growth stocks could
underperform value stocks if the Internet bubble popped or if
technology companies' growth abated after worries over the Year
2000 computer bug passed.
</P>
<P>
   A turn could come soon, Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist
at J.P. Morgan, has argued. His research indicates that the last
time stocks had such high valuations _ measured by comparing bond
yields with the average P/E ratio of the S&AMP;P 500 _ was about seven
years ago, when value stocks began a two-year period of sharp
outperformance over growth stocks. Moreover, he thinks value stocks
will be spurred by an upturn in global economic growth in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They were famous. They were feared. They were profiled in glossy
magazines. Now many managers of value funds are bleeding assets as
the funds, as a group, lag behind broad benchmarks like the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. How are some of these managers
coping?
</P>
<P>
   At the Short Hills, N.J., offices of Franklin Mutual Advisers,
the onetime proteges of renowned value investor Michael Price,
continue to focus on out-of-favor stocks. They favor the advice of
Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd in their 1934 value investor's
bible, ``Security Analysis'': Buy $1 worth of assets for 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That deep-value style was trumped last year by growth investing.
Relatively speaking, performance hasn't been bad: While the
flagship Mutual Shares fund lost 2.9 percent over the past 12
months, it beat the average mid-cap value fund by 6.2 percent, even
as its largest holding, the Sunbeam Corporation, fell 87.4 percent.
And the fund, with about $8 billion in assets, was up 4.9 percent
in the first quarter. The family's other big funds _ Mutual Beacon,
Mutual Qualified and Mutual Discovery _ reported similar returns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in January and February, investors pulled $2.5 billion
from the four funds, according to AMG Data Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``As surely as growth in certain periods will be the rage and
will attract the money and investment for that period, it will
ultimately end,'' said Larry Sondike, a co-manager of the Shares
and Beacon funds.
</P>
<P>
   Among his current holdings, J.C. Penney, which slid from $77
last June to $40.4375 on Thursday, reminds him of Sears, Roebuck, a
stock that the Mutual Series funds bought in the early 1990's and
that tripled in value as the retailer spun off Dean Witter and
Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   Penney's Eckerd drugstore unit and an insurance subsidiary are
worth $30 a share combined, Sondike said. The company has over $6
billion in debt, but it also has a department store and catalog
business with almost $4 a share in operating income last year.
</P>
<P>
   To Martin Whitman, the market has rarely carried so much danger
_ or opportunity. The manager made his name buying distressed
companies; lately, he has bet big on Japan and on United States
semiconductor equipment makers. In the first quarter, investors
pulled $161.5 million out of his $1.3 billion flagship, the Third
Avenue Value fund, which lost 8.2 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The recent market run-up is ``dangerous'' and ``scary,'' he
said, reminiscent of the narrow market dominated by the Nifty 50 in
the days before the 1973-74 selloff.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite stocks now is Tejon Ranch, a land
development and agribusiness concern. Its shares nearly tripled
after he bought a large stake in 1997 but have since fallen back to
$16.5625, a few dollars more than what he paid.
</P>
<P>
   William Nasgovitz, manager of Heartland Value, says he has seen
bad situations before. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
the fund dropped 30 percent in a few months _ twice as much as the
S&AMP;P. But over the next three years, the fund returned a cumulative
157 percent; the index rose 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is little solace now, as he watches investors withdraw
money from his fund _ including $245 million in the last three
months. ``The client pressure is just intense,'' he said. ``People
are caving in.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquirers have noticed the bargains. Ten companies in the fund's
portfolio of more than 300 stocks have been taken over this year.
``If that continues, we won't have any stocks left by
Thanksgiving,'' Nasgovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   One current holding is Gibson Greetings, the Cincinnati greeting
card company, which has drifted from almost $30 a share last year
to $7 and now trades for less than tangible book value. ``This
stock has had its own bear market,'' he said.

FROM THE START, THE PRIDE OF KALAMAZOO WAS BOUND FOR GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scout was a careful man, never given to hyperbole,
distinguished and respected, with a courtly manner that earned him
the nickname of the Prince in his days as a pitcher. He watched
17-year-old Derek Jeter play baseball in the summer of 1991 in
Kalamazoo, Mich., tracking him into the spring of 1992. He liked
Jeter's arm and lean frame and his speed, but the scout looked for
more.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth decade, the scout wrote out his reports, his
handwriting and his choice of words precise; there was no doubt how
this scout felt about any player, his supervisor would say years
later. You read his reports and the scout either liked a player or
he didn't. There was no hedging.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's skills were impressive and he radiated joy when he
played, the scout thought. Intrigued, he did what all good scouts
do: he started asking around, a private investigator with a
stopwatch and a radar gun. What kind of kid is Derek? Do his
teammates like him? Is his ego out of control? Is he a good
student? Does he want to go to college? What's his family like?
</P>
<P>
   The scout would learn a lot about Derek Jeter. Good things.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Jeter is set to begin his fourth year as the
Yankees' everyday shortstop. They open the 1999 season in Oakland
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ask around Kalamazoo, and everybody seems to have only good
things to say about Derek Jeter and his family. Derek was the type
of kid, Evelyn Lal said, ``that you wanted your kid to be friends
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanti Lal, her son, befriended Derek in the fourth grade, in
Mrs. Garzelloni's class at St. Augustine Cathedral School in
Kalamazoo. ``Derek was one of those kids you just never forget, and
I would say that even if he wasn't playing baseball,'' said Shirley
Garzelloni, who retired last year. ``He was the kind of student any
teacher would want to have. I was just struck with how much he
cared about his fellow classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared a little shy and quiet, she thought, but had a
composed confidence, even as a boy. He got along with everybody and
succeeded without needing to be prodded or praised. ``He was
completely self-motivated, creative, never wasted any time,''
Garzelloni recalled. ``There are kids who will say to you, `I don't
have anything to do' _ not with Derek. He always found something to
do. I remember doing a report card and thinking, `Does he realize
just how intelligent he is?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As smart as he was, Garzelloni said, Jeter never carried himself
as if he were any different from his classmates. Evelyn Lal said,
``He's quiet, but at the same time, he's very smart _ he knows how
to fit in, to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   He was comfortable around different types of people and, his
father suggested, that made sense. Charles Jeter is black and from
Alabama and Dorothy Jeter is white and from New Jersey, and Derek
seemed at ease with kids from all kinds of backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   There were the trials of youth: Charles Jeter remembered that
once when Derek was perhaps 10 or 11, a teacher told them that
Derek had said something cruel to a classmate. His parents
chastised Derek, told him this was unacceptable. You treat people
the way you want to be treated, they said, and Derek thought about
this quietly, absorbing and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty much head and shoulders above his
contemporaries, but he never came across as being arrogant,'' said
Chris Oosterban _ Jeter stills calls her ``Mrs. O'' _ who taught
writing and history to Jeter at St. Augustine when he was in the
seventh and eighth grade. ``He didn't paint a glowing picture of
himself, and he didn't have this `I'm really cool' attitude. He was
very genuine and humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter worked as a tutor in a computer laboratory in his last two
years of high school at Kalamazoo Central, and Sally Padley, who
taught Jeter in British literature, thought he conducted himself
perfectly. ``He just had an easy manner, no signs of conceit, and
when he was helping people, he didn't make any of them feel less
important,'' said Padley.
</P>
<P>
   She taught him in the last hour of school, a time when some
student-athletes departed to prepare for games. ``He absolutely
never asked for any special consideration,'' Padley recalled. ``He
never asked out of class, never bragged about his baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball was significant to him. His favorite team, Derek
told his fourth-grade teacher, was the New York Yankees, and he
wrote an essay in the eighth grade of his desire to play shortstop
for the Yankees. Padley asked her 11th-grade students to create a
coat of arms, unique to each of them and their personalities. In
one corner of Jeter's rendering, he included a picture of himself
wearing a Yankees uniform. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scout, careful and understated as he was, wrote an
assessment of Jeter: He's a special player and he's a special kid,
and this caught the attention of his supervisor, who had never read
words like this from the scout. Derek Jeter, the scout told his
supervisor, is going to be the anchor and the foundation of a
winning club.
</P>
<P>
   There was a meeting of all the team's scouts just before the
draft in 1992, and they discussed the available players. In these
meetings, they talk about skills, they analyze how good a prospect
is today and how his abilities will evolve over time. With high
school seniors _ like Jeter in 1992 _ they talk about whether the
prep star intends to play college baseball and how large a signing
bonus he wants. The names of prospective draftees are listed on
giant boards, the stock of some going up while others move down the
board.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted a college player with speed, there was Jeffrey
Hammonds, the outfielder from Stanford. Cal State-Fullerton's Phil
Nevin could become a great hitter, they agreed, the type of player
who might ascend quickly to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The distinguished scout from Michigan spoke of Jeter, of his
skills and his personality, and said it might require $1 million to
sign him _ a staggering bonus for that time. ``No one is worth $1
million,'' said the 74-year-old scout, who pitched for a few
thousand dollars a year in his day. ``But if one kid is worth that,
it's this kid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce their reports on Jeter, this scout and others
mentioned his parents: a great kid with great parents. Dorothy and
Charles Jeter were always involved, Derek's former teachers say,
always at the teacher-parent conferences, supportive of their
suggestions, interested in their input. Derek Jeter called his
11th-grade teacher ``Mrs. Padley,'' and so, too, did his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have extremely strong values,'' said Padley. ``They are
some of the best parents I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jeter was raised in a single-parent home, with a mother
who encouraged him and expected him to be accountable for the way
he treated others; Dorothy Jeter's parents supported her endeavors,
as well, and together, the Jeters believed in encouraging their two
children. When Derek said he wanted to be the shortstop for the
Yankees, they told him that with hard work, anything was possible,
and sometimes the four of them would go in their backyard to
practice _ Charles hitting ground balls, Derek fielding and
throwing the ball to his younger sister, Sharlee, perhaps Dorothy
pitching Wiffleball.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of each school year, Charles and Dorothy Jeter
sat down with a yellow legal pad and drew up a contract with Derek.
They agreed to terms on grades, on sports, on extracurricular
activities, on how to handle drugs, and the parents and their son
would sign together.
</P>
<P>
   Ace Adams, formerly the assistant baseball coach at the
University of Michigan, said the Jeters were the best parents of
any recruit he ever dealt with. Adams recalled how, after the
Yankees drafted Derek, the teen-ager informed him daily of the
progress of his contract negotiations, so that the Wolverines would
be prepared to replace Jeter if he signed.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent to Adams that Derek Jeter was going to be a
star, yet he and his parents never took Adams or the school for
granted. Dorothy Jeter once asked Adams, ``Are you sure Derek is
good enough to play here?'' Adams replied, ``Mrs. Jeter, he
could've started here when he was in the eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Padley, Oosterban and Garzelloni all spoke of their belief that
no matter how big a celebrity Jeter became, no matter how much
money he made, he would be rooted. ``Derek has a lot of things he's
going to learn about people, and being in the eye of the public,''
said Padley. ``But I believe he's going to remain a very decent
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter could never change _ never let the success go to his head
_ and get away with it, he said recently. ``I couldn't go home. I'm
no different than anybody else,'' Jeter said, except that he has a
pretty good job.
</P>
<P>
   He's still Derek from Kalamazoo, with the same friends from high
school, friends who are scattered around the country now. Doug
Biro, a friend from the fourth grade, stopped by the other day to
have dinner with him in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Shanti Lal, his friend from Mrs. Garzelloni's class, visited him
in the minor leagues in Columbus, Ohio, and in spring training two
years ago. They grew up together, laughed together; Derek and
Shanti and another friend had entered a talent contest, the three
of them, as the Jackson 5, with wigs and blue suits.
</P>
<P>
   Lal planned to go to medical school, but on May 4, 1997, his
sport utility vehicle rolled over on Interstate 94, and he was
thrown from it and killed. Dorothy Jeter was the first to arrive at
Evelyn Lal's house. Derek heard the news, and later, past midnight,
he called home and spoke to his father. ``I can't believe it,'' he
said. ``Shanti's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a baseball season, Jeter could not attend his
friend's service, but he wrote a letter, and his sister read the
words aloud, about his friendship with Shanti, how long they had
known each other, all their shared experiences, their last days in
Tampa together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek, he's a very good kid,'' Evelyn Lal said last week. ``He
is the type of kid I want my kids to be with, my Shanti.''
</P>
<P>
   The scout, who worked for the Houston Astros, got a phone call
from his supervisor, Dan O'Brien, just before the '92 draft.
O'Brien, then the scouting director for Houston, called to say the
Astros planned to select Nevin with the first overall pick. ``It's
an organizational decision,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The scout _ Hal Newhouser _ was ``extremely disappointed,''
O'Brien recalled. Newhouser implored club officials to reconsider
their decision. But the Astros drafted Nevin; Jeter fell into the
hands of the Yankees, who had the sixth pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouser began his baseball career in 1939 with the Detroit
Tigers, at age 18, won 207 games and two Most Valuable Player
awards and was inducted into the Hall of Fame, and in more than 50
years in the game, he had distinct tastes. He did not like Albert
Belle, he decided. ``I don't like his manners,'' he said once. ``I
don't like his attitude. As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't pay to
see him play.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked Derek Jeter, everything about him. After the Astros
picked Nevin instead of Jeter, Newhouser _ nearing retirement,
anyway _ quit baseball in disgust. He died at age 78 last fall, a
month after Jeter anchored the infield of history's most successful
team, the foundation of two championships in his first three years
in the majors. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON (Undated) _ Even before the 1999 major league
baseball season begins, it would seem that at least half of
baseball's teams are out of contention for no other reason than
budget constraints. A look at how they approach the game with that
in mind. By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON-ONETIMERS (Undated) _ The major league season starts
Sunday and, as is always the case, dozens of rookies will see
stardom looming before them. But for all their promise, at least a
few of them will become answers to a trivia question, appearing but
once. Then something _ injuries or fate or their own abilities _
will keep them from ever coming back. Countless ballplayers have
come up to the major leagues for the proverbial cup of coffee, but
only a few hundred have tasted the demitasse of a single game _
often at the end of blowouts or in the waning days of a losing
season. Most were standouts at every previous level of play. Some
bask in those memories. For others, their short careers still gnaw
at or embarrass them. By David Margolick.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-SEASON-GLOVES (Undated) _ Six million baseball gloves are
sold in the United States each year; maybe 2,000 end up on the
hands of major leaguers. For most of these players, there is no
piece of equipment more important than their glove, which makes
sense: bats break and balls disappear into the stands, but a
player's glove is always waiting for him back on the bench. Last
season home-run balls got all the attention; it seems appropriate
now to give equal time to gloves. By Noah Liberman.

PLAY BALL! A NEW SEASON FOR HEROES AND ONE-GAME WONDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID MARGOLICK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 50 years after the ball was hit, Joe Cleary can still
see the bad hop. Coming in for the Washington Senators in his first
major league game, with two runners on base and one out, Cleary got
the first Boston batter to hit what looked like a perfect
double-play ball. Instead, it skipped into the outfield. Then the
roof fell in.
</P>
<P>
   Eight more batters came to the plate that day in August 1945,
and Cleary got only one of them out: the pitcher. The Red Sox
scored 12 runs, leaving him with an earned run average of 189.00 _
still the highest calculable ERA in the history of baseball. When
he returned to the dugout, he and his manager nearly came to blows.
And ``the short, unhappy life of Joe Cleary in the big leagues,''
as Cleary himself now calls it, was over.
</P>
<P>
   The major league season starts Sunday and, as is always the
case, dozens of rookies will see stardom looming before them. But
for all their promise, at least a few of them will become answers
to a trivia question, appearing but once. Then something _ injuries
or fate or their own abilities _ will keep them from ever coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Countless ballplayers have come up to the major leagues for the
proverbial cup of coffee, but only a few hundred have tasted the
demitasse of a single game _ often at the end of blowouts or in the
waning days of a losing season. Most were standouts at every
previous level of play. In the more democratic ranks of the minor
leagues or spring training camps, all rubbed shoulders with
baseball's immortals: names like Satchel Paige, Duke Snider, Bobby
Thomson and Ted Williams fill their reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   Some bask in those memories. For others, their short careers
still gnaw at or embarrass them. Most have replayed their cameo
appearances a thousand times, and can recall the minutest details.
And they still hear from fans. When Earl Huckleberry died a few
weeks ago at the age of 88, 65 years after starting a game for
Connie Mack, he left behind a pile of autograph requests at the
Bowlegs, Okla., post office.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Shepard, a returning veteran who had lost the bottom of his
leg when shot down over Germany, came in to relieve Joe Cleary that
day in 1945. Though he pitched well _ giving up one run on three
hits over the rest of the game _ he, too, never played in the major
leagues again. Shepard suspects it was partly a matter of sympathy.
``Nobody wanted to see me go in and get clobbered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Van Dusen, an 18-year-old fresh from Bryant High School in
New York City, got his turn 10 years later, with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth against the Milwaukee Braves. His team, the
Philadelphia Phillies, was getting trounced and had run out of
pinch-hitters, even sending up a pitcher, Robin Roberts, before Van
Dusen. He finally got his chance _ and was hit by a pitch. He never
batted again. ``Well, they didn't get me out,'' said Van Dusen, an
insurance broker in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In the ranks of these one-game wonders can be found baseball's
rarest commodity: perfection. There are numerous hitters who batted
1.000 and pitchers who never allowed a base runner. More common are
pitchers with astronomical _ or even incalculable _ ERA's and
batters with a long string of goose eggs. And numerous oddities
fall somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Like Archibald (Moonlight) Graham, the New York Giants
outfielder immortalized in ``Field of Dreams,'' Frank Verdi of the
Yankees played an inning in the field but never got to bat; Casey
Stengel sent him up to pinch hit, only to change his mind when the
Red Sox changed pitchers. John Corriden of the 1946 Brooklyn
Dodgers pinch ran and scored, but also never got to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Harley Hisner of the Red Sox struck out Mickey
Mantle twice and gave up Joe DiMaggio's last regular-season hit. He
also batted 1 for 2, ending up with a career average higher than
either of them. ``That ought to be worth $2 million now,'' said
Hisner, a retired machinist in Monroeville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1981 season, John Lickert came in to catch for
the Red Sox in the seventh inning. But the closest he got to the
batter's box (apart from crouching behind home plate) was the
on-deck circle. So upset was Lickert's father that he confronted
the Red Sox manager, Ralph Houk, in the locker room. ``I'm probably
the only guy who has 17 zeroes in the record book,'' said Lickert,
who lives in Rhode Island and delivers cars for Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the fraternity of these footnoters, there are
legends. Playing for a team cobbled together when the real Detroit
Tigers went on strike in 1912, a seminarian named Aloysius Travers
pitched a complete game, and gave up 26 hits.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding four hits to the first five batters in his debut
in 1918, a Brooklyn rookie named Harry Heitman stalked off the
mound, enlisted in the Navy and never played again. Another famous
Dodger, Walter Alston, struck out in his only at-bat for the St.
Louis Cardinals (and made an error in the field). Then there was
Eddie Gaedel, the midget who walked in his only plate appearance,
for the St. Louis Browns, in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four players Mike Palagyi of the Washington Senators
faced in one game in 1939, three were future members of the Hall of
Fame: Ted Williams and Joe Cronin, both of whom he walked, and
Jimmy Foxx, whom he hit with a pitch. ``I threw but 2 strikes out
of 15 pitches _ a very short big league career,'' Palagyi told
Richard Tellis, author of ``Once Around the Bases'' (Triumph Books,
1998), which chronicles the stories of 40 players who lasted a
single game.
</P>
<P>
   There is John Paciorek, the only player ever to get three hits
in three at-bats. And while Robin is the Yount being inducted into
the Hall of Fame this year, his older brother, Larry, has his own
superlative: perhaps the shortest major league career ever. Yount
made the box score but never threw a pitch, opting while warming up
on the mound to save his sore arm for another day, a day that never
came. ``I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would be the
end of my career,'' Yount now says.
</P>
<P>
   In a game based more on money, in which every prospect is an
investment, expansion has made manpower more precious and
serendipity and whimsy have largely vanished, the frequency of
one-game wonders has dwindled. So too, then, has the likelihood
that certain elusive milestones will ever be achieved. While two
players (pitchers, at that) have tripled in their only plate
appearances, no one has ever homered. And perhaps no one ever will.

   Bobby Davidson pitched an inning for the Yankees in 1989, enough
time to give up a two-run homer to George Brett. ``Sometimes I
think about it, it almost feels like a dream,'' he said of his
brief big league career. Davidson, who became a chimney sweeper and
now works in computers in Cincinnati, has never been back to the
Bronx; he said he can't afford the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the lost child, the prodigal son, except I don't
feel there's a way to return,'' Davidson said. ``Every spring
there's a feeling that you're not where you're supposed to be. I
don't know if that will ever leave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Roe Skidmore had been riding the bench for the Chicago
Cubs for weeks when, in September 1970, Leo Durocher sent him up to
pinch hit. He hit the second pitch from Jerry Reuss over the head
of Joe Torre, then the Cardinals' third baseman, for a single.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was then retrieved _ the ball which still sits on his
mantelpiece, the one on which his wife wrote ``1st Big League
hit,'' not knowing she could have written ``last'' or ``only'' too.
Why? He thinks Durocher had it right about nice guys finishing
last. ``I didn't whine,'' said Skidmore, now a businessman in
Decatur, Ill. Every spring training, he said, a certain hollow
feeling grabs his gut. ``I'll go two or three weeks where I don't
even want to pick up the paper,'' he said. ``I just kind of ignore
the fact that it's starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore is one of at least 60 players to go 1 for 1. Only two
went 2 for 2, and only 18-year-old John Paciorek, brother of two
other major leaguers, went 3 for 3, singling three times and
walking twice for the ninth-place Houston Colt .45's against the
last-place Mets in the final game of the 1963 season. ``Every time
I came up the ball looked like a watermelon,'' said Paciorek, now a
physical education teacher and coach at a private school in
California. But a bad back did him in.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme was Joe Campbell of the 1967 Cubs, one of
only a few players to strike out all three times he batted. (True,
George Goetz fanned all four times he got up in 1889, but he was a
pitcher.) ``I was just too anxious, not that anyone's stuff was all
that great,'' said Campbell, who runs a Chevrolet dealership in
Lexington, Ky. ``I hit four or five balls out of the park foul. I
was getting good wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Bruckbauer, the first native Minnesotan to play for the
Minnesota Twins, seemed to spend more of his career at the Mayo
Clinic, nursing a bad arm, than on any team. He faced four batters
in 1961; three got hits on bloopers and scratch singles, he insists
_ and one walked. ``We'll get 'em next time,'' the Twins' manager,
Cookie Lavagetto, told him before giving him the hook. But there
was no next time, leaving Bruckbauer with an ignominious career ERA
of infinity.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dusen, who had hit a grand slam in a high school
championship game at Ebbets Field only a few weeks before his major
league debut, can still recall what Humberto Robinson threw him.
There was a strike down the middle (``That was the one I should
have swung at''), then a check swing, then a ball. Then came the
breaking pitch that nicked him on the knee. He didn't feel it. It
was his first game, he said, and he was already numb.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter Van Dusen was in the minors, where he partied
hard __ ``a million-dollar body with a nickel head'' is how he
described himself _ and quickly went ``from being a prospect to a
suspect.'' Soon he was through, and 20 years went by before he
could live with baseball again. ``Sometimes I go to sleep thinking
about hitting a hanging curve, even to this day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 80-year-old Cleary, the last major leaguer born in
Ireland, who watched Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium and regularly
sneaked into the Polo Grounds (``it was a sieve''), he has not been
to a game since 1954, though he lives in the Bronx. Then again, his
memories are more painful.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary had played years of semipro ball _ ``You've got a great
arm there, Kid, but you throw too many curveballs,'' Grover
Cleveland Alexander once told him _ and fought overseas before his
inning of infamy. Nothing fazed him. ``I always said, I get that
ball in my hand, I'm the boss, what can they do to hurt me?'' he
recalled. ``I never had butterflies. I could hardly wait to get on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   But then came the bad hop, some wildness, some bad breaks; the
payoff pitch to Dolph Camilli, Cleary insists, could just as easily
have been called a strike. Not deigning to come to the mound, the
Washington manager, Ossie Bluege, disgustedly waved for Cleary to
come in to the dugout. ``It was like he'd just found me in bed with
his wife,'' Cleary recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cleary waited for the manager to do the right thing: to
come and get him. ``Son, I think you better leave now,'' the umpire
eventually told him. But only when Bert Shepard reached the mound _
``Anyone can have a bad day, but imagine being replaced by a guy
with one leg!'' Cleary lamented _ did he walk toward the dugout.
``I took 30-mile hikes in the Army that weren't as long,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bluege greeted him with an obscenity which suggested that he was
never much of a pitcher to begin with. Cleary replied in kind, and
only his teammates prevented a fist fight. The next day he was
shipped to the minors, and he never came back.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican immigrants have brought a passion for baseball back to
Cleary's neighborhood. On the street, at the bar, in the liquor
store where he now picks up his mail _ it gets stolen when left in
his apartment building _ he is a minor celebrity, who still gets
ribbed about his baseball career and his bloated earned run
average. But he can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only answer I give them is, `Hey, I was there,' '' he
said. ``Only 14,000 guys have made it.''

METS LOOK TO PIAZZA, AN ENIGMATIC SUPERSTAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (jt)  
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Piazza prepares to enter his first full season as the
centerpiece of a rebuilt Mets offense and claim his place on the
most demanding of sports stages, he remains an enigmatic superstar.
</P>
<P>
   His detractors accuse him of self-interest, saying he is
concerned only with his bank account and his statistics. They say
he is not a great catcher and never will be. His supporters point
to the hard work and determination that allowed him to rise from
the oblivion of a 62nd-round draft choice into potentially the
best-hitting catcher ever.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza himself gives off conflicting signals, allowing multiple
impressions to flourish under the spotlight. His expression
alternates between a brooding scowl and an easy smile. Some days he
is aloof; others, friendly and approachable. Although his drive and
intensity are unquestioned, off the field he comes across as
California laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, even likely, that Piazza is all of the above.
But as the Mets prepare to open the season Monday night in Florida,
the question is whether the man who mixes urban fire and suburban
cool, the one who recently bought a house in affluent but anonymous
Bergen County, N.J., while still renting an Upper East Side
bachelor pad in Manhattan, will lead the franchise into the
post-season for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason you play this game,'' Piazza said
recently. ``But if I do my job and do it well, I have nothing to
worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contradictions, one thing is certain about the
30-year-old catcher: he has chosen a career path based on degree of
difficulty, like an Olympic dive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being constantly booed by impatient Mets fans waiting
for him to break out and despite appearing uncomfortable in his new
surroundings, Piazza chose to re-up for more hard labor in New
York. Without even testing the free-agent market, he signed a
seven-year, $91 million contract that briefly made him the
highest-paid player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   And he stated unequivocally that the goal of succeeding in New
York City was a major factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that I've never really turned away from a challenge
in my career,'' Piazza said. ``You can't ever be afraid to do
something. The Mets went a long way to acquire me. I just wanted to
give it a shot and fulfill their expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said he read a number of books in the off season dealing
with the differences between winning teams and losing teams. He
said he accepted the responsibility of having to provide
leadership, something his onetime Dodger teammate, Brett Butler,
once said Piazza was unable to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in leadership,'' Piazza said. ``And I definitely
believe I'm a leader. But I believe I lead by example. I've never
been anybody who reacts to somebody who is waving the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this cool facade, no matter what fire burns beneath it,
that distinguishes Piazza from the two main leaders of the Mets'
1986 world championship team: the gung-ho Gary Carter and the
steady, tutorial Keith Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Didier, a senior executive of the Arizona Diamondbacks and a
longtime Piazza family friend, said Piazza and Carter are ``just
the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary was the gung-ho kind,'' Didier said. ``This guy is quiet.
He leads by doing. He's not going to jump up and down. But he'll be
behind the plate every day and he will play hurt and nobody will
know about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think he's cocky or arrogant because of the
way that he walks. No, no, no. He's confident because of the way he
worked his tail off, because he was not a gifted player. He made
himself into a player. A lot of people don't know what Mike's been
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine, said, ``Mike takes his job
as personal as anybody I've ever been in uniform with.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's rise to the top of his profession has been recast into
baseball myth, an oft-told story of a tireless youth who never
succeeded until he switched to catcher and the Los Angeles Dodgers
drafted him as a favor to the family. Even today, Piazza's father,
Vince, cannot say who pushed harder, he or Mike, the second of his
five sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, it was him,'' Mike Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of both,'' said Vince Piazza, an
immigrant's son who dropped out of high school at 16 and parlayed a
small garage from which he sold used cars into a lucrative auto
dealership. ``But what I did with Michael then, if I did that now,
they'd probably get me for child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   From an early age, Mike Piazza spent countless hours hitting
from both sides of the plate. Indoors, he would hit balls into a
mattress propped up against the basement wall in their home in
Phoenixville, Pa. Outdoors, he hit into the makeshift batting cage
that Vince Piazza built from scratch and added lights to. As a boy,
Mike would shovel the snow out of it in the middle of winter when
he wanted to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it would rain, we'd go under the boardwalk and I'd throw
to him,'' Vince Piazza said, referring to some of the summers his
family spent on the Jersey Shore. ``In the apartment we rented, I'd
move the furniture out and he would hit Whiffle balls.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vince Piazza grew up in Norristown, Pa., with Tommy Lasorda, the
former Dodger manager, and Mike would serve as a batboy for the
Dodgers when Lasorda brought his team to Veterans Stadium in
Philadelphia. Mike played first base through high school, then
found little success, or playing time, at the University of Miami
and then Miami-Dade. When Piazza was passed over in the major
league draft after one nondescript season at the junior college,
his father suggested the switch to catcher as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the story is well documented. Lasorda intervened in 1988
to get Mike selected by the Dodgers with a courtesy pick.
</P>
<P>
   The former Dodgers pitcher Burt Hooton was one of Piazza's
rookie league coaches at Salem, Ore., in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story that if you sat down and wrote it as fiction, it
would be an unbelievable story,'' Hooton, who is now the pitching
coach at the University of Texas, said the other day. ``Because I
tell you, he was awful in Salem. And I won't be the only one to say
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a guy who fit the proverbial saying, `He can't
walk and chew gum at the same time,' it applied to him,'' Hooton
said. ``He didn't have a position he could play. And he pretty much
struck out most of the time. But every once in a while, if he did
hit it, it would go 450 or 500 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Struggling while playing for the Dodgers' Class A Vero Beach
team in 1990, Piazza nearly quit for good. ``I had a bad
attitude,'' Piazza said. ``If I wasn't playing, I felt like I was
wasting my time.'' But after Lasorda, Didier and general manager
Fred Claire intervened, Piazza returned.
</P>
<P>
   Mike could have easily quit and joined the family business,
Vince Piazza said, ``and he just didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, behind Piazza's back, some of his minor league teammates
resented the player they derisively called ``Tommy's boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza persevered. He spent a winter at the Dodgers' academy in
the Dominican Republic rooming in a dormitory as the only
English-speaking player just so he could catch more games. ``He
paid for his own fare,'' said Joe Ferguson, the former Dodger
catcher who was Piazza's manager there. ``He was kind of criticized
for that, because he never asked for permission. If anything, he
should have been applauded.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza spent another winter in Mexico, and another at the
Arizona Fall League. Gradually, he transformed himself into a
serviceable catcher and one of the finest right-handed hitters in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has been an All-Star each of his six seasons in the
league, and his .333 career batting average is second among active
players (behind Tony Gwynn at .339) with a minimum of 1,000 at
bats. If Piazza can just catch his usual 150 or so games a season
and approach his usual offensive numbers _ he's averaged 33 homers
and 106 runs batted in his six full seasons _ he will, in the Mets'
view, be worth every cent of the highest salary they have ever
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody in the ball park,'' said the Mets' co-owner,
Nelson Doubleday, explaining why he instructed general manager
Steve Phillips to pursue a trade for Piazza. ``And as soon as Mr.
Piazza showed up, things picked up. You've got to put a nickel in
to get a nickel out. We did need to sign him, absolutely. And we
built the team around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said: ``Mike doesn't have to be anything more than what
he's always been. He doesn't have to be a vocal leader. He just has
to go out and play like he's played _ and do it for the next seven
years.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL'S INHERENT TROPISM TOWARD TACKINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody was wondering just how baseball might respond to its
epic 1998 season. Now we know. The weasels are thinking of renting
out the uniforms to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   What a grand idea. The glorious Redbirds that have festooned the
St. Louis uniforms for much of this century will compete for space
with pizza parlors. The dignified stripes (not pinstripes, by the
way) that grace the Yankee uniform will be cheapened by
advertisements for video games. Or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   They need the money, baseball executives said last week. Those
dreadful players have held them up so much that they must recoup
their losses any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we wanted to see if Mark McGwire could match his 70
home runs _ or maybe grow a second head, if the andro goes bonkers
_ we have to brood over Major League Baseball's lack of
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   They are willing to turn their players into walking billboards
next year. They say it would be done tastefully. Of course it
would. As tasteful as stadiums being named for corporations that
will probably be swallowed up or out of existence in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising blitz on uniforms would be as tasteful as the
shameless pressure on cities to build luxury boxes for people who
actually hate baseball but love to ingest shrimp and wine in trendy
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I was working it over in my mind which team to cast a
hex upon this year _ I was waffling among the Padres, Orioles, Red
Sox and Yankees, for reasons I shall explain later _ now we have to
confront baseball's own crass penchant for uglification. (There is
no such word in my Spell Check, but there will be when people get a
load of advertisements on uniforms.)
</P>
<P>
   Baseball outfits went through their gaudy period during the
disco '70s, when the White Sox looked like softball players and the
Athletics looked like ``Saturday Night Fever'' personified.
</P>
<P>
   But just when uniforms were edging back toward traditionalism,
along comes the grubby marketing gang, hellbent on making Cal
Ripken Jr. look like Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   One argument I have heard is that European soccer teams have
made a practice of selling space to the highest bidder. And this is
true. World-renowned athletes run around with the logos of pasta
makers and electronics companies obliterating the team name.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but I had never previously heard American sports
officials citing soccer as their role model. If they really want to
emulate something about soccer, they could try the predictably
short games _ under two hours, and you're on your way home, with no
time to develop shrimp-and-wine ennui.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball geniuses could also emulate the spontaneous
creativity of soccer, which has no overt coaching and no timeouts,
at least not until Rupert dumbs it down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, baseball is looking to put a sandwich board on Sammy
Sosa's shoulders. But discreetly, of course. As discreet as the
shrewd performance by the San Diego Padres' management in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   When last we saw the Padres, they were getting thumped by the
Yankees, four straight, in the World Series, which was no disgrace.
This is the way baseball is going to be in the next century, with
big-market teams beating moderate-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   The way it stands now, teams like the Yankees bring in five
times as much income as teams like the Montreal Expos. Baseball has
paid lip service to equity by initiating a luxury tax, but the
concept of sharing television revenue, the way the NFL does, is
beyond these jokers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig, who has
operated a team in decidedly low-scale Milwaukee, ought to be an
advocate for revenue sharing. I'm sure we'll hear from him as soon
as he gets settled in his new job.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the San Diego officials had a plan for competing.
They had already tossed out the old name for the stadium _ Jack
Murphy, a beloved sports columnist _ to accept money from some
corporation with a geeky name. Now they decided they needed a whole
new stadium. Welcome to the club.
</P>
<P>
   Every franchise needs a new stadium. If only the citizens would
vote them a new stadium downtown, the argument went, the Padres
could make tons of money and spend it on a team that could keep up
with the Steinbrenners and the Murdochs.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on the euphoria of a pennant run, San Diego voters
went for the full monty, two weeks after the World Series. No
sooner were the votes verified than the team was gutted. The Padres
could not afford to keep Kevin Brown, after all. Greg Vaughn was
traded to Cincinnati. Ken Caminiti went back to Houston. Joey
Hamilton and Steve Finley departed.
</P>
<P>
   The owners did retain their ace relief pitcher, Trevor Hoffman,
but there ain't much to relieve. Nevertheless, the other day the
city approved the new ball park, which will house a team now fully
committed to mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' sins are not nearly as grievous as those of Wayne
Huizenga, who demolished the Florida Marlins weeks after they won
the 1997 World Series, and then sold the franchise for big bucks.
It was a distinct pleasure to root the Marlins into the cellar last
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are other candidates for negative rooting this year, three
in the same division _ the Red Sox for driving Mo Vaughn away, the
Orioles for importing the troubled Albert Belle, and the Yankees
for messing with Mother Nature by trading away their perfect biker,
David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer flimflammery, the Padres deserve a patch on their
uniform with No. 30 on it _ dead last. They can put that patch next
to the advertisement for the moving van. That threat usually comes
next.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KOSOVO &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ Responding to the staggering
refugee crisis caused by Serb attacks against ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo, NATO said Saturday it was planning to send a
force of six to eight thousand troops to Albania to provide
security and emergency relief for the masses of people Serb forces
are driving from their homeland. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Washington) _ The NATO allies have no plans to try
to stop the brutalities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo except
through an extended air campaign, which could continue for a ``few
months,'' according to senior Clinton administration officials. By
Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The two Interior
Ministry buildings hit by NATO cruise missiles overnight smoldered
on Saturday in Belgrade's morning haze, collapsed in on themselves
at wacky angles. They provided angry citizens evidence both of
NATO's astounding accuracy _ Yugoslav authorities said there were
no casualties of any kind _ and of the alliance's vow to strike
military and security headquarters, even in the heart of Serbia's
capital. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ President Clinton may
seem tired and worn these days, but President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia is looking on top of his little world. Milosevic is
riding above the fray, while his army and his police are capturing
(or abducting) American soldiers, shooting down a stealth airplane
and expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in numbers beyond any
Washington policy maker's most embarrassing nightmares. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Kukes, Albania) _ If NATO's air raid strategy
was meant to prevent Serbian forces from committing atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, as President Clinton and other
officials have said, it is an utter failure. The stark evidence of
that failure is in the haunted eyes of more than a quarter-million
refugees who have already been driven out of Kosovo in Slobodan
Milosevic's systematic, brutally efficient Serbian campaign to
depopulate the province of its majority Albanian population. A news
analysis. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HISTORY (Undated) _ The conflict between Serbs and
Albanians, currently embodied by the desperate Albanian families
fleeing Serbian pursuers in Kosovo, has a very long history that is
deeply felt, if selectively recalled, by those condemned to live
it. At the same time it has never been much understood or
appreciated beyond the southern Balkans. By Michael T. Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-LEGAL (Washington) _ From the briefing room at the State
Department to the corridors of Whitehall in London and NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, a word usually avoided by
policymakers is being uttered ever more frequently to describe
events in Kosovo: genocide. By invoking the word, policymakers in
the United States and Europe are helping provide a legal
justification for their military campaign against Serbia. By Neil
A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA (Washington) _ With the NATO bombing campaign in
Yugoslavia so far unable to deter the atrocities in Kosovo, and the
United States unwilling to commit ground troops, the idea of arming
the Kosovo guerrillas has garnered support from a number of
politicians and former policymakers. By Raymond Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBELS (Skopje, Macedonia) _ A top commander of the
Kosovo Liberation Army made an impassioned plea Saturday for NATO
countries to supply weapons and ammunition to his guerrilla force,
which he said was hampered in its losing battle to defend Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians from Serbian forces. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Since the Cold War ended, no other
event has so divided the West and Russia as the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia. The chasm is so deep that even words have taken on
opposite meaning. While Americans and Europeans talk about the
`'genocide'' of Kosovo Albanians by Serbs, many Russians talk about
the ``genocide'' of Serbs by American bombs. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-McCAIN (Washington) _ Sen. John McCain spent more than
five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and learned, he says,
the dangers of limited measures. He is now a forceful advocate of
all-out intervention in the Balkans. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton urged Americans
to donate money to provide food, water, medicine, blankets,
clothing and shelter for hundreds of thousands of refugees driven
from Kosovo. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-CRIME (Havana) _ Today Cuba, which for decades was immune
to the high crime rates of more open societies, is itself grappling
with a rising tide of common crime that has swelled in the last
year. By Mireya Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S. (Beijing) _ China's charismatic prime minister and
the driving force behind its ambitious economic changes arrives in
the United States next week determined to fight the downward spiral
in Chinese-American relations _ but without departing from the
Communist Party line. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-VATICAN (United Nations) _ In a novel twist to the fight
over legal abortion, an organization of Roman Catholic activists
has begun a drive to demote the diplomatic status of the Vatican at
the United Nations, though in reality it only hopes to curb its
lobbying style. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-NUNAVUT-PREMIER (Iqaluit, Nunavut) _ A few days after
becoming the north's first Inuit lawyer, Paul Okalik was selected
the first premier of the new territory of Nunavut, which came into
being Thursday in Canada's vast eastern Arctic. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-EMIGRANTS (New Delhi, India) _ The Indian government this
week initiated a program that will make it easier for people of
Indian descent sprinkled around the globe to travel to their
familial homeland and to invest in it, but stopped short of giving
them the right to vote, as many of them have sought. By Celia W.
Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GREEN-PARTY (Piedmont, Calif.) _ When fellow Green Party
members persuaded Audie Bock to run for the state Assembly last
December, they told her she had a choice. She could run a symbolic
campaign by putting her name on the ballot _ or she could campaign
seriously. Ms. Bock chose to run a real race, and she won _ making
her the first member of the Green Party to serve in a state
legislature anywhere in the nation, and the first third-party
candidate to serve in the California Assembly since 1914. By Bill
Staggs.
</P>
<P>
   RAPE-SPEAKOUT (Los Angeles) _ Several women who have lived
through rape are speaking out about it in Los Angeles, both in a
public service announcement broadcast on television and at a
conference on April 17 intended to help other victims. In speaking
out, the women are further lifting what has traditionally been a
protective curtain of anonymity to unveil the faces _ mother,
fiancee, the elderly _ of what they call a ``secret sorority.'' By
Christian Berthelsen.
</P>
<P>
   LUXURY-LINER (Philadelphia) _ An enormous luxury liner lies
empty and dark at the municipal pier here. The task facing its
owner and an avid band of preservationists is not focused on ocean
voyages but simply on gaining a secure future for a behemoth that
stands seven stories high, weighs 59,000 tons and stretches nearly
1,000 feet _ or ``110 feet longer than Titanic and she's still
floating,'' as one slogans says. By Iver Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ABSTINENCE-EDUC (Undated) _ For all the uproar when Congress set
aside $50 million a year for states to create abstinence-education
programs teaching the benefits of delaying sex until marriage,
every state in the nation ultimately applied for the money when it
became available in fiscal 1998. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES-FINANCE (Palm Beach, Fla.) _ Both Bill Bradley and
John McCain, presidential candidates who are known for championing
campaign finance reform, say that the existing laws leave them no
choice but to devote much time to traveling the country hunting for
millions of dollars or hitting up prospects during interminable
telephone calls. Neither is willing to follow the lead of Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who almost lost his re-election last year
because of several restrictions he imposed on his own fund raising.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORY-INDUSTRY (Undated) _ The graying of America has created
an emerging industry: a wave of herbal and dietary supplements,
books, courses and even clinics aimed at healthy people who are
having trouble remembering and concentrating. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   WYO-MURDER-AFTERMATH (Laramie, Wyo.) _ In the six months since
the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard, a gay 21-year-old college
student, the spot has become a pilgrimage site, as people bearing
poems and floral bouquets have worn deep ruts in a dirt track to
the lonely section of fence. By James Brooke.

 SPORTS COLUMN: McGWIRE, SOSA, AND THE UNCERTAIN STRIKE ZONE  
(jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hitting home runs is not like singing an encore at a concert. To
answer the applause, Bruce Springsteen or Whitney Houston can
always turn to the band and do one more, but this season it won't
be that easy for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to do what they did
last year, much less improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened last year might never happen again,''
McGwire was saying early last week. ``For people to expect it to
happen is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But judging by ticket sales in St. Louis and Chicago, some
people expect McGwire and Sosa to hit 70 and 66 homers again, or at
least hope they will.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had anybody buying season tickets in Busch Memorial
Stadium requested seats in the upper deck in left field. But when
the Cardinals open the season there Monday night against the
Milwaukee Brewers, about 200 season-ticket holders (at $16 a game,
that's $1,296 a ticket) will be up there pleading for Big Mac to
unload his first homer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall season ticket total is approaching our record of
21,000 in 1990,'' said Jose Arnold, the Cardinals' ticket director.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Cubs return to Wrigley Field April 12 for their
home opener against the Cincinnati Reds, about 150 of what are
quaintly known as Bleacher Bums will be season-ticket holders (at
$15 a game, that's $1,215 a ticket) out there waiting for one of
Sosa's shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do sell a limited number of bleacher season tickets,'' said
Frank Maloney, the Cubs' ticket director, ``but that's double the
number we sold a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And those ticket sales are realistic. But for McGwire and Sosa
to match their numbers of last season is, as the Cardinals slugger
warned, indeed unrealistic. Even so, through Friday's games in
spring training, Sosa led all hitters with 11 home runs and McGwire
was tied for second with 9. And if they resume their friendly duel,
each could hit at least 50 again.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa hit his 66th homer in the final week of last season,
remember, the Cubs' right fielder was one ahead of McGwire, but the
Cardinals' first baseman responded, as he had all season, with five
homers in his last three games. Each inspired the other.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows if Sosa's 66 was an aberration; he hit only 36
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 sluggers who hit at least 50 homers in a season, only
two _ McGwire and Ruth _ ever increased their production in a
following season. And McGwire is the only one to increase his
production the next two years. He jumped from 52 in 1996 to 58 in
1997 to his record 70 last year; he is also the only slugger to hit
at least 50 in three straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth went from 54 in 1920 (his first year with the Yankees) to
59 the next year. But he skidded three times after 50-homer
seasons, dropping from 59 in 1921 to 35, and from his then-record
60 in 1927 to 54, then to 46.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. has hit 56 in each of the last two seasons, the
only slugger with at least 50 who did not go up or down. Sosa and
Greg Vaughn, now with the Reds after hitting 50 for the Padres last
season, must cope for the first time with the season after joining
the ``50 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   All the other members of the 50 Club skidded the next season,
notably Roger Maris, who went from 61 in 1961 to 33, and Hack
Wilson, who went from what was then a National League record of 56
in 1930 to only 13.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, the career leader with 755 homers, never hit 50 in
a season. His high was 47 in 1971 with the Atlanta Braves; he hit
34 the next year. After his other 40-plus years, he dropped from 44
in 1957 to 30 and from 45 in 1962 to 44 and then 24 in Milwaukee,
and from 44 in 1966 to 39, from 44 in 1969 to 38 and from 40 in
1973 (at age 39) to 20 in Atlanta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A foggy factor for McGwire, Sosa and all hitters this season is
the uncertainty of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   When a Feb. 15 memo from Commissioner Bud Selig's office ordered
the umpires to call a higher strike (2 inches above the belt) as
well as tighten the strike zone on the outside of home plate, the
umpires filed a grievance; they argued that the rules had been
changed without their input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel all the umpires are following the directive in
spring training,'' said Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's new
executive vice president for baseball operations. ``But we intend
to be diligent in monitoring how the strike zone is called.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, the former Oakland general manager, remembered hearing
``players being more concerned about the next day's plate umpire
than the next day's starting pitcher; something's wrong there.''
And during last year's post-season, many pitches apparently wide of
the plate were called strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get the ball back over the plate,'' Alderson said,
``we'll see more strikes, more swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more home runs, too. Mark McGwire walked 162 times last
season, Sammy Sosa 73. But if hitters have to wonder what each
umpire's strike zone is, it will create more confusion than
confidence. Not only for sluggers, but for all those new
season-ticket holders out where the home runs land in St. Louis and
Chicago.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ NATO is waging war by
committee. The 19-member alliance operates by consensus, and its

Albania. By Michael R. Gordon

DRIVEN OVER, DOUSED AND MICROWAVED, LEATHER ENDURES AS THE PLAYERS'
CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NOAH LIBERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six million baseball gloves are sold in the United States each
year; maybe 2,000 end up on the hands of major leaguers. For most
of these players, there is no piece of equipment more important
than their glove, which makes sense: bats break and balls disappear
into the stands, but a player's glove is always waiting for him on
the bench. Last season, home run balls got all the attention; it
seems appropriate now to give equal time to gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Leather
</P>
<P>
   At the slaughterhouse, the 50- to 60-pound cowhides are sliced
in two lengthwise, cured in salt brine (so they do not spoil) and
stripped of flesh. They are shipped to tanneries, such as Horween
Leather in Chicago, which has prepared leather for decades to
Rawlings _ maker of about half of the gloves used in the major
leagues _ and now supplies Mizuno and Louisville Slugger. There,
hair, fats and oils are removed, the hides go through chemical and
water washes, a sulfuric acid pickling and a chromium-sulfate
tanning.
</P>
<P>
   Only then can Horween sort out the spotless 5 percent of hides
worthy of becoming a major leaguer's glove. ``If the animals had an
evil thought, it shows up,'' said Arnold Horween Jr., the
third-generation company president.
</P>
<P>
   Now considered leather, the hide is ``split'' to a thickness of
2 to 2.4 millimeters (less than 1 inch), treated with a fish oil,
buffed with sandpaper and stained to the glove maker's
specifications. From slaughter to leather, the process takes
roughly six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No material beats leather in a baseball glove. Meshes are too
fragile and prone to stretching, and shiny synthetic leathers look
cheap. The game-day glove of Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek,
the Wilson G4, does feature a pebble-grain synthetic back that is
billed as twice as strong and half as heavy as leather. The glove
designer Shigeaki Aso discovered the material on Wilson's
basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   Construction
</P>
<P>
   It takes another 10 days to construct a glove, though the
Rawlings designer Bob Clevenhagen says the process can be squeezed
into an hour if a prominent player is in a pinch. ``I just sent
Tony Gwynn a new one, UPS red label,'' Clevenhagen said, referring
to the San Diego outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   The palm is cut from the dense hide that ran along the cow's
backbone. The back of the glove comes from the flank; the lining
comes from the softer, stretched belly, and the web gets scraps
from anywhere. In all, it takes 16 to 20 pieces of leather (all
stamped out cookie-cutter style) and 8 to 12 feet of lacing.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces are sewn together inside-out and then inverted; fingers
are slid over an aluminum ``hot hand'' that smooths and shapes the
leather to accept the synthetic wool padding. Lace holes are
punched, eyelets added, straps and logos (ever larger) sewn on and,
finally, the glove is laced by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Web
</P>
<P>
   Imitation (and a 17-year limit on glove patents) means there are
only a few basic web styles, shared by all the makers.
</P>
<P>
   Solid webs, such as Wilson's Dual Hinge, are preferred by
pitchers, who want to hide their throwing hand as they adjust their
grip.
</P>
<P>
   Many middle infielders choose open webs, such as the single-post
crisscross on the Rawlings of Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez or
the half-solid H-web on the Mizuno of Atlanta third baseman Chipper
Jones, to give themselves ``quicker hands.'' They are an ounce or
so lighter than solid webs, which equals a pound to an infielder's
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   First basemen, outfielders and some third basemen prefer
multiple-crisscross webs. These players can afford a longer web,
and this pattern is a compromise between sturdiness and light
weight. The longtime Chicago Cubs third baseman Ron Santo may have
pioneered this style for Wilson, when he told the company he
sometimes could not feel line drives hit the solid web of his A2000
model.
</P>
<P>
   Some players at every position swear by the Basket Web, a woven
solid pattern that was under patent to Rawlings until 1983. ``I
just felt I could really get in there and find the ball,'' says
Ryne Sandberg, the former Cubs' second baseman, who abandoned the
single-post web when he switched from third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six fingers are better than five,'' Ozzie Smith says of the
Rawlings Trap-Eze model he used as a teen-ager and as an All-Star
shortstop for the Padres and Cardinals after the company
reintroduced it in 1978. With a long, laced-in finger for a web,
the Trap-Eze probably suited Smith's preference for a harder
surface he could use to ricochet the ball into his throwing hand,
as many shortstops do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a good-feeling glove with a nice look and nice
lines, like a nice car,'' Smith said. This gets to the heart of the
matter: often, players simply like something about the way a glove
looks. Then other players imitate them and manufacturers imitate
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Heel and Thumb
</P>
<P>
   Glove designers will suggest that the heel may have changed the
most over the last 30 years, getting progressively thinner. Joe
Morgan, the Hall of Fame second baseman, recognized that heel
padding was somewhat superfluous and removed layer after layer of
it until a glove suited him. Recently manufacturers have responded
to requests for thinner thumbs, as well, by using thinner plastic
thumb stays _ 1.5 millimeters compared with 2 before.
</P>
<P>
   Back
</P>
<P>
   Here's where a glove's architecture is revealed. Outfielders
(and roughly two-thirds of the retail market) prefer a closed-back
glove. These tend to have longer ``finger stalls,'' the leather
that divides the fingers, which allows outfielders to wear the
glove out on their fingertips like a ``claw.'' The traditional
open-back glove is preferred by infielders; it is lighter and has
shorter finger stalls, which allow the fingers farther into the
glove for more glove-to-palm contact.
</P>
<P>
   Most players slip their index finger outside the glove for
comfort. Joe Morgan went a step further, pressing it toward the
glove to flatten the pocket on grounders and pulling it back to
protect his palm on line drives. The Atlanta Braves ace Greg Maddux
learned he was tipping pitches by the way his index finger
protruded from his Wilson glove, so the company developed the Pro
Sleeve, a leather sheath sewn to the glove's back.
</P>
<P>
   The back also reveals an essential but often overlooked
component: the welts. These are the thin slices of leather sewn
into the seams between and on the backs of the fingers. Their grain
runs 90 degrees to the other leather, to provide needed stiffness
and shape-retention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Color
</P>
<P>
   Remember red gloves? They went out with Mitch Williams. In the
pro ranks, outfielders tend to prefer black gloves and infielders
brown ones, but it is the exceptions that are the most interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire wears a black glove at first base for the
Cardinals, but a few years ago, in a pinch, Rawlings replaced a
worn palm section and one bar of the web with tan. Now all of
McGwire's gloves are made that way. Two-tone gloves are popular in
the middle-infield positions, too; some trace this to the
well-traveled former second baseman Manny Trillo, who used to
darken the back of his glove with shoe polish when he came up with
the Oakland Athletics in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers outfielder Raul Mondesi may have the most colorful
current mitt, a scarlet and navy Rawlings number, and Tony Gwynn's
black Rawlings now sports two tan lightning bolts on the back of
each finger. Unlike McGwire's glove, Gwynn's will soon be available
at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Size and Shape
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Commissioner Fay Vincent ordered umpires to enforce the
rule that gloves could not be longer than 12 inches, measured from
the heel to the tip of the index finger. Manufacturers make no
secret of the fact that the longest glove made today is 13 inches,
and it is used by almost every outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Second basemen's gloves are the smallest, at 11 or 11\ inches,
the culmination of a shrinking process Nellie Fox began, Bill
Mazeroski continued and Joe Morgan completed. Nevertheless, White
Sox Manager Jerry Manuel, himself a second baseman, told his young
second baseman Ray Durham that his glove was too small last season;
Durham switched and his fielding improved.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstops' gloves run 11\ to 11{ inches, and third basemen's
may reach 12 inches. Third basemen tend to break in their gloves a
little longer and narrower, preferring the length for confidence
when diving for line shots. Middle infielders want the fingers
short and spread wide, to create a broad, shallow pocket. ``I tell
young shortstops to make the glove look like their open hand,''
Ozzie Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the younger catchers prefer smaller mitts, broken in
``from the top down,'' like a shortstop's. This distresses
traditionalists, who see it as a byproduct of one-handed catching.
</P>
<P>
   Break-In and Maintenance
</P>
<P>
   Throw it in the Jacuzzi, the microwave or the dryer. Put it
under the mattress or drive over it with the car. Put it in a
bucket of water. Douse it with coffee. All of these have been
tried, with success, by major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But breaking in a glove has become relatively easy. For
starters, fine glove leather is not the rock-hard material it was
30 years ago, and some players now swear by the even softer
oil-tanned leather. And most major leaguers like their gloves stiff
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Hernandez, an All-Star with the Cardinals and Mets, broke
in his first baseman's mitt by first playing some catch and then
tightening the laces around the fingertips. Then he saturated the
pocket with water, tied two balls inside it and hung it in his
locker for a week. When he untied it, the fingertips curled inward
and were ``as hard as reinforced concrete,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Ryne Sandberg kneaded his glove over a pot of boiling water
until he noticed it getting softer. Tigers first baseman Tony Clark
will ``pull up a chair in front of the pitching machine and play
some fast catch.'' Pirates catcher Jason Kendall has the equipment
manager pound the pocket and hinge with various round-tipped wooden
mallets made especially for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In a fine example of symbiosis, Gillette has been supplying its
Foamy shave cream to major league clubhouses for years, and many
players now use it to condition their gloves. Bob Clevenhagen, the
Rawlings glove designer, says shaving cream is fine, as long as it
contains lanolin (the oil from sheepskin) but not much soap.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment and Superstition
</P>
<P>
   Angels shortstop Gary DiSarcina has used the same glove since
1988 and carries it on planes with him. Scott Erickson stanched a
losing streak in college by dying all his equipment black; now a
starter for the Orioles, he has Mizuno deliver him tan gloves,
which he dyes black. Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius switched
gloves in the middle of last season and went on an error streak
that may have cost him the Gold Glove; he is still agonizing over
finding a good new glove.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, only hours after giving away his ``gamer'' to a
member of the country-rock band Alabama, the Cubs' Doug Dascenzo
booted a ball in center field and lost his chance at the
consecutive games without an error streak for outfielders. ``Doug's
such a nice guy, but he wasn't thinking too much,'' Sandberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez, a rationalist by baseball standards, went through
too many gloves to get attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every glove is beautiful once it's broken in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing
</P>
<P>
   If there is an enduring tradition in baseball, it is the glove
makers' practice of signing minor leaguers to five-year contracts
for two gloves a season. It is a boon for poor farmhands and a
no-brainer for the companies, as most players, including All-Stars,
stick with the same glove company.
</P>
<P>
   When a player becomes a star, he may sign a two- or three-year
contract for gloves and cash, worth up to $100,000. Or the contract
may call for payment in kind: Mizuno gives Dodgers outfielder Devon
White five dozen high-end bats each year and DiSarcina a set of
golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   When a player gets famous, glove reps come calling. Pitchers are
prime targets, as the logos on the backs of their gloves get prime
TV exposure. Wilson lured Kerry Wood away from Zett this year, but
Zett feels it is on a good-luck string: closer Mariano Rivera's
Zett was in dozens of prominent photos of the Yankees World Series
celebration last year.
</P>
<P>
   Glove makers will go to great lengths to keep their marquee
endorsers happy, including overnight adjustments to gloves and
minute design changes. Still, some players are fickle. Roger
Clemens won three Cy Young awards in a Wilson, one in a Zett and
one in a Cooper. Roberto Alomar, the Cleveland Indians' second
baseman, was considering his fourth glove company this spring.
``He's all over the place,'' said one exasperated glove rep. &QL;

COMMENTARY: YUPPIE FOXHOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The moment we've been dreading has arrived. Put
down that Restoration Hardware penguin cocktail shaker. Climb out
of that Pottery Barn French Deco leather club chair. Finish up that
echinacea-flavored focaccia. Drop that titanium driver. (That means
you, Mr. President.)
</P>
<P>
   Yuppies are going to war. The most self-indulgent generation in
history is being asked to sacrifice by the most self-indulgent
commander in chief in history. The free-lunch president is trying
his best to give free-lunch Americans a free-lunch war. He
certainly doesn't want to spoil the party.
</P>
<P>
   So he has turned to the most Clintonian of all instruments of
war: air power. As the military expert Eliot Cohen has observed:
``Air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength
because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification
without commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Monica mess, the country engaged in an exhaustive and
exhausting debate about what matters in a leader. The consensus
seemed to be that policies do, not peccadilloes. And that character
is amorphous; there is public character and private character, and
only public character counts.
</P>
<P>
   That formulation worked when all the president who survived
impeachment had to do was oversee a wildly escalating stock market.
He may act like a dope sometimes, we thought, but he'll do.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he is suddenly overseeing a wildly escalating war.
And war is serious. It requires that we embrace the kinds of values
that Bill Clinton doesn't exemplify.
</P>
<P>
   In the ghastly light of bombs dropping on Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
the post-Monica conclusions about character look glib. As America
struggles to fathom Kosovo and as the wobbly Clinton team struggles
to decide on a policy, we're required to make a moral assessment of
the person running the war.
</P>
<P>
   The president is asking America to get involved in a conflict
for moral, rather than strategic, reasons. He is proposing to lead
us morally.
</P>
<P>
   This inspires admiration. But, even those who really like
Clinton would admit he does not inspire that ``we're all in this
together, we have nothing to fear but fear itself, we shall never
surrender'' sort of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   He seems lacking in passion and lacking in depth when he tries
to explain our involvement. In June 1995, he suggested that the
violence in the region was too ingrained to bother about. ``Their
enmities,'' he said before we entered the Bosnian conflict, ``go
back 500 years, some would say almost a thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, he said the opposite. ``Now, at the time, a lot
of people said: `Well, there's nothing you can do about it, Mr.
President. That's the way those people are. They've been fighting
for hundreds of years.' ... And I found out that in fact they had
been fighting on and off for hundreds of years, but there was more
off than on. And it was an insult to them to say that somehow they
were intrinsically made to murder one another. That was the excuse
used by countries and leaders for too long _ well, they're just
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The president who is always most concerned with rescuing himself
is now trying to rescue the Kosovar Albanians. He may have a
conflict of interest if he sends in ground troops. It would be hard
to save his skin and their skin at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Usually war entails old men sending young men off to die. But
this time, the young men in uniform seem like the adults being sent
off to fight by the child-man in the White House. In his
self-pitying interview with Dan Rather, Clinton compared himself to
Franklin Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela. But he came across like a
kid trying on the clothes of his elders, and betters.
</P>
<P>
   He wants, as usual, to have it all. In this instance, that means
war without death. Who's against that? The problem is, it doesn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tipping off the villains in Belgrade that he was only
willing to fight an air war, the president should have approached
the conflict with the same bravado he showed when Dick Morris told
him that polling indicated he should not go public with a
confession about Monica. According to Morris, Clinton replied,
``Well, we just have to win, then.''
</P>
<P>
   If the president had thought of Kosovo as a primary state, he
might have mustered the burning determination needed to scare
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at hordes of wretched Kosovar refugees on the borders, I
think only one thought: Well, Mr. President, we just have to win,
then.

COMMENTARY: BEYOND THE DIALLO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The killing of Amadou Diallo was cold-blooded, but it
probably wasn't murder. It appears that one or more of the officers
genuinely believed Diallo had a gun and that all four officers,
imagining danger when in fact there was none, panicked and began
firing.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the shooting was reckless and wrong. The
41 shots from the frightened cops turned a terrible mistake into a
hideous one. But even a hideous mistake by police officers who
think their lives are in danger falls short of the threshold for
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   There may or may not be evidence to sustain some lesser charge.
That will be determined at a trial. But there is a danger in
raising expectations about the outcome of the Diallo case too high.
If the officers are convicted of lesser crimes, or ultimately walk,
which is possible, the fury could be so great that it would detract
from the growing movement to correct the policies that made a
catastrophe like the Diallo shooting all but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The major benefit to emerge from the protests against the Diallo
shooting was not the indictment of the cops on murder charges, but
the fact that a spotlight was turned on the serious and systematic
police abuses that accompanied the Giuliani administration's
crackdown on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani insisted from the moment he took office
that police officers adopt a much more aggressive approach to
fighting crime and combatting the so-called quality-of-life
offenses. What he didn't do was insist that this citywide crackdown
be carried out by officers who were properly trained and closely
supervised. And he never gave enough attention to the idea that
law-abiding New Yorkers, including those who are black or Latino,
should always be treated with respect by the police.
</P>
<P>
   As crime rates plummeted, New Yorkers tended to overlook the
complaints about brutality and other forms of police misconduct.
But now, because of the publicity generated by the Abner Louima
case and the protests that followed the killing of Diallo, there is
a growing acknowledgment that while the plunging crime rate has
been a blessing, there is something terribly wrong about the ways
in which some police officers are conducting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And within law enforcement circles there is a steadily
increasing recognition that much of the problem can be traced to
the centerpiece of the administration's crime crackdown: the
heralded Comstat meetings at which police commanders are hounded to
get arrests and gun seizures up and crime statistics down.
</P>
<P>
   Comstat stands for computer statistics. The meetings frequently
featured the public humiliation of precinct commanders whose
statistics were subpar. The idea was to get results, period. Those
who could not get their stats in order would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally or not, the message conveyed by Comstat was that
the desired end of reduced crime statistics could justify virtually
any means.
</P>
<P>
   Said one cop: ``There was a whole `go-get-'em' mentality that
was shaky from the very beginning. The top police commanders were
under tremendous pressure. There never was a complete management
package, which would have insured that the cops were properly
trained and the community protected. We weren't told to be
even-handed and fair. All we had was the crime-reduction piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Innocent New Yorkers were stopped and frisked by the tens of
thousands. Thousands more were dragged off to jail for the most
minor offenses _ traffic violations, drinking in public, riding a
bicycle on the sidewalk. And there were alarming increases in the
amounts paid by the city to settle police brutality lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and his police commissioners knew or should have known
that their anti-crime strategies were dangerously flawed and likely
to lead to tragedy. They knew or should have known that many of the
officers sent out to engage the criminals and interact with the
law-abiding public needed more training and better supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The people who have protested these policies should not allow
their efforts to be derailed by whatever happens to the officers
who killed Amadou Diallo. The primary focus should be on the
efforts to change policies that, if left in place, will surely lead
to similar tragedies.

A NEW COLLISION OF WEST AND EAST

<P>
   For Americans who never gave much if any thought to Kosovo until
the terrible stories and images began to emerge of Albanians in
flight from an evil man called Slobodan Milosevic, it might have
come as something of a rude shock last week that other countries,
like Russia or Greece, seemed to actually see the United States and
NATO as the bad guys for bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his ever-shrinking Yugoslavia, after all, were
already responsible for infamous ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. And,
President Clinton explained, the United States had a moral
obligation to block them before the nastiness in Kosovo spilled
over and threatened Yugoslavia's neighbors, Europe itself and even
America's national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Russians were venting bitter fury at the United States as
Greek Orthodox leaders around the world condemned the bombing.
Russia demonstratively sent a spy ship into the Adriatic. The
ruling Synod of the Orthodox Church in Greece issued a statement
expressing ``pain at the military attacks against a heroic and
glorious Christian people, such as the Serbs.'' And very early on,
Greece was arguing within NATO councils for a quick end to the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions raise the question of whether there is in fact an
Orthodox world in the East that differs fundamentally from the West
in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks not
as a morally justified crusade against a clear and present evil,
but as a hypocritical Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In a poignant statement that circulated by e-mail among Orthodox
churches in America, Father Sava of the Serbian Orthodox Church _ a
church whose patriarch and bishops have consistently and
courageously opposed Milosevic _ bitterly derided the Western logic
for the bombing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic statements that the goal of this operation is to
prevent suffering of civilians are absolutely hypocritical and
tragic,'' the message said. ``President Clinton speaks sweet words
to the Serbian people while the bombers mercilessly destroy
schools, kindergartens and fill the hearts of children with hatred
against the peoples which they believed were their friends and
supporters of true peace and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such protests seem to support the thesis made popular by Samuel
P. Huntington of Harvard in his book ``The Clash of Civilizations
and the Remaking of World Order,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1996) that
the world is not moving inevitably toward Western values, as the
West's victory in the Cold War seemed to promise, but, on the
contrary, that it is moving toward a clash of cultures in which the
Western model is confronted by increasingly assertive civilizations
of the East _ Islamic, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Orthodox
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo certainly has all the elements of a case in point: Here
is a democratic West, its humanitarian instincts repelled by the
barbarous inhumanity of the Orthodox Serbs, going to war on behalf
of largely Muslim Albanians, all to a chorus of denunciations from
the Orthodox world. The substance of the conflict may not be clear
to Americans, who persist in believing that the rest of the world
is ``like us,'' or at least should want to be, Huntington said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in Europe and elsewhere people certainly recognize the
idea of dividing lines,'' he said. ``West Europeans know what West
Europe is; people in Orthodox countries know that however much they
want to be in the European Union, they are in a different world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one of the fascinating things is the changing
pattern of alliances. Russia and Greece are very close now. There
is a substantial Russian presence on the Greek part of Cyprus,
Russia provided missiles to the Cypriot government, and Greece
actively supported Serbia in the Bosnian wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scholars agree that there is something to the notion of
viewing the Balkans as a fault line between Western and Eastern
civilizations. But as in all efforts to impose comprehensive
templates on specific conflicts, there are also problems. For one
thing, the Serb-Albanian conflict is more territorial and tribal
than cultural or religious. Xenophobic passions have been fanned to
murderous levels by dictators in the East, the West and everywhere
else, whether under Hitler or Hutu warlords. Russia's reactions
reflect not only support for southern Slavic Orthodox brothers _
who were seen as adversaries in the Soviet era _ but also
resentment at no longer being treated as a superpower. Greek
support reflects not only a shared confession but a shared history
of domination by the Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's attractive to see this as a lab for Huntington's
thesis,'' said Jaroslav Pelikan, professor emeritus of history at
Yale. ``If you put Muslim, Orthodox and Catholic into the mix in
Croatia, Bosnia and now this, it does seem to fit. But it gets
confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of the journal Foreign Affairs,
where Huntington laid out his thesis in an article in 1993, agreed.
``I myself am always skeptical of such explanations,'' he said. ``I
find states somewhat less sentimental about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is hard to dispute that on the Eastern side, at least,
the anger at NATO's bombing is at least in part a reflection of a
deeper sense of difference and exclusion. The eastern borders of
NATO, Pelikan noted, are unmistakably similar to the division of
the Roman Empire under Diocletian in the 3rd century or the
separation of the Orthodox and Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   The recent expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the
Czech republic _ all Catholic or Protestant countries _ while
excluding the Orthodox states of Bulgaria and Romania affirmed a
sense that the West was promoting its own into its exclusive club.
The Poles, for example, have always insisted that their Catholicism
is their true membership card in the West, even if they are ethnic
cousins of the Russians.

   And while Greece is in NATO and the European Union, it has
always felt itself a junior member of the Western club, included
for geographical, not cultural, reasons. The Greeks know that they
were Byzantium, and that Orthodoxy's spiritual leader is a Greek
with the title of Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The
British philosopher Isaiah Berlin once noted that a trip from
Russia to Greece is not really going abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That history has served to inculcate in the Orthodox a sense of
uniqueness and otherness. The very word ``orthodoxy'' reflects a
sense that they are the bearers of the true faith against the
dissolute dilutions of Western Christianity and the apostasy of
Islam. Often in that history, the West has been seen as a greater
threat than the Islamic East. After the rampages of the Crusaders,
who went to fight Islam and incidentally sacked Constantinople, the
wisdom spread among Eastern Christians that ``better the turban of
the sultan than the tiara of the pope.'' Russia's medieval hero,
Prince Alexander Nevsky, entered national lore because he battled
the Teutonic Knights, even though he made peace with the Mongols.
Moscow's proclamation of itself as the ``Third Rome,'' and then as
the convener of the ``First International,'' reflected its
perception of itself as not only the capital of an empire, but of a
civilization, and it is as such that it still lays claim to a voice
in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the West is not seen as a conscious enemy, it is seen
to be blind or patronizing. When elements of nationalism appear in
the Russian Orthodox Church, clerics complain, it is seen to flow
from the very nature of a religion denied the intellectual
advantages of the Enlightenment or Reformation; when the same
elements surface among Irish Catholics or American Christian
fundamentalists, they are treated as exceptions to Western culture.
</P>
<P>
   These feelings run strong in the current conflict over Kosovo.
Though the large majority of Orthodox, including the Serbs, are
undoubtedly horrified at the ethnic purge under way against the
Albanians in Kosovo, there is also a powerful resentment against
NATO for what is seen as hypocrisy and condescension. Again and
again, the argument is heard that the West is not even aware of
Albanian actions against Serbian Kosovars in the recent past, or
that NATO did nothing to help the Kurds in Turkey, or the Tutsis in
Rwanda. There is fury that in its simplistic faith in the efficacy
of bombing, the West is only consolidating Milosevic's power and
demonizing the entire Serbian nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What irritates the Greeks is the unfairness of it, the
disproportionality, that the other point of view is not heard,''
said the Rev. Robert Stephanopoulos, dean of the Holy Trinity Greek
Orthodox Cathedral in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense that the Orthodox are quickly stereotyped and
quickly demonized,'' said the Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, ecumenical
officer of the Orthodox Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   What is alarming, he added, was that the demonstrators in
Moscow, Athens or Belgrade include not only ultra-nationalists, but
apparently average young people. Even among the most pro-Western
Russians and Serbs, he said, there is a growing resentment over
Washington's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me that this could be the beginning of a process
that will lead to a new polarization,'' he said. ``Once again,
between East and West.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hidden in the Microsoft Word document that
carried the Melissa virus around the world last week was an
innocuous serial number that helped federal agents identify the
computer responsible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The incident dramatically illustrated technology's growing power
for promoting both good and evil. The serial number itself _ known
in computer parlance as a global unique identifier _ lies at the
heart of a continuing controversy over tradeoffs between individual
privacy rights and the common good.
</P>
<P>
   The incident involving the Microsoft numbering system came just
weeks after the company's partner, Intel Corp., announced that it
was building serial numbers into each copy of its newest
microprocessor, the Pentium III. The announcement touched off
protests from privacy activists, who argue that such numbering
spells the end of anonymity in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But computer engineers say that as computer networks become
pervasive, similar numbering schemes are necessary for the networks
themselves and for the functioning of increasingly sophisticated
software systems.
</P>
<P>
   In response, privacy rights experts say that society has always
found ways to balance its needs with the right to individual
privacy. Published telephone numbers, for example, were later
offset by the option of unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Web has seen an explosion of ambitious marketing
organizations that have used the infrastructure in unforeseen ways
to build remarkably invasive profiles of Internet surfers. By
combining vast data bases with data-mining software to form
something resembling a vast vacuum cleaner, these new automated
systems are rapidly tracking as well as predicting human behavior.
What advertisers have been doing on a mass scale for decades is now
done one on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 threat today to privacy is not Big Brother, it's big
bucks,'' said Amitai Etzioni, a social scientist at George
Washington University, who is the author of the newly published
``Limits of Privacy'' (Basic Books).
</P>
<P>
   The invasiveness of such Internet data miners is balanced by the
power of the technology to help track criminals, as Richard Smith
showed last week by helping to identify the New Jersey man who was
arrested and charged with spreading the Melissa virus.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Smith, who is president of Phar Lap Software in
Cambridge, Mass., publicized the existence of the serial number in
Microsoft's Office documents. He raised ethical questions about the
company's intention in automatically recording such numbers in its
data base. After his announcement, Microsoft immediately said it
would stop the practice and erase the numbers _ which it said were
being collected in error _ from its data base. Last week the
company issued a software utility program enabling computer users
to delete the numbers from their documents.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a computer hacker in the constructive sense of the word
and an amateur sleuth, was able to compare the document's number
with those in other documents posted on the Web. His research paid
off quickly when late Thursday state and federal officials arrested
David L. Smith, a 30-year-old software programmer who lives in
Aberdeen, N.J. Smith was charged with three second-degree offenses,
including interference with a public service and conspiracy,
together carrying a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and
$480,000 in fines. Smith's name had appeared in one of the
documents found on a Web site maintained by a virus author who
called himself VicodinES.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic identity is both useful and increasingly necessary in
cyberspace, say technologists. ``I think the psychology surrounding
this debate is very interesting,'' said Jim Waldo, a Sun
Microsystems software engineer, who helped design an early
predecessor to Microsoft's software numbering system. ``People want
anonymity, but at the same time they want to track everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology tradeoffs won't necessarily become simpler as
technology becomes more sophisticated. For example, the Federal
Communications Commission has mandated that the nation's cellular
phones be able to provide location information to within 400 feet
by 2001. Because most 911 calls are now made from mobile phones,
such information is vital for emergency response teams.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy activists, however, are concerned that such information
will be misused by law enforcement. There is a simple solution,
they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general approach is to collect the minimum of personally
identifiable information possible and to explore new techniques
that permit authentication without identification, said Marc
Rotenberg, the director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy rights must be balanced against the common good, says
Etzioni, who worries about the growing computing powers of Internet
marketing companies. ``Their data bases have more information about
people than the Stasi secret police ever had about the East
Germans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he says, the dangers of allowing criminals and
terrorists access to unbreakable encryption software are
particularly high. The answer lies in striking a balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is becoming a world city,'' he said. ``Everything
happens in it from commerce to crime. To leave the role of
government out is foolish.''

   MCCARTHY-COLUMN (Los Angeles) _ The kids are coming to Clancy's
place to sit down for a hot for Easter Sunday dinner. If it weren't
for the ragged clothes on their backs, Clancy says, they'd look
like every other kid in this city going to Easter dinner with his
parents, but these children are not that lucky. They come to
Clancy's place _ the Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles _
because they have no other place to go. By Dennis McCarthy. (Will

   TOKYO _ Toshiyki Shimizu picked up a computer instruction manual
and frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' he complained. `` `Start button.' `Click.'
`Start menu.' `Device.' `Slot.' This is all English!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all English but pretty close. The actual first
sentence read: Sutaato botan (start button) o kurikku (click) suru,
sutaato menyuu (start menu) ga hyoji sareru.
</P>
<P>
   For many middle-aged and elderly Japanese, life these days is a
perplexing struggle through what seems like an endless language
school. In restaurants, in stores, in newspapers, on television and
in conversation with young people, they find themselves bewildered
by what seems like an explosion of foreign terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very annoying when you walk down the street and you can't
understand a word on the street signs,'' complained Hideko
Nabekura, an 82-year-old fireball of a woman, her arm gesturing
furiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my friends and I go to lunch these days, we can't
understand the menu,'' Mrs. Nabekura continued. ``One time I went
by myself, and I couldn't understand the items on the menu, so I
picked what seemed to be the cheapest. And the waitress said, `No,
it's a kid's meal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant menus are particularly challenging because, out of
snob appeal, they translate the sounds of foreign words rather than
the meanings. That results in offerings ranging from paati menyuu
(party menu) or happii awaa (happy hour) at the simpler end to
haabu-roosutochikin (herb-roasted chicken) and ruijiana sutairu
kurabukeeki (Louisiana-style crab cakes).
</P>
<P>
   English words may seem challenge enough, but for many Japanese
it is the menus of French restaurants that are the most baffling.
For example, l'Ecrin, a French restaurant in Tokyo, offers a fish
and shrimp dish that is ``poware ju do omaaru.'' The chef explains
that this is ``poilee, jus de homard,'' or sauteed in a special way
in the juice of lobster.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to the use the restroom, the less
cosmopolitan face similar challenges. One club writes the words
``Gentleman'' and ``Ladies'' in English calligraphy so curved and
fancy that almost all guests look a bit tentative making their
choice for the first time, and patrons of restaurant toilets often
must rely on the typical Japanese color coding of blue for men and
red for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what bathroom to go into from the signs,'' sighed
Hisako Sekine, an elderly housewife. ``You just have to look at the
pictures, or else see if one is blue and the other red.''
</P>
<P>
   The linguistic challenge is perhaps most pronounced in
computers. In the 19th century, Japan tended to come up with
traditional ways of writing new products or concepts, so that a
telephone was dubbed ``denwa'' or ``electronic talk.'' But while
China continues in that approach, terming a computer a ``electronic
brain,'' Japan in recent decades has shifted almost exclusively to
simply transcribing the sounds of foreign words, so that computer
in Japanese is ``konpyutaa.''
</P>
<P>
   This has some advantages for intellectuals who travel abroad and
communicate in English as well. But it is a bit overwhelming for
the person who sits down at a kiiboudo (keyboard) for the first
time and is told to move the mausu (mouse) and daburu-kurikku
(double-click) on the aikon (icon).
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at a computer book and I can't even figure out how to
get started,'' fretted Kimii Oishi, a 74-year-old woman who has
joined Tokyo's Grandma ``Pasukon saron'' (personal computer salon)
and was clutching a ``konpyutaa manyuaru.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' she added. `` `Manyuaru.' I don't even know
what that is. What's a manyuaru? I don't even know how to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   A manyuaru is a manual. And since there is already a word in
Japanese meaning the same thing, ``manyuaru'' reflects the tendency
to adopt foreign words even when their are already perfectly good
ones available in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Oishi said in some cases she feels more comfortable
with computer word transcriptions like mausu rather than
translations like ``nezumi,'' the Japanese word for a mouse or a
rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the image of a nezumi is rather dirty,'' Mrs. Oishi
said primly. ``So I think for that, it is better to use the English
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lesson for Americans is that when they are ready to
smash their computers for generating error messages, they should
realize that it could be worse. They could be
``toraburushyuutingu'' (trouble-shooting) using the Japanese
version of Microsoft Windows and getting ``herupu'' (help) like the
one beginning: ``What to do if the fairu (file) does not appear in
the correct doraibu (drive) and foruda (folder) of the open fairu
(file) daiarogubokkusu (dialogue box).''
</P>
<P>
   For all the image in the West of Japan as a country unusually
resistant to foreign currents, in fact Japan has long been an eager
importer of foreign terms. In serious discourse, about half of
expressions are originally Chinese, some imported more than 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western words came drifting in as well, and are usually written
in a separate alphabet called katakana, or sometimes directly in
Roman letters. Thus a single sentence of written Japanese can be a
mixture of four writing systems: Chinese characters, katakana,
Roman letters and a Japanese alphabet called hiragana.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of foreign words often seems aimed not at
facilitating communication but obstructing it. Just as Americans
might show off by using Latin ad infinitum, or by using French
words to demonstrate their savoire-faire, Japanese often use new
foreign words because they have the appiru (appeal) that not
everyone understands them.
</P>
<P>
   This snob appeal of foreign words has accentuated the generation
``gappu'' (gap) in Japan, for young people in the cities
enthusiastically adopt new words that leave the elderly befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandkids are speaking their weird way, I don't
understand it but I don't mind,'' said Fumiko Kawaguchi, an
87-year-old woman living in western Tokyo. ``But if they want to
talk to me, then I tell them that they'll have to speak Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the foreign words, there is no French-style political
opposition to imported words, and most people seem to accept them
as useful _ even if a growing number of elderly people feel left
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people and young people may live together in the same
house, but they are living in different worlds,'' mused Matome Ito,
a 64-year-old porcelain salesman in a small shop in Tokyo. ``For
young people, the whole life style is all American now. Their food
is different, and they can't even use chopsticks right any more.
Even the smell of the houses is different: The homes of older
people smell of fish and miso soup, and the kids' houses smell of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ito paused and sighed, and, perhaps getting carried away, added
sorrowfully: ``Young people are so different now, even their faces
have changed. They're like Westerners _ they don't have chins
anymore. I think maybe it's partly because they don't chew on
things like dried squid any more.''

importer of foreign terms. In serious discourse, about half of
expressions are originally Chinese, some imported more than 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western words came drifting in as well, and are usually written
in a separate alphabet called katakana, or sometimes directly in
Roman letters. Thus a single sentence of written Japanese can be a
mixture of four writing systems: Chinese characters, katakana,
Roman letters and a Japanese alphabet called hiragana.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of foreign words often seems aimed not at
facilitating communication but obstructing it. Just as Americans
might show off by using Latin ad infinitum, or by using French
words to demonstrate their savoire-faire, Japanese often use new
foreign words because they have the appiru (appeal) that not
everyone understands them.
</P>
<P>
   This snob appeal of foreign words has accentuated the generation
``gappu'' (gap) in Japan, for young people in the cities
enthusiastically adopt new words that leave the elderly befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandkids are speaking their weird way, I don't
understand it but I don't mind,'' said Fumiko Kawaguchi, an
87-year-old woman living in western Tokyo. ``But if they want to
talk to me, then I tell them that they'll have to speak Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the foreign words, there is no French-style political
opposition to imported words, and most people seem to accept them
as useful _ even if a growing number of elderly people feel left
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old people and young people may live together in the same
house, but they are living in different worlds,'' mused Matome Ito,
a 64-year-old porcelain salesman in a small shop in Tokyo. ``For
young people, the whole life style is all American now. Their food
is different, and they can't even use chopsticks right any more.
Even the smell of the houses is different: The homes of older
people smell of fish and miso soup, and the kids' houses smell of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ito paused and sighed, and, perhaps getting carried away, added
sorrowfully: ``Young people are so different now, even their faces
have changed. They're like Westerners _ they don't have chins
anymore. I think maybe it's partly because they don't chew on
things like dried squid any more.''

<P>
   By now, the whole world knows there's no hotter property than
companies that make Internet Web sites. Now here's something even
hotter: Web sites that make fun of companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sites allow disgruntled consumers to, well, express
themselves. For example, a site targeting Chase Manhattan Bank
features a cartoon of a half-naked little man in red shorts loping
across the top of the screen and dropping his drawers before
urinating on Chase's name. Mission accomplished, the little man
turns and smiles broadly at the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the companies aren't thrilled with this new
chapter in America's love affair with griping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most companies, we value customer feedback,'' said Ken
Herz, a Chase spokesman. ``But it's a pretty offensive Web site and
most of the information there is inaccurate. It's kind of pathetic,
frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has always been home to plenty of unvarnished brio,
and this new form of guerrilla consumerism is no exception. Much of
it is marked by a heavy dose of invective. Designers of the sites
might have chosen names like Chase-Gouged-Me.com or
AT&AMP;T-Isn't-Very-Nice.com, but most haven't. Instead, they use names
far too vulgar for breakfast time in the homes of readers of
high-toned newspapers like this one. (Terms sort of like
``stinks,'' only nastier.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the companies don't seem to see the humor in all this,
so they're fighting back with their most familiar weapon: money.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has been buying up the rights to names like
``ChaseStinks.com'' and ``IHateChase.com.'' Likewise, brokerage
giant Charles Schwab is protecting its flank by buying the rights
to dozens of unseemly domain names before angry consumers get their
hands on them. The same holds for General Electric, Hyatt and other
corporate heavyweights that pay between $70 and $120 to register
each domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating such preemptive strikes by Corporate America, Dan
Parisi, a Secaucus, N.J., lawyer and an operator of a pornographic
Internet site, has been stockpiling the rights to all sorts of
pejorative domain names, including those invoking well-known
companies like AT&AMP;T, Sears and Kmart, according to a recent issue
of American Banker. Parisi did not respond to repeated requests for
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are already plenty of places to complain about
companies. Some of the tamer ones have names like ``Untied
Airlines'' (for unhappy United Airlines fliers), ``Allsnake''
(featuring rants against Allstate Insurance) and ``I Hate
McDonalds'' (for those with indigestion courtesy of the golden
arches).
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who favor broad-brush venting can visit
complainline.com or grumbling.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies shrug off the advent of guerrilla consumerism.
Wal-Mart, the target of a Web site where a customer calling herself
Elaine describes the company as ``underhanded and dishonest,'' said
it has no interest in securing rights to offensive site names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that these sites are out there, but our feeling
is that our customers and associates are knowledgeable enough about
our company, services and reputation to see right through them,''
said Jessica Moser, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. The attitude of some
Wal-Mart customers bolsters that viewpoint. ``All you guys who
write in and complain about stupid things need to go get a life,''
a customer calling herself Kim wrote on the Wal-Mart site. ``What's
wrong with you? It's just a store.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla Web sites, of course, are not confined to the business
world. Last week, supporters of New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani erected Hillaryno.com, a site aimed at deflating a
possible run for the U.S. Senate by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Giuliani is said to harbor his own designs for the Senate, and the
site chides Mrs. Clinton for her slender government resume.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians are used to bruising, bare-knuckles criticism.
Many companies never experience full-blown invective until they
reach a certain size, and even then they remain skittish about
threats to their image. Consequently, some corporations have
launched robust counteroffensives to guerrilla consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the health club operator Bally Total Fitness filed a
trademark infringement suit against a site featuring an indecorous
variation on Bally's name. The suit was quickly dismissed and
experts on trademark law think few courts would back similar ones.
Trademark protection typically extends only to a company's
corporate name _ if an offensive adjective or verb is appended to
the name on a Web site, trademark protections evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this vast concern among corporations about whether a
domain name is a trademark or not,'' said Richard Forman, president
of register.com, a leading provider of Internet domain
registrations. ``But the courts have resoundingly ruled that a
domain name is not a trademark name.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is quite acceptable to Scott Harrison, a 23-year-old
promotions director for a Manhattan nightclub, who started the
anti-Chase site after the bank mishandled some of his accounts.
``Anything goes on the Internet, and my site is about free
speech,'' said Harrison. ``It's a way for me to literally tell the
entire world about why not to do business with this bank.''

FIGHTING MANDATORY DEPORTATION: VETERANS LEAD A NEW CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<P>
   Fear of crime and resentment against immigrants are perennial
themes of U.S. politics, and Congress touched both when it revised
American policy toward legal residents in the mid-1990s.
Non-citizens, even permanent residents, were made subject to
deportation for a wide range of crimes that had previously been
considered too minor. There was, at least according to immigration
officials, no flexibility in deciding whom to deport.
</P>
<P>
   The Draconian nature of the change brought immediate cries from
civil libertarians and advocates for immigrants, but so far court
challenges have had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new tactic is being pursued, and last month it reached the
floor of the Senate, where Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., spoke on
behalf of five legal residents who face deportation even though
they have served in the U.S. military, some of them in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zealousness of Congress and the White House to be tough on
aliens has successfully snared permanent residents who have spilled
their blood for our country,'' said Leahy.
</P>
<P>
   The five, and other veterans, have come forward as extreme
examples of the law's inflexibility. Some earned medals fighting in
Vietnam, and at least one is disabled as a result of service there.
Through legal challenges and a campaign for public attention, they
have targeted what they hope is the law's Achilles heel: its
rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   Can enforcement of the law stand up to public scrutiny in their
cases? If it can't, will exceptions be made? And if that happens,
they argue, wouldn't it undermine the notion of mandatory
deportation without exception?
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the case of Rafael Ramirez, a 35-year-old New
Yorker. Nine years after his honorable discharge from the Army as a
sergeant, he faces deportation to the Dominican Republic. His
offense: In 1990, just months after leaving the Army, he pleaded
guilty to possessing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez left the Dominican Republic 28 years ago, and today his
life is in the United States. He has a home in upper Manhattan's
Washington Heights, four children, a job and a small construction
business. His Army record as a truck driver in Germany and the
United States _ he enlisted in 1984 and left six years later _ is
unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington have been unmoved by such
cases, aware that making an exception can demolish the principle
behind its enforcement policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in the law that says if you are a veteran and
a criminal you are exempt from deportation,'' said Russell
Bergeron, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman in
Washington. ``It is inconceivable to me that someone who is willing
to die to defend the Constitution of the United States can then
turn around and violate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, of course, argues just the opposite: He says that when
he enlisted, his superiors did not ask where he came from, and that
his loyalty to the United States was assumed. His offense, he says,
hardly amounts to an assault on the Constitution, and the fact that
he was sentenced to five years probation and never went to prison
proves the point.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and veterans involved in the campaign don't argue
against using criminal behavior as grounds to deport people who
endanger American society. But they argue that the INS should only
go after hardened criminals. Even these cases, they say, should be
open to judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say they have no choice but to follow the
mandate of Congress. In the past two years, 106,442 immigrants have
been deported. But advocates for immigrants, their lawyers and some
members of Congress insist that the immigration service distorts
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Congress and the administration want to wash their
hands,'' said Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``Both are
responsible and, by neither one accepting responsibility, nothing
gets changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What Congress did in 1995 and 1996 was to expand the definition
of a felony and make all felonies and crimes of moral turpitude
punishable by deportation. It stripped immigration judges of the
power to reverse deportation orders. The INS, for its part, chose
to apply the law retroactively, although the law is not specific on
that point. The INS has also chosen to go after all convicted
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law goes too far,'' said Laura Kozuba, who heads an
anti-deportation group in Dallas. ``We want to change it for all,
but it seems particularly egregious to try to deport someone who
has served this country.'' She is married to Danny Kozuba, a
46-year-old kitchen installer, who has been ordered deported. He
came to the United States from Canada when he was 5 and was in the
Army from 1970 to 1973. He has been convicted of possessing
methamphetamines several times, the last in 1990, and spent three
years in a Texas state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the Clinical Law Center at New York University
School of Law, under the guidance of Professor Nancy Morawetz, are
focusing on several other veterans. One is Perry Gumbs, 35, of
Newburgh, N.Y., who was born in St. Kitts and served in a field
artillery unit during the gulf war. In 1995, he was convicted of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and served a year in jail. Another
is Ralph Hesselbach, who came to the United States from Germany
when he was 11 and was disabled while serving in Vietnam. At 49, he
is HIV. positive and has been convicted several times of possessing
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Morawetz said the INS could have chosen to leave
Hesselbach and Gumbs alone. They are not in jail now, are not
involved in crime and are not abusing drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in the law that says that the INS doesn't
have prosecutorial discretion,'' she said. ``Where does it say that
you have to deport everybody that you can deport? Why would you
want to?''

   ``The law goes too far,'' said Laura Kozuba, who heads an
anti-deportation group in Dallas. ``We want to change it for all,
but it seems particularly egregious to try to deport someone who
has served this country.'' She is married to Danny Kozuba, a
46-year-old kitchen installer, who has been ordered deported. He
came to the United States from Canada when he was 5 and was in the
Army from 1970 to 1973. He has been convicted of possessing
methamphetamines several times, the last in 1990, and spent three
years in a Texas state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the Clinical Law Center at New York University
School of Law, under the guidance of Professor Nancy Morawetz, are
focusing on several other veterans. One is Perry Gumbs, 35, of
Newburgh, N.Y., who was born in St. Kitts and served in a field
artillery unit during the gulf war. In 1995, he was convicted of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and served a year in jail. Another
is Ralph Hesselbach, who came to the United States from Germany
when he was 11 and was disabled while serving in Vietnam. At 49, he
is HIV. positive and has been convicted several times of possessing
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Morawetz said the INS could have chosen to leave
Hesselbach and Gumbs alone. They are not in jail now, are not
involved in crime and are not abusing drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything in the law that says that the INS doesn't
have prosecutorial discretion,'' she said. ``Where does it say that
you have to deport everybody that you can deport? Why would you
want to?''

INDUSTRY'S NEXT GROWTH SECTOR: MEMORY LAPSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., N.J.)   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The graying of America has created an emerging industry: a wave
of herbal and dietary supplements, books, courses and even clinics
aimed at healthy people who are having trouble remembering and
concentrating.
</P>
<P>
   On television commercials there is Annie Potts, who starred in
``Designing Women,'' extolling the wonders of that old standard,
One-a-Day vitamins, now reformulated by Bayer AG with the herbal
compound ginkgo biloba to sharpen memory. Hector Elizondo, star of
the hospital drama ``Chicago Hope,'' is pitching Warner-Lambert
Co.'s Quanterra Mental Sharpness Product, which also contains
ginkgo biloba.
</P>
<P>
   No elixir for forgetfulness exists. Yet even though ginkgo
biloba's ability to stimulate memory is unproved, sales of products
containing it reached $240 million in 1997, according to the
Nutrition Business Journal. The substance is only one of many
supplements said to re-energize aging minds. Such products can bear
hefty price tags, ranging from $30 to more than $100 for a month's
supply.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, giant drug companies are working on new medications
to treat Alzheimer's disease, a debilitating and thus far incurable
form of dementia; they may find a wider market among healthy people
concerned about memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line publishers have jumped into the market. Recent books
include ``Why Can't I Remember?: Reversing Normal Memory Loss''
(Avery Publishing Group), ``Menopause and the Mind'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster) and ``Brain Fitness: Anti-Aging Strategies for Achieving
Super Mind Power'' (Doubleday).
</P>
<P>
   On another front, start-up companies purvey memory training and
clinical services. One small concern, Neurocorp Ltd., operates four
Memory Centers of America and hopes to open 240 nationwide over the
next four years, marketing its services to executives, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market that is prime for picking,'' said Dr. Andrew
Monjan, chief of the neurobiology of aging branch of the National
Institute on Aging. ``It is a market that is interested in its
health. It caters to the underlying American desire for a fix.''
</P>
<P>
   An aging population is driving the memory business; by 2030, the
number of Americans over 65 is expected to nearly double. But
marketers also foresee potential customers in those in their 40s _
an age when experts say memory skills begin to decline for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, marketers are going after healthy people who
experience minor shifts in memory and concentration, changes such
as difficulty in remembering the names of new acquaintances or
where the car is parked. These symptoms of middle-age forgetfulness
are quite common and in the vast majority of cases are not linked
to serious illnesses like Alzheimer's disease, which affects a
relatively small proportion of the elderly. But growing national
awareness of Alzheimer's has made many healthy people fear that
forgetting a friend's name may signal bigger problems ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the mental processes that are involved in memory and
concentration are complex and not fully understood. Some people
find it easiest to retain what they read, for example. Others rely
on visual cues to remember. How well a person can concentrate, or
screen out other distractions, also plays a role in one's ability
to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James L. McGaugh, director of the Center for the
Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at the University of California
at Irvine, says that although the aging process does not really
damage memory, it does affect what has come to be known as
short-term memory, the ability to recall recently learned
information. It is very common for a middle-age person to forget
the name of a new acquaintance at a social event only to recall it
later while driving home, McGaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Such lapses can affect people in their 20s, though those in
their 40s more commonly experience them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a disease,'' McGaugh said. ``It is the natural
consequence of aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the cause or causes of such changes are not clear, some
scientists have hypothesized that factors like declining
cardiovascular health, failing vision and depression may play
roles. For women, studies suggest that the use of
estrogen-replacement therapies after menopause may improve memory.
</P>
<P>
   To work around forgetfulness, experts suggest techniques like
keeping lists or placing one's keys in the same place every day.
Keeping the mind active through work and reading can also help,
psychologists and other researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   No proven commercial memory loss remedies are available, and
some supplements may have harmful side effects if taken in excess.
Still, marketers are aiming a growing number of products _ the vast
majority of which have not received rigorous scientific scrutiny _
at those concerned about losing their mental edge.
</P>
<P>
   Michaela Griggs, manager for Bayer's One-a-Day vitamin brand,
says that the company's Memory and Concentration formula, which
includes ginkgo biloba, has proved particularly popular with people
between the ages of 35 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to feel as sharp as they possibly can,'' Ms. Griggs
said. ``I think they want to maintain as much as they've got and
improve it as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of ginkgo biloba products jumped last year after a 1997
report in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggested
that the substance might stabilize the loss of memory and reasoning
skills in people suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers have attacked the report as methodologically
flawed because it counted people as improved even though they might
have dropped out of the study before it was done. The study, which
was financed by a German producer of ginkgo biloba, did not address
the herbal compound's effects on healthy people concerned about
their mental skills.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Bayer consultant, Judith S. Stern, a professor of
nutrition at the University of California at Davis, said there was
no definitive evidence that ginkgo biloba would improve memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
plans to start a $15 million study soon of ginkgo biloba involving
those with mild dementia. The study could take five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Other supplements, whose efficacy has not been proved, are also
being marketed as remedies for memory loss and weak concentration.
Deep Thought and Brain Gum, for example, contain substances similar
to phosphatidylserine, a compound found in the brain that helps
regulate neural functions.
</P>
<P>
   Other products contain forms of the human growth hormone, a
compound secreted by the pituitary gland, which plays a role in
cell growth. Still others contain forms of DHEA, another hormone,
which is involved in the production of estrogen, testosterone and
other substances. The manufacturers of these products contend that
they can aid mental performance by supplementing levels of the
hormones, which begin to decline as a person ages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Federal Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of
1994, a company can say that an herbal product will improve a
consumer's sense of well-being or a function of the body like
memory if the manufacturer has evidence of that effect. But even
officials of the Food and Drug Administration acknowledge that the
law does not define what constitutes evidence, thus throwing the
door open to marketing campaigns containing unproven claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is one of the areas that need clarification,''
said Dr. Elizabeth A. Yetley, director of the FDA's Special
Nutritionals Office.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates product
advertising, has taken action against producers of herbal
supplements that claim their products cure diseases like cancer and
AIDS, the commission has taken no action against herbal products or
supplements that claim to reverse memory loss, Victoria Streitfeld,
an FTC spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the traditional drug industry, 20 pharmaceutical companies
including G.D. Searle, SmithKline Beecham PLC, Merck &AMP; Co. and Eli
Lilly &AMP; Co. are developing drugs that they hope will be new
medications for Alzheimer's disease, according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, a trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   McGaugh of the University of California at Irvine and other
experts say they believe that if such drugs prove effective and do
not have side effects, as existing Alzheimer's drugs do, they would
have great appeal for healthy, aging people seeking memory and
concentration enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where the big action is, the big focus and the big
payoff,'' McGaugh said. ``I believe that some of these companies
are definitely aiming at memory impairment that is not Alzheimer's
related.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Short, who runs a business called Grow Dendrites Forever
from her home in Lakeside, Mont., said she had recently provided
memory improvement courses for Centura Health, a network of
hospitals and doctors in Colorado, as part of its wellness program
for older patients. Neurocorp Ltd. of Tarrytown, N.Y., is trying to
get into the business of selling individually tailored memory and
mental sharpness programs through its Memory Centers of America
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to one of the company's two Manhattan centers was
memorable mainly for an absence of clients. The company's public
financial filings also suggest that it has yet to hit stride; in
1998, for example, only 292 clients, or fewer than one a day,
visited its four memory centers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that start has not dimmed the enthusiasm of the company or
its president, Vernon L. Wells. With a recent infusion of $2
million of venture capital, the company has started a nationwide
advertising campaign aimed at filling the hundreds of memory
centers it hopes to open. One intended audience is the corporate
executives who fear that their job performance may be slipping
because of declining memory skills or loss of the ability to
concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   A six-to-12-week program costs about $800 and emphasizes
computer training aimed at developing memory-related skills that a
person may not have fully used before, said Wells, who until 1997
was an executive at Quest Diagnostics Inc., a clinical testing
company in Teterboro, N.J. Clients first receive a medical
examination to screen for serious underlying physical problems, and
then they embark on a series of two- to four-hour computer sessions
that may be buttressed by doses of herbal supplements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trigger for many people is that this didn't used to be a
problem for me but it is now,'' Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Robin West, a professor of psychology at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, says it is possible to improve a specific
memory skill for a time but broad improvements are not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Objective tests won't show any improvement except on the
specific thing learned in a course, and that typically doesn't last
long,'' said Ms. West, who studies both the real and the perceived
effects of memory loss on the aging.
</P>
<P>
   Like other experts, she said she believes that for healthy
people the best techniques to help offset declining memory are
organizational tricks such as keeping lists, jotting appointments
down on calendars and making notes. A small study based on research
sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation found that both older and
younger people could more easily remember a list of words by
incorporating them into stories, according to a Harvard University
Medical School newsletter. In addition, to better retain what one
reads it may be necessary as one ages to eliminate distractions
like television or radio, Ms. West said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, she added, there is no magic memory bullet,
though she offers Neurocorp and all the other companies hoping to
develop one the best of luck. ``Hopefully,'' Ms. West said, ``they
will prove me wrong.''

   JUPITER, Fla. _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up as if he'd just seen
a down-the-pipe fastball. Expecting yet another, ``Can you hit 70
home runs again?'' question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis
Cardinals slugger was asked if he'd like to reverse roles and pose
questions to other people for a change. ``That's great,'' he said,
clearly relieved. ``I love it!''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire came up with one question for a dozen people from
baseball and beyond. Some declined to answer _ President Clinton
passed on, ``Are you glad Sammy Sosa and I took some pressure off
you last summer?'' _ but most everyone enjoyed giving the most
interviewed man in sports a break. With today being Opening Day, it
might be his last. McGwire's questions and his subjects' answers
follow.

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Rich DeLucia of the California Angels has
only a 38-50 career major league pitching record, but he owns
McGwire, yielding him just a single and double in 19 at-bats. This
begged McGwire's question, ``Why don't you ever throw me anything
over the plate?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   DeLucia: Last year there were 70 balls over the plate, I know
that. I'm not stupid. I just try to get ahead of him and then move
the ball off the plate. If you miss early and you have to come over
the plate, you're in trouble. I throw him down and away hard stuff
and belt-high up and in. But believe me, out of all those at-bats,
I'm sure I got lucky sometimes.

<P>
   Brooks: Tell Mark he'd better buy his own record label. That's
the best way to do it. But tell him not to quit his day job. He's
too good at what he does.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Tim Forneris, a 22-year-old computer analyst
from Collinsville, Ill., and part-timer on the Cardinals grounds
crew, retrieved McGwire's record-breaking 62d home run ball last
Sept. 8 _ and baffled some by giving it to McGwire rather than
auctioning it off for $1 million or more. But Forneris didn't go
away empty-handed: A Chrysler dealer gave him a fully loaded red
minivan with ``No. 62'' license plates. McGwire wanted to know,
``Hey, how's the van running?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Forneris: It's running awesome! The only problem is it's much
bigger than my old car. I've had a tough time parking and I hope I
don't cut people off and cause an accident.
</P>
<P>
   I met Mark at a dinner a few days after they gave me the van.
You might remember he got a '62 Corvette the night he hit 62, and
he was telling me that he was having a hard time fitting into it _
he's so big. I told him, ``Next year in St. Louis, we can
car-pool.''
</P>

down-and-in fastball that McGwire slammed for No. 62. McGwire
asked, ``Was that as good a pitch as I thought it was?''(END

<P>
   Trachsel: It was actually a little lower than I'd planned. We'd
had success and other teams had had success pitching him up and in,
and I was trying to do that that night, too. I pretty much missed
my spot and he got it.
</P>
<P>
   The attention hasn't been bad at all. Hey, he couldn't have done
it without me.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Joe McIlvaine, now a Minnesota Twins
executive, used the Mets' No. 1 overall pick in the 1984 draft on a
future washout, Shawn Abner, instead of McGwire, who slid to the
Oakland A's nine picks later. McGwire asked McIlvaine a question
Mets fans surely want answered as well: ``Why didn't you take me
No. 1?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine: We called the night before the draft and talked for
45 minutes with his father. We never once mentioned money. Our
question was, ``If we draft your son, would you have any interest
in signing with the New York Mets?'' They kept saying: ``We need
more time. We're not sure. We like the West Coast. . . . '' They
just wouldn't say they'd be interested in signing with us. Do I
regret not taking him? Of course. He was my pick. I loved him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Gene Hackman is McGwire's favorite actor.

``Could you manage a baseball team as well as you coached the team

   Hackman, clearly baffled: I wouldn't want people to think I
actually know how to coach a basketball team. I'm just an actor who
plays a part.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)When McGwire hit No. 62, the Cubs' first
baseman, Mark Grace, patted the slugger's behind as he jogged by.
The two occasionally golf together in the offseason _ prompting
McGwire to ask, ``Hey, how many strokes you gonna give me the next
time we play?''(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Grace: Hmmm. Because of his celebrity status, I'll have to give
him a celebrity stroke. But only one celebrity mulligan per round.

like his driving. You can print that.

   WASHINGTON _ At first blush, last week's news from the Medicare
and Social Security trustees was good. The economy over the last
year has been so strong, actuaries found, that even with no changes
in the law, the Medicare system should be solvent until 2015, seven
years longer than previously expected, and Social Security reserves
should be sufficient to pay full retirement benefits until 2034,
two years more than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, President Clinton and Republican leaders were quick to
say that the wise course would still be to resolve their
differences and act this year to put Medicare and Social Security
on sound footing. But the truth is that for Congress, now on recess
for Passover and Easter, the news was political manna. It made the
problem of the insolvency of the two largest and most popular
federal programs seem less urgent. And it provided an excuse for
postponing tough decisions until after the next election.
</P>
<P>
   But data buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the
matter cannot be put off indefinitely. The figures showed how the
ratio of people of retirement age (who receive Medicare and Social
Security benefits) to those of working age (who pay the taxes that
finance the benefits) will rise after the baby boomers begin to
retire. This almost certainly means that sooner or later taxes will
have to be increased or retirement benefits reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, for example, there will be 210 people age 65 and over
for every 1,000 people ages 20 through 64. By 2030, the number of
Americans of retirement age will rise by 69 percent to 354 for
every 1,000 people of working age. And by 2075, it is projected
that the figure will nearly double.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Soon after the bombing of Yugoslavia began
the week before last, Italy's NATO representative, Amadeo de
Franchi, pointed out in an alliance meeting that the airstrikes
were causing some difficulties for his government.
</P>
<P>
   There was the threat of a refugee crisis on Italy's borders. And
there were worries that tourists might cancel reservations in
Venice, just a short drive from one of the main NATO bases.
Perhaps, he said, the alliance would consider a bombing pause over
Easter?
</P>
<P>
   A senior alliance official noted that such a break would have to
be extended through the Orthodox Easter 10 days later and asked,
``Can you square your conscience with a bombing pause that gives''
President Slobodan Milosevic ``10 extra days to kill people?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was dropped, but the incident illustrates an important
aspect of the campaign: NATO is waging war by committee. The
19-member alliance operates by consensus, and its members run the
gamut from the hawkish Britain to the somewhat skittish Italy, a
country just 40 miles across the Adriatic from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The need for consensus has left an unmistakable imprint on the
alliance's military strategy, causing it to take a gradual approach
to the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats insist that NATO's bombing strategy has enabled the
alliance to achieve a remarkable degree of unity, which is
critically important since it is planning for weeks more of
bombing. Decisions that used to take the cumbersome alliance three
days are now, they boast, being made in a mere 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say, however, that NATO's carefully calibrated campaign
may backfire by prolonging the war and providing Milosevic with
more time to exploit fissures among the allies.
</P>
<P>
   It has also, they say, diminished the effectiveness of the
airstrikes, by reducing the element of surprise and limiting the
list of targets. That is an especially serious constraint since
NATO has all but rejected the use of ground troops and is relying
exclusively on air power to roll back the Serbian advance.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Saturday's early morning cruise missile attack on the
headquarters of the Serbian and Yugoslav Interior Ministries in
downtown Belgrade, NATO's attacks are a far cry from the 1991
Persian Gulf war, in which communications, command post and
political headquarters in central Baghdad were hit on the first
night of the campaign, and then repeatedly pounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military action is not consistent with the rhetoric,''
said Buster Glosson, the retired Air Force general who ran the air
campaign against Iraq during the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their plans require the approval of the political arm of NATO,
the military arm of NATO and then officials in Washington. With all
those bottlenecks, the chance of success is small.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, politics has been a big part of NATO's planning from
the outset. Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander whose
crisp and confident briefings are well known to television viewers,
developed the military plan. But it is the political arm of the
alliance, the North Atlantic Council, that has the final say over
which targets are struck and in what general sequence.
</P>
<P>
   CHAIN OF COMMAND
</P>
<P>
   Focus on Diplomacy as Much as Force
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's most powerful members appear determined to resist
Milosevic's brutal campaign against the Kosovo Albanians. The
British are the most outspoken, but President Jacques Chirac of
France has also condemned the Milosevic regime as a threat to
security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, has supported allied
firmness and recently rebuffed the effort by the Russian prime
minister, Yevgeny Primakov, to negotiate a halt in the allied
bombing without Yugoslavia having to provide any major concessions
in return.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the three-stage plan that NATO ultimately approved put as
much emphasis on sending diplomatic signals as on crushing its
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage was based on the calculation that a few bombing
strikes might be enough to persuade Milosevic to stop the attacks
in Kosovo and to agree to autonomy for the province. It
concentrated on air defense sites and stayed away from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's plan had never envisaged beginning the air campaign
with a massive application of air bombardment,'' Air Marshal Sir
John Day, the deputy chief of the British Defense Staff, said last
week. ``This was not the start of a war where we were determined to
win as quickly and as harshly as possible to overwhelm his entire
military forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Under NATO's original concept, this phase was to be followed by
a bombing pause to see if the Yugoslav president was persuaded. If
not, the planes were to attack command centers and forces involved
in attacking the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As limited as this approach was, officials said the original
plan was even more restrictive. But as the U.S. special envoy,
Richard Holbrooke, set off on one last attempt in late March to get
Milosevic to budge, the NATO representatives met in the carpeted
conference room of the sprawling allied headquarters near the
Brussels airport to consider a U.S. proposal to add a bit more
punch to the early stages of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke wanted to take news of this decision with him before
he went on to Belgrade. Allied diplomats agreed, with the provision
that they be consulted on the military decision if the moment came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Holbrooke has everything he needs from NATO,'' NATO's
secretary-general, Javier Solana, said just before the Holbrooke
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic remained unswayed. As NATO began its first attacks,
alliance officials boasted that there would be no ``sanctuary'' for
the Yugoslav leaders. In fact, NATO leaders thought a bombing raid
or two might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped that he would quickly get the message and not
continue his plans,'' Day said. ``We hoped for a rapid political
solution and that it would not be necessary to move from one phase
of our operation to the next, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serbian forces ruthlessly began to push ethnic Albanians out
of Kosovo, however, the first phase of airstrikes appeared to be
pitifully inadequate, and the alliance shifted after a quick
consultation to the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``For NATO, going from phase one to phase two without a pause
was pretty big stuff,'' one alliance military expert said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the alliance's few victories were greeted uneasily by some
members, particularly those whose populations still harbor
unpleasant memories of European wars. When a Dutch pilot shot down
a Yugoslav MIG fighter jet, the authorities declined to release his
name and his commander forbade him to paint the black silhouette of
the ``kill'' on the fuselage of his aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGIC SHIFTS
</P>
<P>
   The Winding Route to Escalation
</P>
<P>
   As Serbian forces relentlessly pressed their attack, diplomats
found themselves confronting a decision they hoped they would never
have to face: whether to authorize the bombing of government
ministries in Belgrade, military factories throughout Yugoslavia
and other infrastructure listed in the third phase of their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Enlarging the target list required another meeting of the NATO
representatives, 19 of them now, since Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary had joined the alliance in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic seemed to be doing his best to head off an escalation
in the bombing campaign by using the Russians to launch a new
diplomatic initiative and receiving church officials in Belgrade, a
not-so-subtle appeal for an Easter pause, as well as sympathy from
Italy and Greece. And anxiety was growing in the Czech Republic
about the airstrikes, although its representative to NATO remained
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is reading very carefully the cohesion of the alliance and
trying to identify cracks and exploit them,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Naumann, the German officer who heads NATO's Military
Committee, sought to set the stage for an expansion in the target
list by telling diplomats in a closed-door meeting that military
plans usually stand up only until the battle begins, and then they
have to be adapted.
</P>
<P>
   With some allies nervous about the attacks on Yugoslavia's
infrastructure, a compromise was hammered out last week, which gave
Clark, the allied commander, more targeting flexibility, but not
the full range of targets in the third phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably a lot of different kind of things that
General Clark wants that he is not getting, whether it is
particular types of aircraft, as well as some specific targets he
is not yet authorized to strike,'' a senior NATO diplomat said.
``Overall, he is quite satisfied and impressed with the unity of
the alliance and its ability to make rapid decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark used his new flexibility early Saturday morning when NATO
sent cruise missiles flying at two Interior Ministry buildings in
the heart of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The strike showed that the alliance was prepared to attack
forces leading the campaign against the Kosovo Albanians and to
pierce the heart of the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   One senior alliance official, however, was skeptical of the
military utility of the cruise missile attack. By the time it
occurred _ 10 days into the air campaign _ there had been several
press reports that Clark had been pressing the alliance to put the
Interior Ministry buildings on his target list. Without the element
of surprise, it was very unlikely that the Serbs would be using the
buildings when they were attacked, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A DIFFERENT WAR
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Lessons Unused in Belgrade
</P>
<P>
   Some Air Force officers who commanded forces during the Persian
Gulf war say more broadly that NATO has moved too slowly to take
war to the enemy capital, and also allowed its fears of losing
pilots to make it overly cautious in attacking Serbian forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening night of the Gulf war, allied warplanes headed
straight for downtown Baghdad. Glosson insisted that the allies
should have done more of the same in Belgrade, starting with key
nodes for controlling the nation's air defenses and communications
links in the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would also have taken out the television station, part of
the electricity and certainly some of the locations of his
political stalwarts,'' he added in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NATO officials said the attacks on Belgrade remain a
sensitive matter for members worried about civilian casualties, as
well as the perception that the alliance was waging a war against
the Yugoslav people, and not just the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgrade is not going to be Baghdad,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential targets, officials said, are unlikely to be hit
at all. Milosevic's government palace, for instance, was scratched
from the target list because it was a cultural landmark.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, the NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, suggested that
NATO might not try to destroy Yugoslavia's ability to broadcast
television programs. That was one of the first orders of business
in the Gulf war. Asked why Belgrade's television was still on the
air, Shea said, jokingly, that that was a decision for Belgrade
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials hope that their caution will serve a large goal:
enabling the alliance to hang together long enough to wage an air
campaign that could take weeks, perhaps months.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox, however, is that the self-imposed constraints may
end up prolonging the bombing, adding to the risk that the alliance
may eventually begin to splinter under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO diplomat said, ``This is an alliance effort and we
have to maintain a consensus for such a high-risk operation.''

TWO DISTINCT PEOPLES WITH TWO DIVERGENT MEMORIES BATTLE OVER ONE
LAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: See Also Kosovo-Clinton, Kosovo-Fla, Kosovo-Rebels,
Kosovo-Legal, Kosovo-U.S.)   By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conflict between Serbs and Albanians, currently embodied by
the sight of Albanian families desperately fleeing Serbian pursuers
in Kosovo, has a very long history that is deeply felt, if
selectively recalled, by those condemned to live it. At the same
time it has never been much understood or appreciated beyond the
southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1780 while Edward Gibbon, the British historian, was sailing
down the Adriatic and regarding the high peaks of the southeastern
shore, he wrote that here was an area lying ``within sight of
Italy, which is less known than the interior of America.'' Yet, as
the contemporary British historian Norman Davis has observed, no
lands have ``suffered more from the whims of international
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In this century alone, the Serbs and Albanians have had to
contend with Turkish, Nazi and Italian forces of occupation, while
also contending with and confronting each other. Since 1987, when
Slobodan Milosevic, now the Yugoslav President, first began
exploiting and inflaming the historical rivalries of Albanians and
Serbs, many observers predicted that Kosovo could well become the
site of the deadliest violence seen in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as NATO's bombs fall and long lines of refugees straggle
over mountain passes, the issues pitting Serbs against Albanians,
which preoccupied and bedeviled the European powers for the latter
part of the 19th century, have once again grown beyond the
crenelated landscape of mountains and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Stimulated by Milosevic's policies, Serbs and Albanians have
retreated to their own distinct politics, sharpening the
differences in their already diverging historical accounts of
Kosovo and the region.
</P>
<P>
   Until the recently provoked flight of Albanian families, there
were 1.8 million Albanians in Kosovo, the province of Serbia where
ethnic Albanians accounted for 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Serbian view of Kosovo could be summarized as
follows: It is the nation's holy land, first settled by their
ancestors in the seventh century. Medieval Serbian kings were
crowned there. Important shrines of the Serbian Orthodox church
still dot the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it was the site of the battle of Kosovo Polje,
where in 1389 the Turks defeated the Serbs and set the nation on
its course of 500 years of resistance to Ottoman rule. This event
is at the heart of the Serbian national myth, and as the writer
Noel Malcolm observed in his recent book, ``Kosovo, a Short
History,'' Serbian writers have often compared the loss at Kosovo
to the crucifixion of Christ, and its reconquest in 1912 to
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that a Serbian view takes account of Albanians at
all, the Albanians are portrayed as having sided with or served the
Ottoman Turks, and they are said to have taken over properties left
behind when Serbs fled northward, particularly in the 17th and 18th
centuries. The Serbs claim that in the years of Ottoman rule, the
Turks favored the Albanians, most of whom are fellow Muslims,
installing them as landlords and allowing them to exploit and
humiliate Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians see things differently. They claim that their
ancestors, the ancient Illyrian tribes, who provided fighting
legions for the Greek and Roman empires, were in Kosovo for
centuries when the Serbs first arrived from what is now southern
Poland. Moreover, they claim that Albanians had a long record of
fighting the Turks, and that in fact Albanians had fought as allies
of the Serbs at Kosovo Polje. They point out that their national
hero, Scanderbeg, spent 20 years in the 15th century warring
against the Ottoman Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians, who did not have their own state until 1913,
stress that they are an overwhelming majority in the area and that
they have attained such numerical supremacy despite longstanding
efforts of governments in Belgrade to displace them, among these an
attempt in 1926 to sponsor Serb settlements. The Albanians recall
how in the period between the two world wars mosques were seized,
land was confiscated, old deeds invalidated and some Albanians were
forcibly put on trains and deported to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, by their conduct in the skies over Serbia, it
seems clear that the great Western powers have found the Albanians'
case persuasive. But in Kosovo itself it is the Serbian view of
history that is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   Despite living in close proximity over the ages, Albanians and
Serbs are quite different from each other. In the case of the
recent fighting in Bosnia, Eastern Orthodox Serbs, Bosnian Muslims
and Catholic Croats had different religions but spoke the same
language. The Serbs and Albanians are linguistically alien.
Albanian is not a Slavic tongue nor does it have recognizable links
to any other European language. Seventy-five percent of Albanians
are Muslim, with the remainder divided between Orthodox and
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Though the young Albanians of Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
would be indistinguishable in dress from their Serbian counterparts
in Belgrade, their elders often still maintain distinctive garb,
with men prizing flowing mustaches or wearing white felt conical
caps. In Albania, particularly in the north, clans remain extremely
important in determining who can and cannot be married and blood
feuds are still carried out under an ancient code called the law of
Lek. Currently, there are eight million to nine million Serbs, most
living in Yugoslavia's two republics, Serbia and Montenegro. There
are also a few Serbs in Croatia and Macedonia. There are virtually
none in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Albanians, some six million live where they have for
generations, in what are now three contiguous countries. There are
close to four million in Albania, a very poor country that in
Albanian is called ``Shqiperia,'' which means ``land of the sons of
the eagle.'' In Macedonia, the number of Albanians is officially
given as half a million, or 23 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Such figures make these two peoples rather sizable in terms of
Balkan demographics. Both Albanians and Serbs are outnumbered by
Greeks, but they are more numerous than the Croats, Slovenes,
Macedonians, Montenegrins and Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian birth rate has been high everywhere, and in Kosovo
it is the highest in Europe. There, 70 percent of the Albanians
were under 30 years of age. Very high birth rates have also been
recorded in Albania proper and among the Albanians of Macedonia.
Meanwhile in Yugoslavia, the non-Albanian population has been
steadily falling.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic government has cited the statistics to arouse the
Serbian population. Last July, for example, Serbia's Minister for
Family Affairs, Rada Trajkovic, a former doctor in Pristina, called
Albanian women ``child-bearing machines'' who she claimed did not
always know the names of all their children.
</P>
<P>
   Such reports have reinforced Serbian fears that while their
nation has been thwarted in its dreams of securing a Greater
Serbia, it may yet find itself confronted by a populous Greater
Albania consisting of all the territory where Albanians form
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   A significant difference between the two peoples arises from the
ways in which their respective nationalisms developed. While the
Serbs, who had kingdoms and dynasties during the Middle Ages,
experienced a national rebirth in the early 19th century similar to
that of many other European peoples, the Albanians did not begin
the process until much later.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians consider the Albanians, regardless of where they
live, to be the last of the European peoples to be undergoing the
sort of national resurgence through which much of Europe passed in
the wake of the Napoleonic era.
</P>
<P>
   What is called the ``Albanian national awakening'' began in
1878. As the Congress of Berlin was about to convene to discuss a
remapping of the Balkans as Ottoman power was receding, a group of
Albanians based in Prizren, in Kosovo, wrote to Benjamin Disraeli,
the British Prime Minister at the time, to urge that Albanian
interests be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was crushed when the German Chancellor, Bismarck,
flatly declared that there was ``no such thing as an Albanian
nationality.'' But the Albanian Question, meaning what should be
done with this distinct group of people then aspiring to have its
own nation state, had been placed on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three decades, as Albanians struggled against
Ottoman rule, the debate raged. In 1908 they met and chose the
Latin script over either cyrillic or Arabic letters, and demanded
that schools teach in Albanian rather than Turkish. There were
several armed uprisings to challenge the Ottomans, and by 1911 the
Albanians were in full-scale rebellion. The following year, the
combined armies of Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece drove Turkish forces
back to the walls of Constantinople in what became known as the
First Balkan War.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing peace talks in London in 1913, the great powers
agreed on the creation of an Albanian state as an independent
sovereign hereditary principality with a prince to be chosen later.
They also did not get around to setting the country's northern
border with Serbian Kosovo, something that was not done until 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the anti-Ottoman alliance collapsed over territorial
claims and Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece in the Second
Balkan War. In the fighting, Serbia, which long craved an Adriatic
port, sent forces into Albania. The Austro-Hungarians who were in
control of Croatia and feared such encroachment sent an ultimatum
to Serbia, and when _ in a prelude to World War I _ the Austrians
were backed up by the German Kaiser, the Serbs reluctantly
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the European powers selected Wilhelm du Zeid, a
35-year-old army captain, to be Albania's ruling Prince. He arrived
in March 1914, and left six months later without establishing
control over much of the turbulent country, which for years
continued to be wracked by anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the next seven decades, for Albania proper, it was
not Serbs who would pose their greatest problems. After a period of
internal skirmishing came the rule of Ahmet Zogu, who proclaimed
himself King Zog. Then in 1939 Mussolini's Italian troops invaded
and annexed the country.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, after Mussolini was killed, German paratroops
occupied Albania, while Communists and Albanian nationalist
guerrillas and Greek forces fought the Nazis and each other. At the
end of the war, Enver Hoxa, the leader of the Communist resistance,
attained power and imposed a bizarre Stalinist and Maoist tyranny
that cut the country off from its neighbors and much of the world
for more than four decades, leaving it ill prepared for the world
after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the tension between Albanians and Serbs became
Kosovo. Even there, the conflict was relatively dormant until
Milosevic stirred up hostilities in 1989 by revoking the autonomous
status that Kosovo had enjoyed in Serbia. Ethnic Albanian Communist
leaders were dismissed and a full-scale propaganda campaign was
orchestrated by Milosevic against ethnic Albanians, leading to the
firing of their teachers and the closing of their schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian majority of Kosovo then entered into a
campaign of passive resistance, setting up its own schools, and a
shadow government before the armed resistance, called the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which seeks independence for the region, came into
full view last year.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ A top commander of the Kosovo Liberation
Army made an impassioned plea Saturday for NATO countries to supply
weapons and ammunition to his guerrilla force, which he said has
been hampered in its losing battle to defend Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians from Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, who goes by the name Drini, said in an interview
that his forces desperately need military supplies if they are to
maintain their resistance and defend civilians trapped in parts of
Kosovo. He also called for NATO to conduct airdrops of food to the
ethnic Albanian population stranded in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they gave us the military support, we could do much more,''
Drini said, speaking from central Kosovo by telephone in the early
hours of Saturday morning. ``We are doing tactical maneuvers to try
and save the population from the Serb army. But where we are using
a unit of 50 to 60 men they are up against a whole division, with
tanks, artillery and infantry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than a week of NATO bombing, the Serbian air force
is still putting up MiG fighter jets to bomb villages, Drini said,
and is making extensive use of tanks and heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   He said bad weather had prevented NATO bombers working with full
effectiveness. ``Even God turned its back on the Albanians,'' he
said ``For 12 days there have been no clear skies, and we have not
had airstrikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its NATO allies, which have themselves
acknowledged that the weather has seriously hampered attacks by
high-flying allied jets, have so far dismissed the idea of
supplying the guerrilla army.
</P>
<P>
   Drini said that his forces are now fighting on several fronts
around Kosovo and coming under heavy pressure as ammunition and
food was running low. Supply lines from Albania have been cut, he
said. The food situation was so desperate that the Kosovo
Liberation Army was having to use its own rations to feed the
thousands of displaced civilians inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian situation is terrible,'' he said. ``People
are under the open skies and it is now raining. There is a lack of
food and we are giving out our reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Drini, who himself was wounded this week, said that they had
come across three separate incidents of mass killings of civilians
by Serbian forces in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   He said 150 people, including women and children, had been found
killed in Izbica, in northern Drenica region, northeast of the
Kosovo capital, Pristina. Another 70 had been killed in the village
of Pusto Selo and 34 people in Juovic.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents could not be independently confirmed but Drini, a
figure well known to foreign journalists and verifiers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has proved a
reliable source of information in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``MiG-29s fired on the village of Baigora, hitting a school
yesterday,'' he said. ``There were 200 people there, but
fortunately casualties were low. Only three people were killed and
27 wounded.'' Baigora lies in a heavily contested area in northern
Kosovo, just east of the town of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Drini said that while NATO bombing was succeeding in cutting
Serbian military supply routes and would inevitably demoralize the
military, ground troops were the only answer now to contain the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is exhausting the big war machine of the Serbs,'' he
said. ``But air power never solves the problem. We see NATO ground
forces as the only way to solve the problem in Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO knows that, and if they can help us with military
materiel and supplies, we will be able to make enough trouble for a
month until they can come in.''
</P>
<P>
   His call for assistance is not the first from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and the message is now reaching Western
governments, diplomats and foreign military observers here said.
</P>
<P>
   Drini, a 38-year-old with 20 years of military schooling and
experience in the former Yugoslav People's Army, is emerging as one
of the guerrilla army's top military men. Until recently a
commander of one of the six zones in Kosovo, he was promoted two
weeks ago to join the General Staff of the rebel army, which seeks
independence for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He and others with solid military experience have been credited
over the last year with transforming the KLA from the ragtag
peasant force into a well-coordinated fighting force. Better
trained and equipped than before, the guerrillas have engaged in
serious fighting in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   It successfully fought off the Serbian military in a battle in
northern Kosovo in December and in recent fighting has managed to
inflict some damage and casualties on attacking forces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains vastly outgunned. NATO shot down one MiG-29 jet
Thursday, he said, but the Serbian air force still had five more
jets in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Drini also passionately pressed an urgent request issued earlier
this week by the chief of staff of the guerrilla army for countries
to provide humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is burning all around us,'' Drini said. ``There are
convoys of people stuck, trying to flee to Albania and Macedonia.
They are fleeing for their lives. I cannot describe to you the
state they are in. They are like zombies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While over 200,000 people have now fled into neighboring
countries, an equal number of people are still stuck inside Kosovo
trying to flee, according to the State Department spokesman, James
P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, European observers and diplomatic staff have been at the
border region in Macedonia this week to assess the refugee
situation and report back to their respective organizations and
governments.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the American ambassador at large for war crimes
issues, spent hours over the last two days interviewing refugees at
the vast camp developing in Blace, just south of the border with
Kosovo. He said he would be returning to the United States to
report to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rebel army, however, the United States has steered
clear of showing support for it as a military organization, and
during peace talks in France administration officials pushed the
rebels to transform themselves into a political movement.
</P>
<P>
   But as the possibility of NATO ground forces in Kosovo arises,
there is a growing sentiment among some Western observers here that
the guerrillas could, if assisted, do much of the difficult
fighting on the ground, harassing and inflicting damage on Serbian
supply convoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have enough training,'' one Western military observer in
Skopje, the Macedonian capital, said. ``All they need,'' the
official added, are Kalashnikovs and anti-tank grenade launchers.
``They know how to use them.''  &QL;

VOLATILE ISSUES AWAIT CHINA'S PREMIER IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Zhu Rongji, China's charismatic Prime Minister and
currently the driving force behind its ambitious economic changes,
arrives in the United States this week determined to fight the
downward spiral in U.S.-Chinese relations _ but without departing
from the Communist Party line.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old Zhu, widely admired in China for his frank talk
and impatience with incompetent officials, will have to confront
head-on the many political disputes that have come to a boil since
his trip was conceived in the afterglow of President Clinton's
visit to China last year. Human rights, accusations of Chinese
nuclear spying, the military balance with Taiwan and a widening
trade gap are all factors that have soured a skeptical Congress on
Washington's and Beijing's strategy of mutual engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, meanwhile, are outraged by the U.S.-led bombing of
Yugoslavia, which they regard as an illegal intervention in a
sovereign country with worrying implications for their own
determination to keep control of Tibet, whose indigenous
inhabitants, like Kosovo's Albanians, would probably prefer
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Top Chinese leaders seriously considered postponing the trip
until the bombing stops. But they decided to proceed, a sign of how
much China still values good relations with the United States,
considered vital to its own modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu departs Beijing on Tuesday for a day in Los Angeles before
continuing to Washington and then Denver, Chicago and New York,
finishing in Boston on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Although his agenda is weightier than he had expected, Zhu still
plans to spend a day discussing the environment with Vice President
Al Gore _ part of his original agenda of bolstering economic ties
with the United States and developing projects to fight China's
severe environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations for entry to the World Trade Organization have
stalled because China could not agree to open its markets as
broadly as the United States demanded _ meaning there will be no
major agreements to sign during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu is bound to run into U.S. criticism of China's human rights
record. Chinese and Western political analysts in Beijing are
unanimous that he cannot waver in defense of China's record, in
particular now that the United States has announced it will sponsor
a resolution condemning China's rights record at a United Nations
meeting in April in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Any departure from the Communist Party line would undermine the
prime minister's power, political analysts say. This is especially
true because unlike other top leaders, he has not developed a
powerful personal constituency within the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if any Chinese leader can carry off such a prickly trip,
it is Zhu. A former mayor of Shanghai, where he courted foreign
investors, Zhu knows the West and talks with a absence of Marxist
cant. His spectacular rise to power, after years as a political
outcast, seemed based on competence alone and he is respected in
China for his intellect and practical, serious style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart leader with great personal charisma, and is very
adept at using it to sell his messages,'' said Zhang Xiaojin, a
professor of international politics at People's University in
Beijing. ``This trip comes at a critical time, and what he does
could have an important impact on the long-term development of the
Chinese-American relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In his only public statements on the American visit, at a rare
news conference March 15, Zhu said, ``The goal of my visit is to
tell you the truth and also to let you vent your anger and voice
your complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also to resume the good momentum toward building a
constructive strategic partnership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly or wrongly, the Chinese feel terribly misunderstood in
the United States. In the view of many Chinese, Zhu and President
Jiang Zemin are bravely steering the country through a painful
transition toward a market-oriented economy. Those Chinese, unlike
the dissidents whose cause is important to many in the West, see
China as a country where the rule of law is expanding and people
have unprecedented freedom in their personal lives, if not in
politics. And Taiwan, people here note, is internationally
recognized as an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
   So why are Americans so stringent about China's entry to the
World Trade Organization? Why so much fuss about the arrest of some
disruptive radicals, and why the threat to create an open military
alliance with Taiwan? ``Zhu Rongji will try to get the American
people to understand the real situation in China,'' said Xiong
Zhiyong, dean of the Foreign Affairs College in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   However, Zhu and other Chinese leaders tend to underestimate the
depth of U.S. concerns over rights, trade and foreign policy, said
David Shambaugh, a China expert at George Washington University and
the Brookings Institution in Washington. Instead, they tend to
attribute criticism to a small cabal of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't understand that the broad masses see China through
suspicious eyes,'' Shambaugh said, adding that a host of U.S.
interest groups, from the religious right to labor to supporters of
the Dalai Lama, may all voice complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu is likely to be at his persuasive best when he discusses
economics, an area where he has broad knowledge and unusually
sweeping powers. Earlier in this decade, Zhu guided China out of
rampant inflation without stifling economic growth, an achievement
praised worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while China is gradually opening to foreign companies and
forcing its state firms to adapt to the market, Zhu is no Adam
Smith. He has been a Communist since 1949, his career largely in
central planning. His strategy of wringing out bloated state
enterprises is intended to save the state sector, not liquidate it.
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, Zhu can _ if he chooses _ assert a certain
authority to debating the issue because he was a victim of
persecution himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, as a rising official of the state planning commission,
Zhu was branded a ``rightist,'' pushed out of his job and allowed
only to work as a math teacher. Then, as Mao's Great Cultural
Revolution began in 1966, he was sent to the countryside in Hubei
province, where he worked on a farm and taught math. Zhu was able
to return to government work only in 1973, as Deng Xiaoping, an
economic reformer, began to regain power.
</P>
<P>
   But current leaders here make a distinction between the
``excesses'' of the Maoist past and their present demand for social
stability as they pursue economic changes whose consequences are
unpredictable. Their notion of stability means stamping out any
threats to the rule of the Communist Party, which leads them to
imprison advocates of democracy despite international criticism.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the briefing room at the State Department to
the corridors of Whitehall in London and NATO headquarters in
Brussels, a word usually avoided by policy-makers is being uttered
ever more frequently to describe events in Kosovo: genocide.
</P>
<P>
   It is not used merely to cudgel Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and to warn that he could be held culpable for atrocities
and to press him to stop. Nor is it used solely to place him in the
public mind squarely in the ranks of this century's tyrants and to
rally Americans and Europeans to defeat him.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers in the United States and Europe are invoking the
word to help provide a legal justification for their military
campaign against Serbia. It is one based in part on concepts of
humanitarian law, where no word is more evocative.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the public invocation of genocide _ something
political leaders had been distinctly reluctant to do during the
strife in Bosnia or Rwanda _ is itself helping to create a new
model of international law that may one day be used to justify
similar interventions in sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
   A broad spectrum of legal scholars agree that there is currently
no simple, straightforward or obvious legal basis for the bombing
of Serbian targets to be found in treaties, the United Nations'
charter or binding resolutions or any other written international
legal code.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional view of international law would clearly
prohibit what is happening,'' said Professor Abram Chayes, of the
Harvard Law School, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One feature of this approach is to bypass the United Nations,
whose charter is the fundamental legal document on international
peace and security. In fact, the Charter explicitly forbids
regional alliances like NATO from taking military action without
first seeking the Security Council's permission. U.S. policy-makers
did not seek such authorization, officials have acknowledged, in
part because Russia and China would be expected to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials said they did not set out to
create any new broad precedents for military intervention, they
have insisted that there is an adequate basis for their action.
</P>
<P>
   Col. P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security
Council, said, ``We believe there is legitimate and sufficient
legal grounds for the United States and NATO for the use of force
in this situation.'' He cited two recent United Nations resolutions
calling on Yugoslavia to take measures to end the suffering in
Kosovo. Those resolutions do not, however, contain any
authorization of the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that the
resolutions have been made to ``support rather than authorize'' the
use of force. The official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that there are several factors the United States
and its allies believe provide a legal foundation for the military
action.
</P>
<P>
   The ``humanitarian crisis unfolding'' is prominent among them,
the official said. In addition to accusations of genocide, the
official said, there are ``abhorrent crimes against humanity that
violate international law and that are every bit as serious as
genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Genocide is defined in a specific convention, which the United
States and Yugoslavia have both signed, that does not explicitly
provide for armed intervention as a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Yugoslav leaders have loudly asserted that the
bombing is a clear violation of international law, which
traditionally elevates the value of national sovereignty in most
situations.
</P>
<P>
   But Chayes, a former State Department legal adviser, said that
while there is little traditional justification for the current
bombing campaign, ``some people have argued for a humanitarian
exception allowing for the intervention with force to prevent
large-scale violations of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly is in many ways a new idea in terms of
international law and raises a lot of difficult questions,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   In the amorphous field of humanitarian law, ``There's a great
deal of debate about what the threshold for intervention should
be,'' said Diane Orentlicher, a human rights lawyer and law
professor at American University. ``But the treaty does provide a
bright line in saying that states should not stand idly by when
there is genocide but have a duty to put a stop to it. It is the
legal embodiment of the vow `never again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The administration official said that another important element
of the humanitarian factor is the legacy of the Nuremberg Tribunal
set up after World War II, which prohibits systematic abuses of
civilians, even by a state within its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Professor W. Michael Reisman, a professor of international law
at Yale University, said he believes that what is occurring in
Central Europe ``has produced a critical moment and a basic change
in international legal practice.'' Although he believes that
international law has been used to deal with humanitarian issues,
Professor Reisman said what is happening in Central Europe is of an
unprecedented scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have something that goes far beyond the usual notion of
using force for self-defense,'' he said. ``We have a massive use of
force against a government over inappropriate treatment of their
own nationals.'' It may also bring about the redrawing of a
sovereign state's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the cases in which military intervention has been
sanctioned for humanitarian reasons have applied to campaigns with
limited objectives. Professor Ruth Wedgwood of the Yale Law School
said the classic example is the Israeli raid at Entebbe, Uganda, in
1976 to rescue its citizens from terrorists who had hijacked their
airplane. ``The idea of humanitarian bombing is something much
heavier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Professor Wedgwood said she believes what is
happening may provide a model for the future. ``We are pushing the
envelope, being legally innovative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What underlies the discussion is a deeply held anxiety among
international legal authorities about how fully international law
is respected by political leaders. International law has
traditionally been derided as something to which policy-makers
claim fealty when it is to their advantage and ignore or interpret
very loosely when it is not on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Thomas Franck of the New York University Law School,
said he believes that the allies can justify their action by
arguing that even if they have violated the U.N. charter and
international law, it was necessary to counteract even greater
violations by the Belgrade government of laws that prohibit a
government from abusing its own citizens.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The two Interior Ministry buildings hit
by NATO cruise missiles overnight smoldered on Saturday in
Belgrade's morning haze, collapsed in on themselves at wacky
angles. They provided angry citizens with evidence of NATO's
astounding accuracy _ Yugoslav authorities said there were no
casualties of any kind _ and of the alliance's vow to strike
military and security headquarters, even in the heart of Serbia's
capital.
</P>

   ``These bombs will just increase the sense that the world is
against us and we must stick together,'' said Dragan, 28, a chemist
attending the daily rock concert of solidarity in the city's
Republic Square who gave only his first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting empty buildings will not affect this regime,'' he
said, brushing aside with a dismissive jerk of his head the idea
that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was in any danger.
``Forget that story. They can hit one building after another, but
then what do they do? That's the whole question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic has the best bunker in town,'' Dragan said. ``He'll
be the last Serb left alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings, both utterly destroyed by cruise-missile
strikes early Saturday morning, were the Yugoslav and Serbian
Ministries of the Interior, the headquarters for the police and the
special militarized police, who are most active in the fight
against the Kosovo Liberation Army and its ethnic Albanian civilian
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But officials who worked at low-level jobs in the buildings,
which had been well known as potential NATO targets, said Saturday
that both had been largely empty for more than a week. ``There
weren't even chairs,'' one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   But she could not say whether important equipment had remained
in the building or whether any underground communications centers
existed there.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said that pieces of the buildings flew 400 yards into
the air, and firefighters worked until nearly 6 a.m. to put out the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The police cordoned off the area, and the Yugoslav army press
center was unable to obtain permission to let journalists inside,
or even to interview doctors and patients at the large university
hospital center only a few hundred yards from the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television, which went on the air very early
Saturday morning with dramatic footage of the fires, immediately
rebroadcast worldwide by international networks, concentrated
Saturday on the anger of doctors, patients and staff members of the
maternity, gynecological and psychiatric wards.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian interior minister, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, compared the
bombing to the Nazi Easter bombing of Belgrade in 1941 and called
NATO ``neo-Nazis.'' The missile strikes were, he said, ``the acts
of a monster criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are united and determined to save our country, to save our
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, state-run news outlets reported that
Milosevic had met top Serbian leaders and issued a statement
afterward emphasizing ``that bombs cannot damage the heroic spirit
of Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is united in its determination to defend the
country from the aggressor,'' the statement said. ``Although the
aggressors bomb bridges, hospitals and civilian targets, the
institutions of the country function normally.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Praising the architecture of the two ministry buildings _
archetypal concrete-and-glass structures of the post-1945 communist
model _ Stojiljkovic said defiantly, ``Our children and
grandchildren will build even better buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief nurse of the maternity ward, Gordana Tasic, told state
television that about 70 newborn babies and their mothers were
safely evacuated to a basement shelter of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that it happened,'' she said. ``It's their
holiday today,'' she added, referring to the Western Easter, which
precedes the Serbs' Orthodox commemoration by a week. ``If they
believe in God, they should stop this. How are the babies guilty?
Let them at least leave the babies and the children alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital center had also taken precautions, a medical staff
member said privately.
</P>
<P>
   The central pharmacy had moved its stocks and computers to the
basement, and the maternity and psychiatric wards had sent all
ambulatory patients home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one died, but everyone is very upset and angry,'' the staff
member said, describing how one woman who had just had emergency
abdominal surgery had to walk down stairs to the basement shelter.
</P>
<P>
   At the daily rock rally, musicians of all political stripes sang
a new anthem about Serbian unity that has swept the city. It was
written by a well-known nationalist performer, Bora Djordjevic,
known as Corba, or stew, from his band, Fish Stew. The song uses a
famous chorus of the ``Four S's'': ``Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava'' _
``Only unity saves the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two verses translate: ``Now that they are bombing us, Serbs no
longer fight among themselves. For it is our slogan, that only
unity saves the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them come down to the ground,'' the song continues. ``Then
I will stop singing, look them in the eyes and fire without
hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is now completely unchallenged among Serbs, said Ivan,
25, who described himself as a ``former student'' who dislikes his
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stupid bombing makes Milosevic stronger every day,'' he
said. ``I believe that he must be America's player, because they
seem to make him stronger.''

PROGRAMS ABOUT SEX ABSTINENCE HAVE IMPACT NATIONWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., N.J., Calif., N.H., Utah, La., S.C., S.D., N.Y.,
Conn.)   (bl)  
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the uproar when Congress set aside $50 million a year
for states to create abstinence-education programs teaching the
benefits of delaying sex until marriage, every state in the nation
ultimately applied for the money when it became available in fiscal
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But two states withdrew from the first year of the program,
according to a new report to be released Monday by the Sexuality
Information and Education Council of the United States, a nonprofit
group, and there are enormous variations in what the other states
are doing with the federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Some have created classroom abstinence programs that, as the law
mandates, teach the harmful effects of sex outside marriage, while
others have spent the money on media campaigns encouraging parents
to talk to their children about sex, but never specifically linking
sex and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, the sky isn't falling, but the federal
abstinence-only program is beginning to change the landscape of
sexuality education,'' said Debra Haffner, the president of the
council, which advocates comprehensive sex education, including
contraceptive information. ``There were nearly 700 abstinence-only
grants nationwide, and five states have passed laws requiring that
sexuality education programs teach that delaying sex until marriage
is the expected standard for school-age children.''
</P>
<P>
   Most states, including New York and Connecticut, have split the
money between education programs, media campaigns and grants to
community organizations. But some states put all the money into one
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, for example, the money has gone to the
schools, with 117 school districts and 21 charter schools receiving
grants to teach that the expected standard of human sexual activity
is ``mutually faithful monogamous heterosexual relationships in the
context of marriage.'' North Carolina also adopted a law requiring
school sex-education programs to teach that standard.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, where Gov. Christie Whitman decided not to use
the abstinence money in schools because the federal requirements
conflicted with state law mandating comprehensive sexuality
education, all the money went to community organizations for a
range of mentoring, recreational and other programs that are not
specifically confined to sex education.
</P>
<P>
   In the District of Columbia, Maine, Wyoming and elsewhere, the
survey found, the abstinence money was used to help develop media
campaigns. The District of Columbia emphasized self-esteem, Wyoming
adopted a themes of ``Sex Can Wait,'' aimed at 10- to 14-year-olds,
and Maine used 30-second television spots with the tag line, ``Not
Me, Not Now.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, after heated debated among legislators about
whether programs stressing abstinence until marriage actually
prevented young people from engaging in sexual behavior, the
lawmakers refused to appropriate the required matching state funds,
so no federally financed abstinence programs could be started.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, too, ultimately withdrew its application for the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how states can, and should, use the money, which
they are required to match with $3 for every $4 received, remains a
polarizing issue. Many advocates of comprehensive sex education
still argue that a strict reading of the law interferes with
offering contraceptive information to sexually active young people.
Those who favor abstinence-only education complain that many states
are circumventing the law by using the money on things like
television commercials urging teens to delay sex until they are
ready, without ever mentioning marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things some states are doing seem to me to violate
the letter and the spirit of the law, `' said Peter Brandt,
director of the National Coalition for Abstinence Education in
Colorado Springs, a nonprofit group created to monitor how the
money is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're watering down the strong intent of the law,'' he said.
``Media campaigns can be very useful, but not these fuzzy
television messages we've seen in Kentucky or Massachusetts, about
not having sex until you're ready, where it's not tied to marriage
at all. It's not enough to tell a 15-year-old she should wait until
she's old enough and she's in a committed relationship. Every
15-year-old girl in America would say she's mature enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt also said that many states were ignoring the requirement
in the federal law that the program to be financed have as its
``exclusive purpose'' the teaching of the benefits of abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   ``While mentoring or recreation can be part of a program,'' he
said, ``I don't think sponsoring a hockey league, as they're doing
in Utah, meets that requirement. The exclusive-purpose requirement
has pretty much been torn up by a lot of states.''
</P>
<P>
   Nan Streeter, the manager of Utah's reproductive health program,
said Brandt misunderstood the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Murray Boys and Girls Club, the grantee that has the
hockey league, uses multiple mechanisms to promote abstinence among
the youth they serve,'' she said. ``They work on good
decision-making, self-esteem, resiliency and refusal skills. But we
also recognize that when kids are playing hockey, or basketball,
it's hard for them to get involved in risky behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the states that used at least part of the federal money on
media campaigns, the report found, only four used `'abstinence
only, until marriage'' as their key message, while the majority
used a general abstinence message, or emphasized the importance of
adults, like parents or teachers, talking with young people about
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haffner of the Sexuality Information and Education Council
agreed that states varied in how strictly they construed the law,
with some working to find creative ways to use the Federal money
without excluding either gays or young people who were already
sexually active and in need of contraceptive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states did exercise considerable latitude,'' she said. ``I
think they tried to use the money in a way that made sense to them.
For some, that meant public health campaigns generally promoting
abstinence to young people or encouraging parents to talk to their
children about these issues. For others, it meant following the
letter of the law exactly, teaching the harmful effects of anything
but abstinence until marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Three states, Louisiana, South Carolina and South Dakota,
declined to take part in the council's survey.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the survey found, 25 states used some of the federal
money for school programs, 23 used it for in-class instruction, and
most offered some after-school program as well. Junior high schools
were the most likely to have abstinence programs using the federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, the council's study found, the federal
abstinence money is handled by health departments, but in several,
the governor's office controls the program directly.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember the Powell Doctrine?
</P>
<P>
   That was the strict and cautious set of standards espoused by
Gen. Colin Powell when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
for determining where, when and how U.S. military force should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   It held that the United States should intervene militarily only
when the nation's vital interests were at stake, only with decisive
force and only when there was a clear goal and a defined strategy
for getting out.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, those tenets were discarded
as Vietnam-era relics that raised barriers to military intervention
too high to suit the realities of today's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point of having this superb military that you've
always been talking about if we can't use it?'' Madeleine Albright,
now secretary of state, demanded of Powell when she was the
country's United Nations ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   So the Clinton administration embraced Albright's ``Doability
Doctrine'' _ that the United States should use its military power
in more flexible ways to achieve practical, if limited, goals.
Successes in providing relief to Rwanda, mounting air strikes in
Bosnia and restoring some semblance of democracy in Haiti helped
bolster the new thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Nearly two weeks of NATO bombing has failed to stop
the Yugoslav army's brutal removal of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo,
and starkly revealed the limitations of an air-only campaign in
trying to break President Slobodan Milosevic's will to wage war.
The capture of three U.S. soldiers along the Macedonia border only
made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Powell's principles are looking a lot more attractive.
``This only affirms the Powell Doctrine,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., who joined the growing chorus of those clamoring to send
ground troops into Kosovo. ``This is more reminiscent of the
gradual escalation and bombing pauses that characterized the
Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Powell broke his usually self-imposed silence on continuing
military operations last week, offering remarks that carried a
distinctly I-told-you-so ring. ``The challenge of just using air
power is that you leave it in the hands of your adversary to decide
when he's been punished enough,'' Powell told reporters before a
speech in Blacksburg, Va. ``So the initiative will remain with
President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Powell principles served to neatly reconcile two strains of
U.S. foreign policy that have influenced U.S. administrations for
decades. One is never again to appease a tyrant who threatens vital
interests, as British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did with
Hitler in Munich. With this goal painfully in mind, Clinton has
always regretted that the United States failed to address the
Bosnia problem sooner than it did.
</P>
<P>
   The second foreign policy strain weighing heavily on Clinton,
and at the heart of Powell's doctrine, is the conviction that U.S.
military forces should never again become bogged down in a quagmire
like Vietnam. A clear exit strategy now is supposed to be a
prerequisite for mounting a military operation.
</P>
<P>
   Powell believed that the military should be used only when the
country's vital interests were at stake and, when it was, used to
win and win quickly. Yet Albright has not been alone in championing
her vision of using military force as a more flexible instrument of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993, Powell's hand-picked successor, Gen. John
Shalikashvili, almost immediately began to distance himself from
his mentor's doctrine. Shalikashvili broadened it to include
important interests that affected the nation's well-being, if not
its very survival, along with humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powell was good for a period of time,'' said Gen. George
Joulwan, a retired commander of U.S. forces in Latin America and
Europe, who supervised the Rwanda relief operation. ``But we must
be able to adapt to the new challenges we face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joulwan cautioned that there are still Powell principles
worth remembering, like maintaining a clear political and military
objective. ``Sometimes the State Department likes to have fuzziness
in all this, but when you commit forces, you have to have
objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security
adviser, agreed. ``You have to tailor the use of force to the
objectives you're trying to achieve,'' he said. ``But you've got to
know what you're trying to do. You've got to look at all the
alternatives, and not just say, `We'll do this and hope it works.'
What if it doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   And here is where, critics say, the Clinton administration
blundered in Kosovo. While the objectives may have been clear _ to
stop Serb brutality, expel Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and force
Milosevic to the peace table _ the execution was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, NATO drew up plans that could have satisfied the
demands of the Powell Doctrine, calling for as many as 200,000
allied troops to occupy Yugoslavia _ about 75,000 for Kosovo alone
_ if Belgrade refused to negotiate. Administration officials
gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would oppose NATO ground troops, administration
officials said. And few in Washington predicted that the 19-member
alliance would remain united behind a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem was that no one on Capitol Hill had signed on
to that,'' said an administration official deeply involved in the
planning for Kosovo. ``This administration was operating on the
assumption ground troops would raise this to a new level, and we
hadn't prepared public for that or gotten the allies on board.''
</P>
<P>
   So President Clinton and NATO turned to the air campaign, even
though U.S. intelligence analysts and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
warned them that an aerial bombardment wouldn't work, and might
even hasten the Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told lawmakers in private meetings that air power had
driven Milosevic to the Bosnia peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, in
1995. But in fact, the air campaign was successful because a joint
offensive by Bosnian Muslim and Croatian forces changed the
equation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying we won't send in ground troops may be good for American
domestic political consumption, but it tells Milosevic there's a
limit to our commitment,'' said Maj. Gen. William Nash, a retired
commander of U.S. troops in Bosnia. ``He calculates there's no
reason for him to give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the air campaign has been politically shackled. Explicit in
the Powell Doctrine's notion of overwhelming force were the goals
of winning quickly while keeping casualties low and maintaining
public support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Balkans, the goals haven't meshed well. When fog and
rain set in, NATO commanders called off bombing runs because they
didn't want pilots to have to fly under the clouds and face a
greater risk of ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And even as U.S. political leaders fear for their pilots in the
sky, they also fear civilian casualties on the ground. So NATO
hesitated last week before attacking government ministries in
Belgrade, targets dear to Milosevic's hold on power. Such
hesitation offers him another reason to hold firm.

   ``Saying we won't send in ground troops may be good for American
domestic political consumption, but it tells Milosevic there's a
limit to our commitment,'' said Maj. Gen. William Nash, a retired
commander of U.S. troops in Bosnia. ``He calculates there's no
reason for him to give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the air campaign has been politically shackled. Explicit in
the Powell Doctrine's notion of overwhelming force were the goals
of winning quickly while keeping casualties low and maintaining
public support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the Balkans, the goals haven't meshed well. When fog and
rain set in, NATO commanders called off bombing runs because they
didn't want pilots to have to fly under the clouds and face a
greater risk of ground-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And even as U.S. political leaders fear for their pilots in the
sky, they also fear civilian casualties on the ground. So NATO
hesitated last week before attacking government ministries in
Belgrade, targets dear to Milosevic's hold on power. Such
hesitation offers him another reason to hold firm.

<P>
   The warnings from Washington were clear. Spy satellites and high
technology eavesdropping equipment will be monitoring your forces
in Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was told last
week. Any evidence of atrocities carried out by Serbian soldiers
will be forwarded to the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is extremely alarmed by reports of an
escalating pattern of Serbian attacks on Kosovar Albanian
civilians,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
``We are using our national technical means to observe events in
Kosovo and are prepared to share that information.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech saber rattling was meant to conjure up certain
images in the Serbian leader's mind: stark aerial photographs of
swaths of freshly turned earth near Srebrenica, Bosnia, in 1995. In
a dramatic presentation to the United Nations Security Council,
Madeleine Albright, who was then the chief U.S. delegate to the
United Nations, unveiled detailed overhead photographs of what
appeared to be mass graves near Srebrenica, which had recently
fallen to Bosnian Serb forces despite its status as an area that
the United Nations had declared a safe haven for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 Muslim men are believed to have been killed by the
Bosnian Serbs after Srebrenica fell, and war crimes investigators
later exhumed the graves and found the bodies of dozens. If such
savagery occurs in Kosovo, Milosevic was implicitly warned, it too
will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic may not be so frightened by such threats. Three
and a half years later, Srebrenica stands as an example not of the
power of U.S. technology but of its limits; even more clearly, it
also stands as an example of how any technology can be rendered
superfluous in the absence of political will.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. satellites and spy planes indeed captured images of a dozen
suspected mass graves around Srebrenica in the summer and fall of
1995. But war crimes investigators who entered Bosnia the following
spring to exhume the graves after the signing of the Dayton, Ohio,
peace accords were troubled by their findings. Several of the
graves appeared to have been exhumed already _ by the Bosnian
Serbs. Hundreds of bodies were missing.
</P>
<P>
   A t the time, U.S. officials, who had promised that the graves
would be monitored by spy planes and satellites, said they had no
images of Bosnian Serbs removing bodies. Several explanations were
possible. Perhaps U.S. spy planes and satellites had not been
monitoring the graves as promised. Perhaps the satellites had
failed to capture the Bosnian Serb exhumations because they either
passed overhead at the wrong time or could not see through clouds.
Or perhaps the Americans had the images but, for whatever reason,
would not give them to tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   So the hunt for bodies continues around Srebrenica two years
later. Only about 1,500 of the presumed 7,000 have been recovered.
Breakthroughs last spring came from low-technology sources. A
Bosnian Serb reported seeing suspicious activity in one area where
graves were later found, and a NATO work crew widening a road dug
up what turned out to be a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   But looming far larger than the shortcomings in finding
Srebrenica's victims has been a lack of will to arrest the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Bosnian Serb troops who carried out the
executions, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic have both been indicted for command responsibility at
Srebrenica, but neither has been arrested and Mladic has reportedly
lived safely in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   While peacekeeping forces in Bosnia have arrested some low-level
officials, U.S. and European fears of heavy casualties have halted
attempts to arrest top leaders. And the international war crimes
tribunal itself has at times been slow to press the Americans for
intelligence, mount investigations of war crimes in Kosovo or
investigate Milosevic himself.
</P>
<P>
   Given that record, Milosevic seems unlikely to tremble at the
threat posed to him by U.S. surveillance equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The spy technology also appears, in one sense, to be a
double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a coalition of groups demanding stronger U.S.
action in Kosovo called on the Clinton administration to release
all aerial reconnaissance photos documenting human rights
violations in Kosovo. Now that the administration has used spy
photos to expose one atrocity, it is expected to capture evidence
of another and release it.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Basseuner, associate director of the Balkan Action Council,
accused the administration of trying to use vows of high-technology
monitoring as a substitute for bold action. ``I get the feeling
that they're saying that,'' he said, referring to the monitoring,
``as a filler to get around the fact that they're not fighting this
war with the drive that they should.''

<P>
   With the shooting death of an unarmed African immigrant by four
police officers, New York City has grimly discovered there is a
price for the tough law enforcement tactics that have led to its
steep drop in crime: estrangement between police and citizens,
something that many cities successfully combating crime have
managed to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   This estrangement erupted in weeks of protests since Amadou
Diallo, a street vendor from Guinea, was shot 19 times at his Bronx
home Feb. 4, and has also given rise to widespread complaints that
police officers mistreat residents of minority neighborhoods. A
question many law enforcement officials around the country are
asking is how much of this was self-inflicted after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir abandoned efforts by
their predecessors to establish community policing, scorning it as
social work.
</P>
<P>
   But community policing, which makes citizens allies of the
police, is thriving in many cities, from Chicago to San Diego and
from Fort Wayne, Ind., to Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Based on statistics alone, several of these cities have
surpassed New York City in reducing crime. Where homicides in New
York City have dropped by two-thirds from a record high in 1990, in
San Diego they have dropped by three-fourths from their peak in
1991. Where New York City has seen a 41 percent decline in overall
violent crime in the past decade, Fort Worth has recorded a 56
percent drop, according to a new study by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   These cities have achieved their gains without the
confrontations seen in New York City. Jerry Sanders, the police
chief of San Diego, which has a population of 1.2 million, measures
progress as much by an annual survey of public satisfaction with
the police as by the actual reduction in the crime rate. The most
recent survey, conducted by an outside consultant, showed approval
at 89 percent, he said. In a New York Times poll conducted March 8
through 14, 43 percent of New Yorkers thought the police were doing
an excellent or good job.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Wayne, a city of 200,000, neighborhood leaders help
evaluate prospective police candidates and sit in on
computer-generated crime statistics sessions similar to those in
New York City in which local police commanders are held accountable
for crime reduction in their districts. ``When you isolate yourself
and don't let people know what you are doing, they become
suspicious,'' said Nancy Becher, Fort Wayne's deputy police chief.
``We learned long ago that we can't do it all ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether police officers can do it all by themselves is at the
center of the debate between New York City's approach _ which
relies on the massive use of officers to suppress crime _ and the
strategy of community policing and a related approach called
problem-solving policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic premise is, we don't have enough police officers to
do it all, so we need community participation,'' said Sanders. San
Diego has only 1.7 officers per 1,000 residents, compared with 5
per 1,000 in New York City. The reliance on community participation
has another benefit, Sanders said: It avoids ``the long-term perils
of zero tolerance,'' Giuliani's policy of arresting minor
lawbreakers like jaywalkers, graffiti artists and others as a way
to avert more serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego has, of course, far fewer people than New York City,
but unlike New York City, it borders Mexico, which is a major
corridor for drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Its community
policing begins with a practical consideration: ``listening to the
community,'' Sanders says, ``and letting them tell us what their
priorities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the ideas of residents themselves, the police divided
the city into 99 neighborhoods, with a police team assigned to
each. These areas are on the department's Web site, and anyone can
look up a specific neighborhood and see what the police are doing
about crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things people wanted us to work on,'' Sanders said, ``were
not serious crimes, but mostly abandoned cars, or abandoned houses,
that attracted other problems to the neighborhoods, and in some of
the worst areas, drug houses.'' Once residents came to know their
officers and met regularly with them, they began providing a
constant flow of tips.
</P>
<P>
   Another component in community policing is 1,200 volunteers,
many of them retired people who receive police training, wear
police-like uniforms and drive around in official vehicles. They
help watch their neighborhood or work on police department
computers so officers can patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Problem-solving is also emphasized instead of simply making
arrests. This style of policing analyzes why certain locations
attract more crime or why particular people are repeatedly
victimized.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Agnes Brookes, a 69-year-old civilian volunteer,
was assigned to figure out why a self-storage warehouse had been
burglarized 150 times in six months. After studying other
warehouses, she decided the problem lay with a sloppy manager, who
was removed, and then she had the owner install better lighting,
fencing and an electronic lock. The burglaries stopped.

</P>
<P>
   Community policing began in the aftermath of the urban riots of
the late 1960s when the Kerner Commission, appointed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that part of the problem lay with the
failure of the police to involve local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Goldstein, a professor emeritus at the University of
Wisconsin Law School who is regarded as the originator of
problem-solving policing, said the first step was ``to get the
police to recognize that they cannot combat crime by themselves.''
The next step, he said, was ``to get people to like us, and then to
have the community help set police policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s Mayor David Dinkins and Police Commissioner
Lee Brown inaugurated some early and successful experiments with
community policing, including the removal of abandoned cars.
</P>
<P>
   But after defeating Dinkins, Giuliani and his first police
commissioner, William Bratton, eliminated community policing and
invested heavily in police operations. ``This was almost coming
full cycle back to the 1960s, to the idea that the police alone can
fight crime,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy is implicit in the macho motto of the Street
Crime Unit, whose members included the four officers indicted last
week in Diallo's death: ``We own the street,'' members boast.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Safir scoffed at community policing. ``If you
think back to 1990, '91, the total focus of this department was
community policing, and we had the highest crime rate in the
history of the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bullied by the community activists who say
we want feel-good cops,'' Safir said in another interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne has tried to carry community policing a step further
than San Diego, Ms. Becher said, moving toward a concept of
community government. The city is divided into 227 neighborhoods,
each with an assigned police officer who has the authority to call
on city agencies like the parks department or the housing code
department to deal with problems like loud music or abandoned
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also created a higher-level body where neighborhood
representatives can meet with senior police and city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne's homicides have been cut in half since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that New York has achieved stunning reductions
in crime. But Rana Sampson, a former police sergeant in the city,
who is director of public safety for the University of San Diego,
said: ``What NYPD did was throw people at the problems. You can't
put a cop on every corner, and do you really want to live in a
society with a cop on every corner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping peace by peaceful means'' was the credo of Sir Robert
Peel, who created the first modern police department in London in
the 1820s. ``The degree,'' he said, ``of cooperation of the public
that can be secured diminishes, proportionately, the necessity for
the use of physical force.''

 UNDATED: burglaries stopped.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Community policing began in the aftermath of the urban riots of
the late 1960s when the Kerner Commission, appointed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson, concluded that part of the problem lay with the
failure of the police to involve local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Goldstein, a professor emeritus at the University of
Wisconsin Law School who is regarded as the originator of
problem-solving policing, said the first step was ``to get the
police to recognize that they cannot combat crime by themselves.''
The next step, he said, was ``to get people to like us, and then to
have the community help set police policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s Mayor David Dinkins and Police Commissioner
Lee Brown inaugurated some early and successful experiments with
community policing, including the removal of abandoned cars.
</P>
<P>
   But after defeating Dinkins, Giuliani and his first police
commissioner, William Bratton, eliminated community policing and
invested heavily in police operations. ``This was almost coming
full cycle back to the 1960s, to the idea that the police alone can
fight crime,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy is implicit in the macho motto of the Street
Crime Unit, whose members included the four officers indicted last
week in Diallo's death: ``We own the street,'' members boast.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Safir scoffed at community policing. ``If you
think back to 1990, '91, the total focus of this department was
community policing, and we had the highest crime rate in the
history of the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be bullied by the community activists who say
we want feel-good cops,'' Safir said in another interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne has tried to carry community policing a step further
than San Diego, Ms. Becher said, moving toward a concept of
community government. The city is divided into 227 neighborhoods,
each with an assigned police officer who has the authority to call
on city agencies like the parks department or the housing code
department to deal with problems like loud music or abandoned
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also created a higher-level body where neighborhood
representatives can meet with senior police and city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Wayne's homicides have been cut in half since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that New York has achieved stunning reductions
in crime. But Rana Sampson, a former police sergeant in the city,
who is director of public safety for the University of San Diego,
said: ``What NYPD did was throw people at the problems. You can't
put a cop on every corner, and do you really want to live in a
society with a cop on every corner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping peace by peaceful means'' was the credo of Sir Robert
Peel, who created the first modern police department in London in
the 1820s. ``The degree,'' he said, ``of cooperation of the public
that can be secured diminishes, proportionately, the necessity for
the use of physical force.''

MILOSEVIC IS PLAYING TO TWO AUDIENCES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Clinton may seem tired and worn
these days, but President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is
looking on top of his little world.
</P>
<P>
   With no contentious U.S. electorate or media to distract him,
Milosevic is riding above the fray, while his army and his police
are capturing (or abducting) American soldiers, shooting down a
stealth airplane and expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo in
numbers beyond any Washington policy-maker's most embarrassing
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the confusing structure of the federal Information
Ministry, the Serbian Information Ministry, the military press
center and Serbian state television, there is a clear understanding
that Milosevic is playing now to two audiences: domestic and
international, especially American.
</P>
<P>
   While his voice is rarely heard, even on state television, film
of his beaming, seemingly genial chat sessions are being broadcast
repetitively around the world, in part because the news channels
can get so little footage of their own past the Serbian censors.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO is pounding his country _ including, now, his capital
_ from the air, Milosevic, portly and smiling, is meeting Vatican
envoys, Russian delegations and a moderate ethnic Albanian leader
and talking of peace. His military seems to be withstanding NATO's
might, and his people, who don't especially like him, are rallying
around him anyway, as the commander in chief of an embattled
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fifth column in Serbia now,'' said Vuk Draskovic,
the former anti-Milosevic democracy campaigner who was co-opted
into the government before the war began. ``We're all one party
now. We're all under one banner, the Yugoslav banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Zorana Ilic, a 32-year-old pharmacist interviewed on Saturday in
the crowded downtown streets, said the destruction of the Interior
Ministry buildings overnight would have little effect on the regime
or on ordinary Serbs, who are simply being driven closer together _
here and in the diaspora abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just now, there are 13 million people who are at the same time
against him and for him,'' she said. ``He will be even stronger now
than before it started. I don't know why American analysts even get
a salary.''
</P>
<P>
   People are afraid, of course, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to die, even from a fine, democratic American
bomb,'' she said. ``But people conquer their fear by standing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejan Anastasijevic, an analyst for Vreme magazine, said the
Belgrade strikes were symbolic, meant to show Milosevic that the
alliance could hit any target.
</P>
<P>
   ``But NATO took a great risk of civilian casualties, with a
hospital so nearby, just to demonstrate that it can destroy two
totally empty office buildings,'' he said. ``This has not damaged
Milosevic's standing or his capacity to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Milosevic met with other senior officials and
issued a statement afterward praising ``the heroic spirit of
Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Another typically controlled triumph was his televised meeting
on Thursday with Ibrahim Rugova, the moderate, pacifist ethnic
Albanian leader. The meeting shocked Washington, coming on the same
day that the three U.S. soldiers were captured along the Macedonian
border. Rugova had signed the Western-drafted peace settlement
rejected by the Serbs and had been overshadowed by the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   He had reportedly sought the protection of the Serbian police in
Pristina's chaos. But suddenly he was sitting happily with
Milosevic in equal armchairs opposing NATO bombing and vowing to
pursue a political solution. For whatever reason, and perhaps under
duress, Rugova appeared to be breaking ranks as the rebels and
their supporters were being swept from Kosovo, an extraordinary
public relations coup for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of neither man could be heard on television, and
requests to interview Rugova afterward went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there any way to evaluate Milosevic's tactics, which
Western diplomats fear will include an internal agreement with
Rugova on political autonomy for Kosovo and an invitation for
refugees to return, but with no peacekeeping or verification role
for NATO or any international organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the first NATO bombs in Belgrade, state
television concentrated on comparisons to the Nazi bombing of
Belgrade, also at Easter, in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spending too much time praising the Interior
Ministry and the activities of its troops and police _ no one's
favorite authorities _ television emphasized the evacuation of
wards in the nearby hospital, with its frightened mothers, angry
staff members, and newborn babies lying in rows in a basement
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Television has also reveled in the embarrassment of Clinton at
the capture of three U.S. soldiers, who the Yugoslavs insist had
crossed the border into Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A military court has begun an investigation into their case,
collecting evidence to see if they should be brought to trial. But
there has been no response to Clinton's demands that they be
released, and no indication of where they are being held. The
supposition here is that Milosevic will not hurry either to try or
to release them, but there was little information about them in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, too, Milosevic benefits enormously from
Yugoslavia's own wartime censorship, which has also allowed the
government to accelerate its war against independent media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The independent radio station B-92, which had its transmitter
disabled just before the bombs fell but which was broadcasting on
satellite and the Internet, was silenced early Friday through a
legal maneuver that put the station under government control.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, a number of other independent newspapers and
radio stations were closed throughout Kosovo, and Radio 021 in Novi
Sad, the northern Serbian city some 250 miles from Kosovo where
NATO attacks destroyed one of two bridges across the Danube.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry officials have excoriated NATO for destroying
the bridge, which they called a purely civilian target. Rade
Drobac, a senior Foreign Ministry official, asked in an interview,
``How does destroying a bridge and the city's water supply help the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo?''
</P>
<P>
   He said the bridge was a famous landmark, for in 1941, thousands
of Serbs and Jews were murdered on it and thrown into the river. He
said there was also damage to a 16th-century Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Drobac said that the Milosevic-Rugova meeting ``demonstrates
that at least one part of the Albanian leaders understands that
what NATO is doing is a misuse of them for NATO's goals.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Kosovo Liberation Army was almost completely
destroyed, ``so there are no more terrorists for the United States
to support with its bombing.'' Why not stop the bombs, Drobac
asked, ``to allow others, normal citizens, to return home in
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Serbia would keep all of Kosovo. ``I assure
you,'' he said, ``that no Serb can accept the partition of his
state.''
</P>
<P>
   A young Serb named Zoran, no fan of Milosevic, said he
nonetheless admired his president's tactical acuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all his faults, Milosevic is a hero now,'' he said. ``The
Serbs are proud of fighting for Kosovo, which is ours. We are
fighting the greatest power in the world, and even losing proudly
is a victory. Just standing up to such power is a victory.''

 &HT;    `Easter morning service put into pictures'
 &HT;    By Kim Grizzard

<TEXT>
<P>
   FARM LIFE, N.C. _ This land never was much good for corn.
</P>
<P>
   It just wouldn't grow there. Stephen Manning didn't know if
anything would until that cool spring night his daughter started
carrying quilts out the door of his family's Martin County
farmhouse. They were for the crowds that had gathered on the front
lawn to watch a passion play put on by a country church.
</P>
<P>
   The ground was cold, and there was nowhere else to sit.
</P>
<P>
   By the next spring, Manning and his fellow members at Piney
Grove Baptist Church had pushed up some dirt and put up bleachers.
The corn field had become a mission field, where the church would
tell the story of Jesus to anyone who could figure out how to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say the land was no good for raising corn, so we'd
see if we could raise some Christians on it,'' Manning's widow,
Nancy, recalled. ``They're still using our little corn field.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the little corn field has seating for more
than 2,000, along with computerized lighting and sound systems.
Parking attendants direct traffic generated by hundreds of cars and
a dozen or more tour buses that arrive on any given night for ``The
Message of Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see those people coming across the field, it's
overwhelming to think these people have driven hundreds of miles
and come out here in the middle of nowhere,'' said Jimmy Griffin,
who has played Jesus all 20 years of the production. ``People
coming in the Trailways buses, the church buses, the vans _ people
I've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   They come from Raleigh, Rocky Mount, Winston-Salem and parts of
Virginia to see a play with no advertising budget and an
all-amateur cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have old farmers who you would not think would do this _
get up there and act,'' said Manning, who plays Mary, the mother of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who does the high priest, he used to be a parts
salesman. He's retired now; he's a dog catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just ordinary people, being used in an extraordinary
way. We don't have any special talent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning
</P>
<P>
   There were no tour buses that first year. It was mostly folks
from neighboring churches who turned out to watch the cast _
wearing costumes sewn from old bedspreads and curtains _ walk
through scenes while a narrator read from a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a thrown-together set,'' Griffin said. ``The rock
was made out of papier-mache. If it got wet, it would start
sagging, so we had to take it in every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, there were casting conflicts. Director and
playright E.T. Taylor had to cast himself as the ringleader of
sorts in the angry mob that demanded that Jesus be put to death.
None of the other church members would agree to take on the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to get people to yell, `You're a liar!'
or `Crucify him!' anything derogatory to Christ,'' Taylor recalled.
``You're taking Christian people and asking them to do something
that is totally against what they would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult job. But slowly people were able to.
We have had people who have been in it all 20 years that to this
day will not say, `Crucify him!'''
</P>
<P>
   While others have volunteered for parts, church members are cast
in every role, a difficult task considering that about 250 people
attend the church and more than 150 are involved in the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of one family that's not involved,'' said Todd
Moore, who is in his first year as pastor at Piney Grove. Those who
are not in the cast help out with scenery, costumes and parking
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much takes our membership,'' said Robert Perry, who
portrays one of the disciples. ``When a kid can walk, he's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Church members do not age out from the drama as they grow older,
although the number of steps leading to the Upper Room has forced
some ``disciples'' into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Danny Griffin has had to climb the three flights
of steps that lead to the control tower. This season will be his
last as technical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years is a long time,'' he said. ``There's no way you
can do something for 20 years and not miss it, but it's time to
bring in some new blood, some new ideas, some new energy for a new
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In two decades, Danny Griffin has perhaps seen the most change
of anyone involved with the drama. He has seen the production
through the transformation from reel-to-reel tape to computerized
sound. He once had an amplifier blow out in the middle of the
drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to send the preacher out on the field and shout it out
as best he could,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing sometimes when we look at it. When I realize
where it's come from, it's been an amazing transformation how the
whole thing comes together. Certainly we realize that the Lord's
hand is in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed connections
</P>
<P>
   What else, members insist, could explain the way the church has
managed to support the drama without ever charging for admission?
There are no parking fees, no popcorn or programs to buy. There are
no pledge envelopes or donation boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we need has come almost like miracles to us,''
Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can tell you stories about the man who came to us and
wanted to build us a road. The road that we came in on was just a
sandy path, and he was a road builder. He brought in rock and built
us a rock road all the way up to the set. We didn't ask him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens all the time. The state puts up road signs for us
on Highway 17. We've just had a lot of `blessed connections,' we
call them.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophesy
</P>
<P>
   Whatever they call them, members of the Farm Life community
don't call these things coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in coincidence,'' said local naturalist and
author Gail Roberson, whose great-great grandfather preached at
Piney Grove even before there was a church. Roberson, who has
written extensively about the play, believes a passage in the Rev.
Bytha Leggett's faded journal foretells the success of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are a special breed of people,'' the journal entry
reads. ``I sense that in the future will open a door to them, and
that through this door will walk many. It is my belief that someday
this church will put forth new seed that will ... witness to hordes
of people that will come forth to them. These people are likely to
push up a new ground and sow forth new crops. They will succeed
where others will not. How much a part of this I wish I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson shared the passage with the church in 1985, the sixth
season of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read the quote many times, but it had been many years,''
she recalled. ``But when I was out there that night, something took
a hold of me. It was as if suddenly my mind was remembering that
line.''
</P>
<P>
   When she returned home that night, Roberson took out the journal
and looked for the passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had earmarked that page,'' she said. ``It just shows me that
it was supposed to be. It blows your mind the more you realize
about it. It makes the hair stand up on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest story
</P>
<P>
   Taylor knows this story about the drama, but he pays little
attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that was a prediction come true or not, I don't
know,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater story, he said, is the one told by the drama, which
is based on the four Gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the greatest story that's ever been told,'' Taylor said.
``This is not entertainment. It never was intended to be
entertainment. That's not the purpose in it. This is the Easter
morning service put into pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the drama, the audience was made up of
people who recognized those pictures, fellow Christians who already
knew the Easter story. Over the years, the church has aimed its
drama ministry at different groups. Now one night's performance is
done in Spanish, and another is for the hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started it, our crowds were churched people,''
said cast member Perry. ``We were `preaching to the choir.' Now
we're preaching to people who are probably unchurched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, I quit seeing people coming. I started seeing souls
coming. That sort of makes it different.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching lives
</P>
<P>
   The church receives cards and letters from people who say the
drama has touched their lives _ even changed them.
</P>
<P>
   Messages posted on the drama's Web site testify what the drama
has meant to the people who have seen it.
</P>
<P>
   One is from Tracey Gray of Chocowinity, who first saw the drama
when she was in high school. She remembers coming down the path to
the outdoor theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that went through my mind,'' Gray recalled, `I
looked at my mama and said, `This ain't going to be worth watching.
It can't be. It's out in the woods.'''
</P>
<P>
   She's been nearly every year since. Her mother died a few years
ago; now Tracey takes her own child to see the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to see this drama has almost become a part of our Easter
tradition,'' she said. ``To me, Easter's not here until you see
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like these people are doing this from their hearts. You
can tell when something is genuine. I honestly feel like God is
behind this because they could not have kept this going for 20
years it he wasn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   20 years
</P>
<P>
   The church never planned on more than four performances. The
first year, they gave six. Today, there are a dozen performances a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not in our wildest dreams did we think it would last
this long,'' Perry said. ``It became very apparent over the years
that it was something the Lord handed to us. We certainly couldn't
do this on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the ministry that crew our of a corn field is
dumbfounding to cast members, who say they can't understand it, let
alone take credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply do not understand why it touches people,'' Manning
said. ``Why plain people can do something and it touches people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how all that happened. We just sit back in
awe and watch them come in.''

 &HT;    A death in the family
 &HT;    By Janet Jacobs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOGAN, Texas _ As a family, they shared their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side in the dark-paneled sanctuary of the Full Gospel
Church, the people of Logan stood with their hands outstretched,
rocking and calling for God's comfort after two members of their
community had been slain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mourners were husband and wife, Gary and Peggy
Matthews. Each of them had lost a brother _ one who was killed, the
other accused of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   But no divisions were apparent because most of the people in
this community are related.
</P>
<P>
   Leading both funerals in October was the Rev. Corwin Barnett,
uncle of the accused, and a childhood friend of one of the victims.
Suppressing his own emotions, Barnett called for healing in the
tightknit community.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said they couldn't believe the love shown in each
service,'' Barnett said, remembering that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sweet spirit that was there.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest
</P>
<P>
   Logan's 300 or so residents live in clusters of modest homes and
trailers separated by miles of one-lane roads winding through
stands of tall pine in southern Panola County.
</P>
<P>
   Too small to have its own police force, Logan depends on Panola
County Sheriff Jack Ellett, a tall rangy man with a tanned and
deeply-lined face. Six months after the alleged crime, the normally
reticent Ellett shrugs and explains what most of the people in
Logan already know: the details of how Paul Cobble and Farrell
Rutherford were shot and why Roger Matthews was charged with
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ellett said the police radio he keeps in his house suddenly came
alive on the night of Oct. 24 with a confusion of voices summoning
deputies, ambulances and a justice of the peace to pronounce
someone dead.
</P>
<P>
   The first call was from D.W. Matthews, father of Roger Matthews,
47.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the scene, Ellett flips through files containing
witnesses' statements and deputies' reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Matthews was initially at his father's residence, where
they were having a wienie roast in back of the house,'' Ellett
explained. ``He'd left there earlier, and he'd gone to his friend
Farrell Rutherford's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies later found Rutherford, 66, shot through the chest,
sitting in the shed next to his trailer home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Roger returned to his father's house, he had a rifle with
him, and he demanded his father's car,'' Ellett said.
</P>
<P>
   D.W. Matthews told the officers his son threatened him with the
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ```He put the gun to my chest and demanded my keys,''' Ellett
quoted, reading from reports. ``He said, `I'm going to kill Mart
and Andy Gibbs.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 years earlier, Roger's youngest brother, Ronnie,
had been killed in a fight with the Gibbs brothers. It was ruled
self-defense, Ellett said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of going to the Gibbs' home, the sheriff said
Matthews headed for the home of Paul Cobble, 35. Cobble was
Matthews' best friend and the brother of his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The second call for help came from Tammy Cobble, Paul's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told the officers that Roger had killed her husband,''
Ellett said. ``We knew who we were looking for even before we knew
we had another victim at the Rutherford residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies Greg Ilmedia and Kenneth Edgmon began looking for Roger
and found him less than two miles away, sitting in the car at his
father's house, Ellett said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 light blue Buick sat facing the road with the
headlights on and the engine running. Through the glare of the
headlights, Roger Matthews' 6-foot, 250-pound frame could be seen
sitting behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies cautiously approached, guns drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got out and left the rifle in the front seat,'' Ellett
said. ``Roger put his hands in the air and said `I was waiting for
y'all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Roger Matthews told officers he didn't remember what took
place that night, Ellett said. Family members said he cried when he
was told why he was in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a Panola County grand jury charged Roger Matthews
with two counts of capital murder and one count of aggravated
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Matthews was determined sane and fit to stand
trial, said Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   A trial could be scheduled as soon as June, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Family ties
</P>
<P>
   The slayings are especially disturbing to the people of Logan
because Matthews is accused of killing two men who were both
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some way down the line, 90 percent of the people in this part
of the country are kin to each other,'' said Ricky Nunley, whose
house sits less than 200 yards from the trailer where Farrell
Rutherford was shot. He is also a distant cousin of Rutherford's.
</P>
<P>
   The men in Logan consider Roger Matthews ``a good old boy.'' He
is described as ``an excellent chess player,'' ``a man's man'' and
``someone who would do anything for you _ if he wasn't drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews occasionally worked on construction sites or fixing
cars, but he seldom held a job for more than a few days. He
preferred to work a little and hang around a lot, family members
said, not unkindly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was sober, you couldn't ask for a better friend,''
said Jerrold Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of them were friends of mine,'' he said, referring
to the victims and the accused. Price said he is distantly related
to Rutherford and Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Price looked up from the tractor wheel he was greasing, his eyes
searching for the trailer home where Rutherford died. ``People are
just hurt. It hurt me. It hurt to know a friend would do another
friend like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He, like others in the community, felt Matthews was a
predictable danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't afraid of him, but he'd hurt you,'' Price said.
``When he'd get drunk, you'd know before the next sun up, someone
was going to get hurt. He was going to hit someone.''
</P>
<P>
   When Matthews hit someone, it was not an issue to be taken
lightly, Price cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could pick up this tractor,'' Price said, gesturing to the
huge steel machine baking in the sun. ``He was a man; he weren't no
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Price felt Roger Matthews was a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played guitar together,'' he said, remembering good times
with Matthews. ``He could make a guitar talk.''
</P>
<P>
   One account
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Cobble, who says she saw Roger Matthews shoot her husband,
chain-smokes as she describes that night, her voice shaking with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just busted in the door one night and decided he was God,''
she said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   That night while Paul sat on the couch, smoking a cigarette and
watching TV, Tammy was cleaning the kitchen and preparing to lock
up for the night. Her children from a previous marrige were staying
overnight with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy heard a knock and seconds later, Roger Matthews pushed in
the door, knocking her back into the wall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 'Paul, it's Roger and he's got a gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger said, 'I thought you were my brother.' Paul said 'What
you talking about?' and Roger shot him twice. Then he pulled the
gun up on me,'' Tammy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Cobble raced down the hall and out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went around the house and kept falling over the rocks and
ladders. I reached the gate and cut my finger trying to get through
the barbed wire,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As she crouched in the tall grass outside her home, trying to
use the darkness as cover, she heard Roger calling to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying 'I can hear you. I'm going to find you,'''
Tammy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he couldn't hear me, because I was holding my breath,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy can't say how long Matthews is supposed to have searched
for her. It might have been minutes, but it seemed like hours.
Finally she heard a car pulling out of the gravel driveway,
spitting rocks up from under its wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, Paul was face-down on the floor. Although
Tammy had the phone in her hand, she didn't think to call 911. She
called her family for help.
</P>
<P>
   Between calls, she ran back and forth from the kitchen to Paul's
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling him to hold on, it was going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard gurgling noises,'' she said. ``And his face was
turning black. There was just a little bit of blood on his chest,
but a lot on his face. I thought he was shot in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers and family members, aroused by a relay of phone
calls, arrived about the same time, according to Tammy, with cars
lined up for a half mile down the one-lane road that leads to her
driveway.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like hundreds of people were in her house that night,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials told her Paul was dead, and they removed his body. In
her grief, she drove her family away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoved everybody out of the house. Even my mother. I went
into the kitchen, got some soapy water and started cleaning it up
so the kids wouldn't see it,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last thing I could do for Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Reputation around town Sheriff Ellett paused while trying to
think of a diplomatic way to describe Roger Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a history of doing things that are against the law.
How's that?'' he finally said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Logan feared Roger, but they felt his danger was
predictable, according to Nunley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was smoking pot or drinking beer, Roger ain't that bad,
he's just mouthy,'' Nunley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main time he would get real bad off and want to fight
somebody was when he was on whiskey or hard liquor. He was always
trying to fight somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to stay away from him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nunley was one of the first people on the scene when Farrell
Rutherford's body was found, still sitting in a chair in the open
shed next to the trailer he called home. His long, thin body had
folded over, and his face rested on his knees.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nunley, an empty bottle of vodka was sitting
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The duty of telling B.J. ``Jay'' Rutherford that his brother was
dead fell to Roger Matthews' father and brother.
</P>
<P>
   D.W. Matthews was crying when he came to the house that night,
Jay Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said 'I'd rather cut my arm off than tell you what I'm
going to tell you.''' Jay Rutherford recalled. ``He said 'Roger
done shot Farrell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jay went to his brother's trailer and angrily demanded that
deputies allow him to check his brother's body for a pulse. Farrell
had been shot once, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the heart,'' Jay Rutherford said, poking himself in
the center of his breastbone.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Rutherford had seen his older brother alive was
around sundown on Oct. 24. He was driving home for dinner when he
saw Farrell and Roger Matthews sitting together under the cover of
the shed, he said. He honked as he drove past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both waved,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Gary Matthews live together amid divided family
loyalties. Their 28-year-marriage straddles the fault line created
that murderous night.
</P>
<P>
   Gary is Roger Matthews' older brother. Peggy is Paul Cobble's
older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a place where we don't talk much about it,'' Peggy
Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband hasn't been to jail to visit Roger, nor has he gone
to any of the hearings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if he died to Gary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spiritual woman with a soft voice and dark hair, Peggy talks
about her family's turmoil matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   What may have gone on between their brothers hasn't damaged
their marriage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's drawn us closer,'' she said. ``Gary has
always been my strength, and I've always leaned on him. Now, he's
letting me know he needs my strength.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the healing process, they are trying to focus on
their grandchildren and the future, she said. She and Gary have
four children, three of them grown, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at me and say, 'She should be bitter, she should
be angry,' but I'm not,'' Peggy Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destroying Roger will not bring my brother back,'' she said
sadly. ``It won't restore my family the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Matthews balances her mother's feelings for those of her
in-laws. ``If I just knew why, maybe it would help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary couldn't help it. Peggy couldn't help it,'' explained
Pastor Barnett. ``But when it's all said and done, each one of them
is a brother short.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking answers
</P>
<P>
   Why Matthews would target his friends is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell Rutherford's neighbor, Ricky Nunley, considered the
question, leaning against the side of his pickup, one hand tucked
into the bib of his overalls, the other holding a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what puzzles everybody,'' he said. ``Why Paul?''
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Cobble thinks it was jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People took Paul into their homes _ into their hearts, and not
Roger,'' she said. ``He couldn't stand to not be loved again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerrold Price isn't so sure there is a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Paul?'' he said, repeating Nunley's question. ``Why
Farrell? Farrell couldn't hurt nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand it,'' he said. ``I think about it every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the family bonds uniting the people of Logan aren't strong
enough to withstand all that has happened, according to Jerrold
Price, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some people, and I'm not going to tell you who,''
Price said, ``but there's some who say if he does get out, they'll
kill him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Never mind that one robber had second thoughts and was
replaced at the last minute or that another did not shoot as
planned. Or that the bounty was only $6,000 instead of the expected
$30,000, or that the whole gang of seven men was arrested in less
than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of crime in revolutionary Cuba, the assault on a
government armored van in daylight last December during which five
people were wounded was a botched but spectacular act of boldness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard the shots, then I saw the wounded people go
by,'' said Marta Acosta, 59, who lives across the street from La
Arcada, the cluster of dollar stores in the municipality of
Guanabacoa here that was the scene of a shootout between one of the
thieves and two armored van workers picking up the shopping
center's receipts. ``It was shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the high-profile caper was the kind that government
officials used to associate more with the ills of American society
than with their highly policed island. But today Cuba, which for
decades was immune to the high crime rates of more open societies,
is itself grappling with a rising tide of common crime that has
swelled in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The rise is taking place as Cubans struggle with hardships
caused by the collapse of their Soviet patron 10 years ago,
Communist Party policies and more than three decades of economic
embargo by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Necessity now leads scores of people to steal from workplaces,
to earn dollars as illegal drivers or prostitutes and to join a
thriving black market. In rural areas, livestock theft is such a
problem, government officials said, that some people take their
cows into their homes at night.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem has also been fueled by the opportunity that has
arrived here along with increasing numbers of foreign tourists as
the government has slowly tried to open the island to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro himself sounded the alarm about crime in
a speech three months ago to the Revolutionary National Police,
associating it with a creeping moral laxity and Cuba's opening to
dollars, tourists and foreign investment in the mid-1990s, but
noting that those were the very sectors crime now endangered. Two
Italian tourists were fatally shot last September during a robbery,
even though handguns are not prevalent and legal access to them is
tightly restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fight against crime we're also defending the prestige
of the country and its economy,'' Castro said. ``The rise in crime
discourages tourism, aside from the damage it causes to 11 million
citizens and the uneasiness it produces.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the crime wave, the government has stationed
police officers on almost every corner in Havana's tourist areas
and in February stiffened penalties for crimes ranging from drug
trafficking and pimping to armed robbery and the illegal trade in
beef.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of special police officers distinctive for their
black berets has given parts of Havana, where officials say 80
percent of the island's crime take place, the feel of a city under
siege. In some areas the young officers are often seen checking the
identification cards of Cubans, writing tickets for some infraction
or giving instructions to drivers, cyclists and passers-by through
loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown, which government officials say is already
working, has been welcomed by many Cubans and foreigners who have
been victims of pickpockets and burglaries. But the heightened
vigilance is also stifling what some Cubans say is their only way
to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   What is most notable has been the virtual disappearance of
prostitutes from the streets after they have either being sent back
home to the countryside or interned in ``rehabilitation centers,''
work camps where repeat offenders receive counseling while putting
in up to four years of agricultural and other labor. While not
illegal here or penalized as a criminal offense, prostitution is
regarded as ``antisocial'' and a magnet for related crime such a
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Castro, disclosing rarely published crime
information, said the use of Cuba as a transshipment point for
Colombian cocaine destined for the United States and Europe
``persists.'' And he announced new, stricter penalties for drug
trafficking, which this year were made to range from 15 years in
prison to death. As an offshoot of the trafficking, there has also
been increased drug use in Cuba, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban leader also noted a loosening of morals. He excoriated
Cubans who drive tourists around and rent out rooms illegally,
police officers who accept bribes, parents and pimps who induce
young women to sell their bodies and those who steal merchandise
from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to fight through every legal means, including public
shame,'' he said. ``We have to inspect the inspectors, and also
control the controllers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But American and other Western officials say more controls only
invite more lawbreaking because illegal activity is the only way
many Cubans who do not get dollar remittances from family members
in the United States can complement their meager state salaries.
Most of those salaries are paid in a local currency that is no
longer accepted for many transactions that now take place in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A 31-year-old driver with a wife and two young sons who said he
earned 260 pesos a month, or $13, making bricks, said he could make
$40 or more driving a foreigner around for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western officials said that the anticrime measures and
policing went beyond what was warranted, serving to complement the
increased anti-American statements and a law, also passed in
February, to rein in the small but growing number of dissidents and
independent journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an impetus for more opening within Cuba and from
foreign countries that Castro feels went too far,'' a Western
diplomat here said. ``He's now aiming at telling us, `No, we stay
where we are.' That's rather unrealistic. The train is already
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Cubans say one reason for the rampant underground activity
is that legal alternatives, like the private restaurants and other
enterprises allowed since the mid-1990s as a way to deal with the
economic crisis, are too strictly regulated to make them worth the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   A retiree who rents rooms in his house to tourists here said he
had to pay 80 percent of his rental income to the government. ``You
can't stand out'' financially, said the man, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   At a dimly lit nightclub here near El Malecon, the capital's
seaside boulevard, some 40 young women in tight outfits and
platform shoes milled around the bar shortly before midnight on
Thursday, waiting for the ``extranjeros,'' or foreigners, to pick
them up. Despite the crackdown, many prostitutes have merely gone
underground, meeting men indoors, dressing more demurely or working
through pimps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is horrible,'' said a 32-year-old woman and
mother of two young sons, who said she is stopped almost every day
by police officers but is let go after showing her identification
card
</P>
<P>
   ``They're squeezing us too much,'' she said, asking a reporter
three times during a short conversation whether she was a police
officer. ``They don't let us breathe,'' she said. ``Look at all
these youths. Do you think we'd be here if not for the need?''
</P>
<P>
   But Jose Luis Toledo, president of the judicial affairs
commission of Cuba's National Assembly of People's Power, which
passed the tougher anticrime measures, argued in a recent interview
that while economic need was ``undoubtedly'' a factor in illegal
activity, most lawbreakers in Cuba are ``individualists wanting to
satisfy personal preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who engage in such activity are a minority,'' he said.
``Here we have a majority identified with the revolution and
willing to make sacrifices. We are trying to guarantee the safety
of that majority.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 4, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kosovo-related stories &LR;  (Moving in the `i' category):
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Serbia has
provoked strong opposition from many Eastern Orthodox Christians
and nations, raising the question whether there is in fact an
`Orthodox world' in the East that differs fundamentally from the
West in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks
not as a moral crusade against a clear evil, but as a hypocritical
Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox nation. By Serge
Schmemann. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWELL-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Powell Doctrine was a
strict and cautious policy _ espoused by Gen. Colin Powell when he
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ holding that the U.S.
should intervene militarily only when its vital interests are at
stake, only with decisive force, and only when there is a clear
goal and a defined strategy for getting out. After the 1991 Gulf
war, this idea was discarded as a post-Vietnam relic unsuited to
today's world. But the debacle in Kosovo is suddenly making
Powell's principles look more attractive. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HITECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slobodan Milosevic must be
laughing at U.S. threats to use high technology to hold him
accountable. Three years after the U.S. vowed to uncover evidence
of mass executions at Srebrenica, it seems clear that there are
limits to U.S. technology and that technology can be rendered
superfluous if it is used to mask a lack of political will. By
David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BALKANS-OUTLOOK-REVIEW _ Early summary: some
prognistications on what the Balkan region may be like two or three
years from now. By Roger Cohen. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other stories &LR;  (Moving in the `a' category):
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY-POLICING-REVIEW (Undated) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ostentatiously rejected proposals to implement
community policing, deriding such programs as turning police
officers into social workers. But, perhaps to Giuliani's surprise,
community policing is alive and working successfully in many
cities, from Chicago to San Diego and from Fort Wayne to Fort
Worth. By Fox Butterfield. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-PRIVACY-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Hidden in the
Microsoft Word document that carried the Melissa virus around the
world was an innocuous serial number that may help identify the
computer with which the program was written. It is a powerful
illustration of how technology has growing power for promoting both
good and evil, and is the heart of arguments over tradeoffs between
individual privacy rights and the common good. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The trustees report'
extending the projected solvency of Social Security and Medicare by
a few years was political manna for Congress. It made the problem
seem less urgent and provided an excuse for postponing tough
decisions until after the next elections. But demographic data
buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be
put off indefinitely. By David E. Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-MCGWIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up.
Expecting another `Can you hit 70 home runs again?'
question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis slugger was treated to the
first-ever reverse interview: He got to put questions to other
people, for a change. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   DEPORT-VETERANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent laws requiring the
deportation of resident aliens for minor offenses are being
challenged by supporters of several U.S. military veterans who face
expulsion under the law. Through legal challenges and a publicity
campaign on behalf of the veterans (at least one of who is disabled
due to combat wounds) the law's opponents are targeting what they
hope will prove to be its Achilles' heel: its extreme
inflexibility. By Mirta Ojita.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRICAL-WEBSITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Web sites that
make fun of companies. The sites allow disgruntled consumers to
express themselves. The target companies don't seem to see the
humor in this, so they're fighting back with their most familiar
weapon: money. By Timothy L. O'Brien.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 4, moved Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kosovo-related stories &LR;  (Moving in the `i' category):
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX-REVIEW (Undated) _ The NATO attack on Serbia has
provoked strong opposition from many Eastern Orthodox Christians
and nations, raising the question whether there is in fact an
`Orthodox world' in the East that differs fundamentally from the
West in its values and principles, that perceives the NATO attacks
not as a moral crusade against a clear evil, but as a hypocritical
Western assault against an Eastern Orthodox nation. By Serge
Schmemann. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-POWELL-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Powell Doctrine was a
strict and cautious policy _ espoused by Gen. Colin Powell when he
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ holding that the U.S.
should intervene militarily only when its vital interests are at
stake, only with decisive force, and only when there is a clear
goal and a defined strategy for getting out. After the 1991 Gulf
war, this idea was discarded as a post-Vietnam relic unsuited to
today's world. But the debacle in Kosovo is suddenly making
Powell's principles look more attractive. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HITECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Slobodan Milosevic must be
laughing at U.S. threats to use high technology to hold him
accountable. Three years after the U.S. vowed to uncover evidence
of mass executions at Srebrenica, it seems clear that there are
limits to U.S. technology and that technology can be rendered
superfluous if it is used to mask a lack of political will. By
David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BALKANS-OUTLOOK-REVIEW _ Early summary: some
prognistications on what the Balkan region may be like two or three
years from now. By Roger Cohen. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other stories &LR;  (Moving in the `a' category):
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNITY-POLICING-REVIEW (Undated) _ New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has ostentatiously rejected proposals to implement
community policing, deriding such programs as turning police
officers into social workers. But, perhaps to Giuliani's surprise,
community policing is alive and working successfully in many
cities, from Chicago to San Diego and from Fort Wayne to Fort
Worth. By Fox Butterfield. (on the section dress page)
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-PRIVACY-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ Hidden in the
Microsoft Word document that carried the Melissa virus around the
world was an innocuous serial number that may help identify the
computer with which the program was written. It is a powerful
illustration of how technology has growing power for promoting both
good and evil, and is the heart of arguments over tradeoffs between
individual privacy rights and the common good. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   SOCSEC-MEDICARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The trustees report'
extending the projected solvency of Social Security and Medicare by
a few years was political manna for Congress. It made the problem
seem less urgent and provided an excuse for postponing tough
decisions until after the next elections. But demographic data
buried in the trustees' report illustrated why the matter cannot be
put off indefinitely. By David E. Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-MCGWIRE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Mark McGwire's eyes lit up.
Expecting another `Can you hit 70 home runs again?'
question-and-answer fest, the St. Louis slugger was treated to the
first-ever reverse interview: He got to put questions to other
people, for a change. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   DEPORT-VETERANS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent laws requiring the
deportation of resident aliens for minor offenses are being
challenged by supporters of several U.S. military veterans who face
expulsion under the law. Through legal challenges and a publicity
campaign on behalf of the veterans (at least one of who is disabled
due to combat wounds) the law's opponents are targeting what they
hope will prove to be its Achilles' heel: its extreme
inflexibility. By Mirta Ojita.
</P>
<P>
   SATIRICAL-WEBSITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at Web sites that
make fun of companies. The sites allow disgruntled consumers to
express themselves. The target companies don't seem to see the
humor in this, so they're fighting back with their most familiar
weapon: money. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BIBLE-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The publishing industry _ no

EWING MAY HOLD THE KEY TO VAN GUNDY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 36, Patrick Ewing makes no apologies for becoming a creature
of habit. Same workout regimen. Same fade-away jump shot. Same
restaurants after the game. Same old Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeff Van Gundy, it's a good thing that Ewing is as loyal as
he is stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't want to play for another coach,'' Ewing said last
week. ``I don't want to play for Phil Jackson. Phil Jackson can
take his behind back to Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing may be in the twilight of his brilliant career, but the
Knicks' franchise center can apparently still execute a power play.
His endorsement of Van Gundy _ at a time when the coach's job
security and his relationship with Knicks management are tenuous at
best _ may be a factor in the club's decision about whether to
retain Van Gundy after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said he met last week with Dave Checketts, the president
of Madison Square Garden, and received guarantees from Checketts
that no coaching changes would be made this season or next season.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts confirmed the meeting through a spokesman, but would
not divulge specifics. But a team official said it was not uncommon
for Ewing and Checketts to discuss the club's future. Ewing was
influential in keeping John Starks and Charles Oakley at the
trading deadline in 1996, and has lobbied for Van Gundy when he has
come under fire the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't nothing going to happen next year,'' Ewing said when
asked about the club's plans for its coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fair or not, given the changes made to the roster during the off
season, management views a return to the Eastern Conference finals
as a measuring stick for the Knicks. Anything short of that goal,
and Van Gundy is thought to be out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   But while the final 18 games of the regular season and then the
playoffs may have more to do with the team's decision-making than
anything, Ewing's not-so-subtle message to Checketts could put the
franchise in a quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts and, by association, the team's ownership may have to
decide whether to part ways with Van Gundy, Ernie Grunfeld or both.
It's no secret that Van Gundy and Grunfeld, the team president,
rarely speak, and that issues of trust have become major problems
in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   If the organization decides that Van Gundy's run is over, and if
Ewing is to be taken at his word, would the Knicks have to consider
trading Ewing in the final two years of his four-year contract?
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely for two reasons: Ewing's $68 million deal would
almost insure that the Knicks could not get equal value in return,
and Checketts and Grunfeld have often said that they want Ewing to
retire a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ewing has said, half-jokingly, more than once, ``If Jeff's
gone, send me to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing how important stability is to success in the National
Basketball Association, Ewing is more than resistant to change.
Only in the last three seasons has he begun to trust his new
teammates enough to give up the ball in crucial situations.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand his stubbornness and his loyalty. Before
Van Gundy, he played for Hubie Brown, Bob Hill, Rick Pitino, Stu
Jackson, John MacLeod, Pat Riley and Don Nelson _ at one point,
eight coaches in 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Jeff to be back here,'' he said. ``I don't want to play
for another coach. I do not want to play for another coach. You
heard it from me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's Not West's Fault
</P>
<P>
   As they work in Glen Rice and tolerate Dennis Rodman, the Los
Angeles Lakers are still finding their balance and trying to look
like a team worthy of winning a title. If they don't realize that
goal this season, don't put the blame solely on Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, West, the Lakers' team president, was against
adding Rodman to the mix and privately told at least two close
associates that he did not think it was worth the gamble. Now, one
of the league's most successful executives _ the player whose
likeness is part of the NBA logo _ is watching his team become pro
basketball's next traveling circus.
</P>
<P>
   West is hoping beyond hope that the Lakers grow up before they
self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very talented, but to say we're a team right now is not
fair,'' West said by telephone from Portsmouth, Va., where he was
scouting some of the country's best college players. ``I think
we're trying to get past this tumultuous year, where so many things
have gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Rice, he added: ``In the last few games, he's demonstrated
why we have an interest in him. He's feeling out his role and
getting significant help.''
</P>
<P>
   But West is worried about Rodman, whose absences and
inconsistent play have undeniably been distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss, the Lakers' owner, was behind the Rodman acquisition
and the recent makeover _ which included not only a coaching
change, from Del Harris to Kurt Rambis, but also the overhaul of
four-fifths of a starting lineup that played for the Western
Conference championship last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to say what they want, but I do not own this
team,'' West said. ``I work for somebody. I try to implement what
my owner wants. And hopefully it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   A Legal 2-Pointer
</P>
<P>
   Showing that NBA battles are waged in the courtroom as much as
on the court in these post-lockout times, the league's lawyers went
2-0 last week on different coasts.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Latrell Sprewell's lawsuit against the league
_ challenging his 68-game suspension for choking his coach _ was
dismissed last Monday by a federal judge who said it was so
worthless that Sprewell must pay the NBA's court costs.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm representing the NBA charges from $200 to $400 an
hour for its lawyers. Though the league declined to comment, a
lawyer who does not represent the NBA said Sprewell could be
looking at a bill in the neighborhood of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In New York last Thursday, Sandra Ortiz-Del Valle, a former
referee who sued the league on charges of gender discrimination and
had been awarded $7.85 million by a jury last July, also lost big.
</P>
<P>
   The same judge who presided over the trial reduced the judgment
to less than $347,000 _ a loss of more than $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Ortiz-Del Valle was trying to become the
first woman to officiate an NBA game. After she applied for a
position with the league, the NBA says that it told her to gain
college experience before reapplying. Ortiz-Del Valle had refereed
in the United States Basketball League but did not have National
Collegiate Athletic Association or Continental Basketball
Association experience.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials with that level of experience, Violet Palmer and
Dee Kantner, broke the gender barrier last season and were hired as
NBA referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no gender discrimination here and there should have
been no award,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal
officer. ``And we are going to ask the second Circuit Court of
Appeals to reduce it to zero, which is where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Wants Jordan
</P>
<P>
   At least one future Hall of Famer is hoping Michael Jordan's
discussions about purchasing at least half of the Charlotte Hornets
are more than just talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he can stay involved in the NBA'' said Magic Johnson, who
owns 5 percent of the Los Angeles Lakers and serves as one of the
franchise's vice presidents. ``We didn't want to lose him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Jordan's possibly returning to his Wilmington, N.C., roots to
own a team, Johnson added: ``He played there. He's from there. He
couldn't have a better situation.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A TALE OF AN NBA ICON AND A JOURNEYMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Jordan wishes to own a team. Oliver Miller wants a team
to own up. These two basketball heavyweights of different classes
were in the news last week, challenging old-line typecasting from
opposite ends of the pro sports spectrum and getting
all-too-predictable results.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's bid to purchase a 50 percent stake of the Charlotte
Hornets from the team's embattled owner, George Shinn, was
reportedly being blessed and brokered by the National Basketball
Association commissioner, David Stern. Miller's complaint against
the Phoenix Suns was filed to the league to little acclaim by the
players' union director, Billy Hunter. Two distinctly separate
tales of leverage and weight remind us again that barriers fall
much faster for those with a healthy reservoir of celebrity,
connections and cash.
</P>
<P>
   If Stern can help it, we should expect Jordan to make his most
socially significant leap, from jock icon to black owner. But no
matter how much noise Hunter makes in the name of Miller, the
player's complaint against the Phoenix Suns is likely to fall on
deaf or insensitive ears.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller story dates back to Feb. 9, when the journeyman
center, whose well-publicized weight problems have all but
destroyed his seven-year career, pulled into Phoenix with the
Sacramento Kings. In front of a sellout crowd that included his
in-laws and children, Miller was cruelly parodied by a court jester
in a gorilla suit. The Suns' longtime mascot stuffed a tube under
his costume to dramatically increase his girth, donned a Miller
jersey, pretended to gorge himself on popcorn and then fell to the
floor, unable to get up.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of the incident shows Miller looking on, practically in
shock. His agent, Jeff Blakely, would later claim that a subsequent
binge, which forced Miller off the Kings' active roster, was the
result of this sad spectacle. After Blakely threatened a lawsuit, a
Suns vice president, Harvey Shank, apologized for Miller's being
``affected detrimentally,'' but justified the routine by calling it
``one in a long line of 18 years' worth of parodies of coaches and
players performed by the premier mascot in all of team sports.''
</P>
<P>
   To compare such an act with, say, a mascot wearing a
slicked-back wig, a la Pat Riley, is an unfathomable stretch. It
would have been bad enough had the Suns' mascot been a duck
deliberately humiliating a man who has struggled visibly,
painfully, with an eating disorder. Hunter looked at the tape of an
overwhelmingly white crowd whooping it up over the depiction of a
troubled black player as a ``fat, lazy ape'' and, with good reason,
saw something worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the history of this country, because blacks have
historically been portrayed as monkeys and apes, not only did they
disparage Oliver but they disparaged me and, based on what a lot of
players have told me, a lot of other people in our league,'' Hunter
said. ``It was in poor taste, inflammatory, and especially because
of what that vice president said.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hunter said what many African-American players undoubtedly
think when they pass through America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what a gorilla has to do with the Valley of the
Sun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This might be a good question for Stern to answer, when he
finished typing up statements on the suddenly promising Charlotte
ownership matter. If he can't have Jordan as a player, then Stern
assuredly recognizes the value of welcoming him back as the first
African-American owner with a controlling interest. Stern gets
points for trying to mediate the deal, but he loses them for being
asleep at the cash register on the Miller story, for doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That is hard to accept from a commissioner who fines players for
the slightest criticism of referees, for not hemming their shorts.
Not long ago, Milwaukee Coach George Karl took a hit in the wallet
for perpetuating his silly but hardly offensive feud with Wally
Walker, his former boss in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' owner, Jerry Colangelo, has waded into dangerous
social waters before. Several years ago he demanded that Richard
Dumas, a player suspended for using drugs, apologize to the city of
Phoenix before being reinstated. If Colangelo was so concerned
about Phoenix's fans, he would have reconsidered his end run around
them to get public money for an expensive baseball park. The Dumas
incident was nothing more than a grandstand play on a vicious
stereotype, a variation on this Miller theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get into a ball park or an arena, they pay the ticket
price and psychologically, they can justify anything,'' said Dr.
Jonathan F. Katz, a New York clinical sports psychologist. ``They
have thoughts about fat people, black people, gay people. And now
they are in a venue where they think these thoughts are
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern can't control what fans think, but he can do something
when one of his teams panders to those thoughts. Oliver Miller is
no future owner, no star, no Jordan. Inside one of David Stern's
arenas, he is entitled to the same decency, and respect.

 SPORTS COLUMN: McGWIRE, SOSA, AND THE UNCERTAIN STRIKE ZONE  
(ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)(jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hitting home runs is not like singing an encore at a concert. To
answer the applause, Bruce Springsteen or Whitney Houston can
always turn to the band and do one more, but this season it won't
be that easy for Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to do what they did
last year, much less improve on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened last year might never happen again,''
McGwire was saying early last week. ``For people to expect it to
happen is unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   But judging by ticket sales in St. Louis and Chicago, some
people expect McGwire and Sosa to hit 70 and 66 homers again, or at
least hope they will.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had anybody buying season tickets in Busch Memorial
Stadium requested seats in the upper deck in left field. But when
the Cardinals open the season there Monday night against the
Milwaukee Brewers, about 200 season-ticket holders (at $16 a game,
that's $1,296 a ticket) will be up there pleading for Big Mac to
unload his first homer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall season ticket total is approaching our record of
21,000 in 1990,'' said Jose Arnold, the Cardinals' ticket director.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Cubs return to Wrigley Field April 12 for their
home opener against the Cincinnati Reds, about 150 of what are
quaintly known as Bleacher Bums will be season-ticket holders (at
$15 a game, that's $1,215 a ticket) out there waiting for one of
Sosa's shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do sell a limited number of bleacher season tickets,'' said
Frank Maloney, the Cubs' ticket director, ``but that's double the
number we sold a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And those ticket sales are realistic. But for McGwire and Sosa
to match their numbers of last season is, as the Cardinals slugger
warned, indeed unrealistic. Even so, through Friday's games in
spring training, Sosa led all hitters with 11 home runs and McGwire
was tied for second with 9. And if they resume their friendly duel,
each could hit at least 50 again.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa hit his 66th homer in the final week of last season,
remember, the Cubs' right fielder was one ahead of McGwire, but the
Cardinals' first baseman responded, as he had all season, with five
homers in his last three games. Each inspired the other.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows if Sosa's 66 was an aberration; he hit only 36
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 sluggers who hit at least 50 homers in a season, only
two _ McGwire and Ruth _ ever increased their production in a
following season. And McGwire is the only one to increase his
production the next two years. He jumped from 52 in 1996 to 58 in
1997 to his record 70 last year; he is also the only slugger to hit
at least 50 in three straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth went from 54 in 1920 (his first year with the Yankees) to
59 the next year. But he skidded three times after 50-homer
seasons, dropping from 59 in 1921 to 35, and from his then-record
60 in 1927 to 54, then to 46.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. has hit 56 in each of the last two seasons, the
only slugger with at least 50 who did not go up or down. Sosa and
Greg Vaughn, now with the Reds after hitting 50 for the Padres last
season, must cope for the first time with the season after joining
the ``50 Club.''
</P>
<P>
   All the other members of the 50 Club skidded the next season,
notably Roger Maris, who went from 61 in 1961 to 33, and Hack
Wilson, who went from what was then a National League record of 56
in 1930 to only 13.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, the career leader with 755 homers, never hit 50 in
a season. His high was 47 in 1971 with the Atlanta Braves; he hit
34 the next year. After his other 40-plus years, he dropped from 44
in 1957 to 30 and from 45 in 1962 to 44 and then 24 in Milwaukee,
and from 44 in 1966 to 39, from 44 in 1969 to 38 and from 40 in
1973 (at age 39) to 20 in Atlanta. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A foggy factor for McGwire, Sosa and all hitters this season is
the uncertainty of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   When a Feb. 15 memo from Commissioner Bud Selig's office ordered
the umpires to call a higher strike (2 inches above the belt) as
well as tighten the strike zone on the outside of home plate, the
umpires filed a grievance; they argued that the rules had been
changed without their input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel all the umpires are following the directive in
spring training,'' said Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's new
executive vice president for baseball operations. ``But we intend
to be diligent in monitoring how the strike zone is called.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, the former Oakland general manager, remembered hearing
``players being more concerned about the next day's plate umpire
than the next day's starting pitcher; something's wrong there.''
And during last year's post-season, many pitches apparently wide of
the plate were called strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get the ball back over the plate,'' Alderson said,
``we'll see more strikes, more swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more home runs, too. Mark McGwire walked 162 times last
season, Sammy Sosa 73. But if hitters have to wonder what each
umpire's strike zone is, it will create more confusion than
confidence. Not only for sluggers, but for all those new
season-ticket holders out where the home runs land in St. Louis and
Chicago.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO allies have no plans to try to stop the
brutalities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo except through an
extended air campaign, which could continue for a ``few months,''
according to senior Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of ground troops, which Gen. Wesley Clark, the
NATO commander, has suggested is the only way to ``stop the
paramilitary murder'' of ethnic Albanian civilians, is not being
considered by President Clinton and his senior foreign policy
advisers, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the expulsions by the forces of President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia continue at their current rate, Kosovo could be
emptied of all its estimated 1.8 million ethnic Albanians in 10 to
20 days, NATO said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This pace of cleaning out the ethnic majority and the Serbs'
success against the rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army raise the
possibility that Milosevic, having achieved his objectives, may
soon stop and call for negotiations, a senior administration
official said Saturday. ``This is a scenario we are confronting,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the prospect of a Kosovo devoid of the people that the
NATO assault was supposed to protect, the goal of the airstrikes
remains that of damaging the Yugoslav forces so badly that
Milosevic will capitulate _ or, as a senior official put it, ``cry
uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   This could take ``weeks and weeks, months,'' one official said.
Another predicted a time frame of up to a ``few months,'' depending
on the weather and the ability of Milosevic's forces to move and
conceal their weapons and dodge NATO's missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most think that within a few months it can be achieved and
without the introduction of ground troops,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some NATO officials have used the term ``genocide''
to describe the violence accompanying a systematic effort by
Serbian security forces to clear hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo, Clinton administration officials argue
that sending in troops is not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Ground troops would take so long to organize that they would
``achieve too little, too late,'' the senior State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the current military campaign were made clear by
another senior official involved in Kosovo policy, who said that
Clinton made the ``most fateful decision of his presidency'' when
he decided to go ahead with the airstrikes without consideration of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely outcome envisioned by these officials would be
an ``international protectorate'' for Kosovo with the ethnic
Albanians able to return under the guard of NATO troops, who would
stay for a certain time.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of negotiating terms of a protectorate with
Milosevic, after all that he has done against the ethnic Albanians,
was more ``discomfiting'' than in the past, but was still part of
the policy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is thinking about the political arrangements
after he capitulates and accepts a negotiated outcome,'' said one
administration official, speaking of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The official did not say whether ethnic Albanian leaders had
been approached about such a solution for their people, many of
whom are now fleeing Kosovo in terror and whose homes are being
destroyed by the Serbs. It is not clear whether even NATO troops
and copious Western aid in rebuilding would be sufficient to induce
them to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was treated by Washington as a partner in, and then
guarantor of, the Dayton peace accord that brought a fragile
armistice to Bosnia, even though many described the Yugoslav leader
as the architect of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia. Only at the end
of last year did the State Department call Milosevic part of the
problem in the Balkans, rather than part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO diplomat cautioned that looking at Milosevic as
someone who would surrender and then negotiate was a fairly
dangerous proposition. ``In the Balkans, you win or die, there are
no defeats, no surrender,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly open-ended nature of the air campaign against
Milosevic was a theme of remarks by President Clinton on Friday,
when he spoke of the administration's efforts to organize aid for
the ethnic Albanians flooding over the borders of Kosovo into
Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be determined, we must be persistent, we must be
patient if we expect to see this mission through,'' Clinton said.
``Ultimately, we want to make it possible for the victims to return
home, to live in security and enjoy self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on the goal of self-government, even as ethnic
Albanians were being driven from the province of Kosovo, senior
administration officials said they believed an ``international
protectorate'' was looking like the best solution.
</P>
<P>
   Such a protectorate is envisaged as a legal entity somewhere
beyond the autonomy granted in the peace settlement proposed at
Rambouillet, France, but short of the independence that the ethnic
Albanians have sought, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and European allies have consistently opposed
independence for Kosovo, in part because of the precedent it would
set for other ethnic groups, in Europe and elsewhere, who also
might wish to redraw present sovereign boundaries.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Behind the public facade of resolution to see the air campaign
through, there are signs in the State Department, the National
Security Council and the Pentagon of whether it would work.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, one official described ``so much anxiety across
the board.'' Basic questions are being asked, like ``Is this guy
going to yield?'' one official said, referring to Milosevic. Even
the fundamental question ``Do we have the right strategy?'' was
being aired, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said he had often mused about what would be the
``big one,'' meaning the foreign crisis that would embroil the
Clinton administration and threaten to spin out of control. ``This
is the big one,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with administration officials on the Kosovo
strategy, an underlying theme to emerge was the recognition that
they could do little to stop the violence inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say with pain that the bombing, while justified by
Milosevic's behavior, is not going to stop Arkan or the
paramilitaries,'' the official said, referring to Zeljko
Raznatovic, a Serbian paramilitary leader indicted for war crimes
by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Having made the decision not to use ground troops, the
administration had no option but to plug away at the air campaign
and make the best of it, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian refugees have described in detail door-to-door
expulsions and families being forced onto trains and buses by
Serbian paramilitaries and dumped into neighboring Albania and
Macedonia without possessions or money.
</P>
<P>
   The officials acknowledged that conditions in Kosovo were likely
to deteriorate with a continued Serbian drive against the ethnic
Albanians. This worsening of conditions could increase the
frustration in Congress and the public with the seeming inability,
or reluctance, of the administration to stop the brutality, these
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that the success of the airstrikes will be
measured by a military objective rather than the objective of
ending the human crisis inside Kosovo, a senior official said that
the campaign would persist until Milosevic went ``down the tubes''
in his ability to control his forces.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme that the administration officials emphasized was
that Milosevic would ``capitulate'' or ``yield'' or ``come to the
negotiating table.'' These officials went out of their way to avoid
the idea of ``defeating'' him.
</P>
<P>
   During the bombing campaign, the administration is not seeking a
change of regime in Belgrade, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this stance assert that even as Milosevic carries out
extreme human rights abuses in Kosovo, the administration is still
willing to deal with him. Thus, the critics say, the administration
has been less specific than the British government in its
assertions that Milosevic has been responsible for genocide in
Kosovo. The State Department said last week that there were
``indications'' of genocide in Kosovo by Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   The senior NATO diplomat said that despite some differences
within the alliance, cohesion was strong, particularly after the
capture of the three U.S. soldiers by Milosevic's forces and the
continued atrocities against civilians. NATO members realize that
the future of the alliance is at stake and there are no signs of
buckling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all at a loss,'' the diplomat said, alluding to what he
called the bleakness in European capitals about how to end the
atrocities in Kosovo quickly and how to overcome Milosevic without
deploying ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the makings of a Greek tragedy _ of the unbelievable
overwhelming you,'' he added. ``We take one step, then we are
compelled to take another.''

 ON ROAD OF HARD KNOCKS TO THE DRAFT, No. 1 HOPEFULS TRY TO HOLD(jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Couch was anointed as the top pick in the National Football
League draft months ago. The title did not come with a crown, but
it should have come with body armor. That is because Couch is now
taking more shots than he ever did as a quarterback for the
University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Couch is learning the harsh reality of being rated the top
player: every move he makes is scrutinized and every pass he throws
in workouts is dissected.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Couch has made some rookie mistakes in his
dealings with National Football League teams and with choosing
agents. Those decisions have hurt him, and that has opened the door
for the Oregon quarterback Akili Smith to become the first choice
of the Cleveland Browns in the draft April 17.
</P>
<P>
   It may be harsh, even cruel, to hold a college player to almost
unreachable standards. These days NFL teams are so picky, at times
so oversaturated with information that if Superman declared himself
eligible for the draft some team would find a weakness. Yet the
microscopic inspection is understandable, especially in the case of
the Browns. This pick may be important to their franchise's
history, and one scout for the Browns, who did not want to be
identified, said that the closer they look at Couch the more
nervous they get.
</P>
<P>
   So it cannot be ruled out that the Browns will pass on Couch and
choose either Smith or the Texas running back Ricky Williams, who
has dropped the 20 pounds he gained once the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   What first raised questions about Couch in the minds of the
Browns is how he came to choose an agent, particularly an episode
that was almost identical to a scene in the film ``Jerry Maguire.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch was being heavily recruited by several agents, but
according to the agent Gary Wichard, Couch told him, ``You're my
guy,'' before boarding a plane to visit with International
Management Group, one of the most powerful agent firms in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Couch changed his mind once IMG guaranteed $3 million in
endorsement money and agreed to charge an extremely low fee to
negotiate his contract with the team that will eventually draft
him. Couch will pay IMG $50,000 for a service that would usually
cost about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a player's not living up to a handshake agreement is
common in the vicious agent game and usually is no big deal. What
made this situation unusual _ and awkward for Couch _ is that
Wichard is a close friend of Carmen Policy, the Browns' president.
</P>
<P>
   What hurt Couch even more, though, was a workout he held for all
NFL teams on March 11. The workout was run by IMG, something that
disappointed the Browns because they wanted to work him out
privately under the direction of the Browns' coaches instead of
former coaches hired by IMG. When Cleveland worked out Smith, it
was done in private and run by Chris Palmer, the Browns' head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Condon, who is Couch's agent at IMG, did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Smith threw 75 passes in his workout versus 46 for Couch.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Clark, director of football operations for the Browns,
said of Couch, ``He didn't knock anybody off their feet, but it
didn't look like arm strength is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Workouts put on by agents can be risky. If teams think they are
too orchestrated, as some felt about Couch's, there can be a
backlash.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to the University of Miami quarterback
John Walsh, who held a private workout run in a heavy-handed way in
March 1995 by the former San Francisco coach Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, no relation to Bill, was considered a possible
first-round draft choice, but his stock dropped sharply after that
workout and he ended up being chosen in the seventh round by the
Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   No scout or coach likes to have someone else do their job for
them. ``That's what we get paid to do,'' an NFL scout who attended
the Couch workout said. ``Couch did not come off that well because
he did not make certain throws, certain deep throws that I would
have liked to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns were clearly upset over the circumstances of the
workout and Couch got the message. He has scheduled a private
workout with the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, the former offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville
Jaguars, knows how to evaluate quarterbacks. When he was an
assistant with the New England Patriots in 1993, Palmer was
instrumental in the team selecting Drew Bledsoe over Rick Mirer.
Bledsoe went to a Super Bowl and Mirer was a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Couch has many attributes. He is smart in the pocket, throws a
nice post pattern and is a good leader. Smith has a much stronger
arm and throws a tighter spiral, but there are concerns about him
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Smith basically had just one solid year at Oregon and the Browns
are uncertain if that was a fluke or an indication of his true
talent. He has also had wildly different scores on the Wunderlich
intelligence test the league gives potential players. His first
score was a 13 out of 40, followed by a score of 37, then of 26,
according to Smith's agent, Leigh Steinberg. The Browns aren't sure
of what to make of those results, but there is no question that the
test is one of the most overrated tools to determine if a player
can perform well on the NFL level.
</P>
<P>
   If Couch has a good workout for the Browns, he could vault to
the top again. But this will be a close race between Couch, Smith
and Williams, one that seems destined to go to the final days.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants Bide Their Time
</P>
<P>
   NFL assistant coaches, who have been fighting for better
benefits, are close to reaching an agreement with the league, but
negotiations are on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that the assistants, who, among other things, want
the retirement age significantly lowered, will strike a deal with
the owners. But the league is concerned that if they give
assistants what they want then everyone from ticket-takers to
trainers will be in line, making their own requests.
</P>
<P>
   So while the NFL strategizes, the coaches wait.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Like Corey Miller
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Coach Dennis Green, on the signing of the former
Giants linebacker Corey Miller, said: ``We believe Corey can
rejuvenate his career with us. He's a big, strong guy who will have
a chance to start.'' ... Some coaches believe the Giants and Jets
made great moves with their tight ends: the Jets letting Kyle Brady
go and signing Eric Green, and the Giants picking up Pete Mitchell.
Getting Mitchell, one American Conference coach said, was the best
free-agent signing the Giants have made in years. ... Arizona
cornerback Chris McAlister was considered a middle first round pick
in the coming draft by some scouts, but his recent workouts have
vaulted him into the top 10. He recently ran a 4.38 40-yard dash on
grass and his vertical jump was 37 inches.

INDIA OFFERS RIGHTS TO ATTRACT ITS OFFSPRING'S CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Indian government last week initiated a
program that will make it easier for people of Indian descent
sprinkled around the globe to travel to their familial homeland and
to invest in it, but stopped short of giving them the right to
vote, which many of them have sought.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that doctors, lawyers and bankers, as well as
executives in multinational corporations and others among the
millions of people of Indian descent living around the world will
invest in India, or convince others with deep corporate pockets to
do so, contributing to the country's economic growth, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a broader mass base who may be willing to invest
in India,'' said Anin Trigunayat, an officer in the passport and
visa division of the Ministry of External Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The new program came in the same week that Indian officials
announced loosened import restrictions on almost 900 consumer and
agricultural goods, a step aimed at encouraging foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   Indian embassies and consular offices last week began accepting
applications for the so-called Persons of Indian Origin card, which
will be issued for a fee of $1,000 and be good for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will entitle people of Indian descent who are citizens of
other countries to travel to India without a visa, buy and sell
real estate here (except for farmland), invest in government bonds
that only Indian citizens living abroad could buy before, and apply
for admission to Indian colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The steps are part of a broader recognition by a growing number
of countries that people who move abroad remain potentially
valuable contributors in an economically interdependent world.
</P>
<P>
   For the large and prosperous settlements of Indians in the
United States, Canada and the Caribbean, the new card will make it
easier to sustain close ties to India. Lower air fares and
telephone rates, as well as communication by e-mail and fax, have
already tightened the connections between India and its diaspora of
about 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the hunger of Indians abroad to have their
children linked to their country of origin,'' said Home Minister
L.K. Advani, who said introduction of the card was motivated by a
desire for closer ties between India and its diaspora, not for
their investment dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A number of nations have gone even further than India, allowing
dual citizenship for emigrants. For example, Mexico, Costa Rica,
Italy and the Dominican Republic permit their nationals to retain
native citizenship, with full political rights, even after they
become citizens of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Advani said his political party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, supports dual citizenship, but does not now have the
political support to win approval for a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new card is a step toward welcoming back people of
Indian descent, he said. All Indians who have become citizens of
other countries, as well as their children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, will be eligible for the card.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People from neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, however, will
not be eligible, because officials say they worry that the card
could become a vehicle for illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Since India began opening its economy in 1991 to greater foreign
investment, Indian citizens living abroad and people of Indian
descent have accounted for almost a quarter of the direct foreign
investment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the new card will encourage more investment,'' said
A.R. Nanda, the chief commissioner for investments and nonresident
Indians at the government's Indian Investment Center. ``The main
advantage is that they don't have to bother about a visa. They can
come and go whenever they want. It's hassle-free.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Saturday urged Americans to
donate money for food, water, medicine, blankets, clothing and
shelter to help the hundreds of thousands of refugees driven from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia aimed ``to keep Kosovo's land while ridding
it of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the NATO bombing began, ``Serbian forces have intensified
their attacks against innocent civilians,'' he said. ``An entire
people are being made to abandon their homeland or die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among them are elderly people, who have lived their whole
lives in peace with their neighbors, only to be told now to leave
everything behind in minutes or to be killed on the spot,'' Clinton
said. ``Among them are small children who walked for miles over
mountains, sometimes after watching their fathers and uncles and
brothers taken from them and shot before their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had authorized $50 million in emergency funds to
help the refugees fleeing Kosovo and had instructed the Pentagon to
organize efforts to provide emergency supplies of food, clothing
and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States would work with the United Nations and
nongovernmental organizations to help the Kosovars, and urged
Americans to call the Red Cross or to contact charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo's neighbors, Macedonia and Albania, are taking the
refugees in, despite the huge burden this places on these poor,
struggling nations,'' he said. ``So are Greece, Bosnia and
Bulgaria, showing there's more mercy than madness in the Balkans,
more compassion than cruelty in this troubled region of the world.
We also must open our hearts and our arms to the innocent victims
of this conflict.''

WOMEN ARE SPEAKING OUT TO HEAL TRAUMA OF RAPE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kans.)   By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Betty Liebert was getting into her car to go home
after a night out with friends when a man hit her from behind and
took from her all her life had been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw who it was,'' Ms. Liebert says, recalling the
night of Nov. 9, 1990. ``He hit me in the head. I lost
consciousness for a little bit. He raped me and dumped my purse out
over my back to use my back as a table to sort through what he
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liebert, now 43, did not call the police, but went home,
took a shower, threw away everything her attacker had touched and
did not say a word about her rape to anyone for more than a year.
In that time, Ms. Liebert, a woman whose affinity for adventure
included bodybuilding, running, camping and mountain biking, feared
leaving her house, and she began to drink heavily and suffer
episodes of rage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost nine years later, Ms. Liebert and several others who
have lived through rape are speaking out about it in Los Angeles,
both in a public service announcement broadcast on television and
at a conference on April 17 intended to help other victims. In
speaking out, the women are further lifting what has traditionally
been a protective curtain of anonymity to unveil the faces _
mother, fiancee, the elderly _ of what they call a ``secret
sorority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When women are willing to go public, it strips away the
curtain and distance from the pain of the experience,'' said
Rosanna Hill, a coordinator of the conference and member of the
Rainbow Sisters Project, which is sponsoring it.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, at the Los Angeles Public Library, is billed as
a day to honor women who have been raped and those who have raised
public awareness about it. The public service announcement, filmed
in black and white, is a parade of women who say: ``I am a mother.
I am a senior citizen. I am a wife. Soy tu hermana. I am East
German. I am hopeful. I am, ah, about to be married. I am learning
to trust. I am angry. I am happy to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It was directed by Kate Miller, an executive at Capitol Records
who was holding a summer barbecue with friends in 1994 when two men
broke into her home, tied her and her friends up, put guns in their
mouths and raped them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to take back what was taken from you is to turn
it around and make it positive, and sharing with others,'' Ms.
Miller said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a study released last year and sponsored by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of
Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, 18 percent of
female respondents said they had been raped or had suffered an
attempted rape.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and experts estimate that as many as 60 percent of
women who are raped never report it. Such was the case for a woman
in the public service announcement, who asked not to be identified
by name. The woman did not tell the police that she had been raped
even though her attacker, whom she met at work and had spent hours
talking to, continued to contact her as if the attack had not
happened. She said she had thrown herself into her work to keep her
mind off the attack and did not seek help until she moved to Los
Angeles four years ago when she heard an advertisement on the radio
for a rape counseling service.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Spencer, 52, a senior executive assistant at Neutrogena, was
raped 22 years ago in her home in Kansas by an intruder who, she
says, considered aloud whether to kill her. When Ms. Spencer
eventually sought help, she was told she had post-traumatic stress
disorder, a syndrome known to affect some soldiers after combat.
She says there are days now when she is free of the memory, though
there are reminders, like hearing other rape stories and jokes
about rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she said in an interview, ``it's when a man looks
at my body before he looks in my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But if it is painful to recount the incident, and to hear many
similar stories, Ms. Spencer said, it will ultimately be
worthwhile. She said she wanted to take part in the public effort
``to help myself and to help other women, and to take some of the
element of shame away from the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything you shed light on is a healing process,'' she
added.

FAMILY EXTENDS GIVING SPIRIT TO EASTER FOR SKID ROW KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a Daily News columnist) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The kids from the neighborhood will show up at
Clancy's place all scrubbed and clean, ready to sit down for a
nice, hot Easter dinner.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the ragged clothes on their backs, Clancy
says, they'd look like every other kid in this city going to Easter
dinner with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   But these children are not that lucky. They were born into
families barely getting by _ families that come to Clancy's every
year for Easter Sunday dinner because they have no other place to
go.
</P>
<P>
   So they scrub their faces, clean their ragged clothes as best
they can and walk the few blocks over to Clancy's place _ the
Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a good meal for them _ ham, yams, baked potatoes,
vegetables and milk,'' Clancy Imislund, director of the mission,
was saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when we give them
the other thing. They're going to be so surprised and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing: Easter baskets that a suburban Van Nuys family
and their friends were busy making Saturday afternoon so kids
living in tenements and shelters on Skid Row would have what every
other kid celebrating Easter has today.
</P>
<P>
   A big basket filled with goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Watson and her daughter, Miesha, were putting the
finishing touches on a few dozen Easter baskets they were making to
sell at a fund-raiser recently at the Los Angeles elementary school
where Miesha teaches sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, they were laughing and carrying on. This little
in-home basket-making business the Watson family had started was
paying dividends _ not just in some extra spending money, but by
helping keep their family close.
</P>
<P>
   In the other room, Linda's husband, Foriest, and their
22-year-old son, Foriest III, were working on more baskets while
talking and watching sports on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great to make up some of these baskets and give
them out to kids who won't be getting any baskets this Easter?''
Miesha, 26, said to her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Watson nodded. ``You always hear about people giving toys
and presents to needy kids at Christmastime, but what about the
other 364 days of the year?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day she asked co-workers at the Center for Government
Studies in West Los Angeles if they knew of any shelters or
charities where a lot of kids would be coming for a free Easter
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned the Midnight Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Clancy Imislund hung up the telephone and smiled. He could tell
just by her voice that he was going to like this woman named Linda
Watson. She had a good heart, and she was smart.
</P>
<P>
   She was also very right. At Christmastime, the phones at the
Midnight Mission and other downtown shelters ring constantly, with
people feeling the holiday spirit and wanting to help the homeless
and neighborhood families living in poverty on Skid Row.
</P>
<P>
   But Linda's call was the only one he had received this Easter
from a person wanting to come down to the mission and help.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody pretty much forgets the people who live down here the
rest of the year, Clancy told her. And, more and more, those people
were mothers with young children.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's clientele today is a far cry from the days it
operated out of Brother Tom Liddicoat's Skid Row hotel room back in
the early part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Men, down and out, gathered at night in Brother Liddicoat's room
to listen to him preach hellfire and damnation _ lost souls waiting
for the clock to mercifully strike midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the men could sit through the sermon, he gave them a meal
at midnight,'' Clancy said. ``That's how we became known as the
Midnight Mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are no religious sermons _ no holding a Bible in
one hand and a meal in the other, says Clancy, who has been
director of the mission for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Would the 90 to 100 Skid Row children he expects to come to
dinner today with their families like to have their own Easter
basket?
</P>
<P>
   You bet, Clancy Imislund told Linda Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to think it's absolutely wonderful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Watson picked up the phone again after talking with Clancy
and began spreading the word. She needed help, and she needed it
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Her family had less than a week to make 100 Easter baskets for
the kids having dinner at the Midnight Mission this year.
</P>
<P>
   She could desperately use some more hands and help in buying the
milk chocolate bunnies, jelly beans, eggs and balloons for the
younger children, and some school supplies for the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Could they help? The answer was there Saturday afternoon in the
Watson's Van Nuys apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, customers, co-workers, members of her church, and even
her car mechanic _ more than a dozen people making and filling up
Easter baskets so some kids living on Skid Row would have more than
a free meal this Easter.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have what every other kid celebrating Easter in this
city will have.
</P>
<P>
   A basket.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ An enormous luxury liner lies empty and dark at
the municipal pier here, pulling against its shore lines and
straining, people who are fighting to save it say, for open water.
</P>
<P>
   But seafaring is a distant past and unlikely future for the
ship, the United States. Its paint is chipped and flaking, its
lifeboats long gone, and even the reds, whites and blues of its
raked funnels have faded into pastels.
</P>
<P>
   The task facing its owner and an avid band of preservationists
is not focused on ocean voyages but simply on gaining a secure
future for a behemoth that stands seven stories high, weighs 59,000
tons and stretches nearly 1,000 feet _ or ``110 feet longer than
Titanic and she's still floating,'' as one slogans says.
</P>
<P>
   To raise money for the ship, Robert Hudson Westover has formed
the SS United States Foundation and a Web site
(SS-United-States.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``This ship is just too beautiful and too important to let slip
through our fingers,'' Westover said. ``She represents the finest
American engineering and the fastest ocean travel of her day. I
can't imagine people wouldn't care about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big U,'' as the ship came to be known to sailors, steamed out
of New York on its first voyage on July 3, 1952, and passed
Bishop's Rock off the coast of England 3 days, 10 hours and 40
minutes later, shaving 10 hours from the record the Queen Mary had
held since 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Its average speed was 35 knots, or 40 miles an hour, and her top
speed was a national security secret in a day when passenger liners
were still on reserve as troop carriers.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States passed the Queen Mary on a later voyage,
it radioed, ``Sorry, old girl.'' The Queen Mary radioed back,
``Your girls are faster than our girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States made 400 crossings before being pushed aside
by jet travel in 1969, and its backers hope that fond memories
among her one million passengers still living will help preserve
her.
</P>
<P>
   With the drama of the Titanic still in the air, and the
fashion-conscious in love with retro style, the ship's owner and
the preservationists are following a two-pronged campaign to give
the ship a new life. While the owner looks for deals, Westover and
a loose alliance of other fans of the ship are raising money to
build a safety net under it.
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Cantor, a developer of commercial real estate in
northern New Jersey, bought the United States in 1997 for $6
million from one of several failed ventures that have tried to turn
the ship into a commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Fair, an engineer who supervises Cantor's interest in
the ship, said several groups had presented different options, most
of them with the goal of duplicating the role of the Queen Mary,
now a successful hotel and convention center at Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was stripped of its fittings after its final
voyage, in 1969, and Fair estimated that it would cost at least
$250 million to make the ship habitable. So, he was asked, was it
profit or romance that lured Cantor to buy the ship and spend
$100,000 a month in wharfage, security, insurance and upkeep ever
since?
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance is part of it,'' Fair replied. ``If it was just about
money, he could have scrapped it when he didn't have so much
invested and still taken a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible solution was offered by Frank O. Braynard, a maritime
museum curator at the U. S. Merchant Marine Academy, in Kings
Point, N.Y., and the author of ``The Big Ship,'' about the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one hope is that New York City may do what California did
with the Queen Mary and put her next to the carrier'' Intrepid, a
World War II ship that is a museum on the Hudson River pier in
Manhattan, Braynard said. ``But it would be a headache,'' he added,
``because it's very, very expensive to keep a ship up.'' Cantor is
looking for buyers _ the price is $30 million, firm _ but says he
will listen to proposals for joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Arnold Agency, a Richmond advertising firm,
began creating material for a nationwide publicity campaign built
around the theme ``Save the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But saving large artifacts from the age of steam is one of the
most difficult tasks for preservationists these days, said Emory L.
Kemp, a professor of history and civil engineering at West Virginia
University, where he heads the Institute for the History of
Technology and Industrial Archeology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of surviving battleships that are preserved
by various states _ the Texas, the North Carolina and the
Massachusetts _ but they are strictly tourist sites,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   At 990 feet, the United States is bigger than any American
battleship; and to visitors who delve like spelunkers into her
silent, cave-black lower decks, the ship presents an eerie and
seemingly endless maze of heavy machinery, ladders, pipes and
motors.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction gears that drove the ship's four propeller shafts
still glisten under bolted hatches. Engineers' reports, in pencil
and fountain pen, still rest in filing cabinets next to the
enormous boilers, and 30-year-old metal shavings are scattered
around an industrial-sized lathe in the repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine how many people would love to see this,'' Westover
said on a recent exploration. ``It's like being underwater.''

FAMILY EXTENDS GIVING SPIRIT TO EASTER FOR SKID ROW KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a Daily News columnist) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The kids from the neighborhood will show up at
Clancy's place all scrubbed and clean, ready to sit down for a
nice, hot Easter dinner.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the ragged clothes on their backs, Clancy
says, they'd look like every other kid in this city going to Easter
dinner with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   But these children are not that lucky. They were born into
families barely getting by _ families that come to Clancy's every
year for Easter Sunday dinner because they have no other place to
go.
</P>
<P>
   So they scrub their faces, clean their ragged clothes as best
they can and walk the few blocks over to Clancy's place _ the
Midnight Mission in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a good meal for them _ ham, yams, baked potatoes,
vegetables and milk,'' Clancy Imislund, director of the mission,
was saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when we give them
the other thing. They're going to be so surprised and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thing: Easter baskets that a suburban Van Nuys family
and their friends were busy making Saturday afternoon so kids
living in tenements and shelters on Skid Row would have what every
other kid celebrating Easter has today.
</P>
<P>
   A big basket filled with goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Watson and her daughter, Miesha, were putting the
finishing touches on a few dozen Easter baskets they were making to
sell at a fund-raiser recently at the Los Angeles elementary school
where Miesha teaches sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, they were laughing and carrying on. This little
in-home basket-making business the Watson family had started was
paying dividends _ not just in some extra spending money, but by
helping keep their family close.
</P>
<P>
   In the other room, Linda's husband, Foriest, and their
22-year-old son, Foriest III, were working on more baskets while
talking and watching sports on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great to make up some of these baskets and give
them out to kids who won't be getting any baskets this Easter?''
Miesha, 26, said to her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Watson nodded. ``You always hear about people giving toys
and presents to needy kids at Christmastime, but what about the
other 364 days of the year?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day she asked co-workers at the Center for Government
Studies in West Los Angeles if they knew of any shelters or
charities where a lot of kids would be coming for a free Easter
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Someone mentioned the Midnight Mission.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Clancy Imislund hung up the telephone and smiled. He could tell
just by her voice that he was going to like this woman named Linda
Watson. She had a good heart, and she was smart.
</P>
<P>
   She was also very right. At Christmastime, the phones at the
Midnight Mission and other downtown shelters ring constantly, with
people feeling the holiday spirit and wanting to help the homeless
and neighborhood families living in poverty on Skid Row.
</P>
<P>
   But Linda's call was the only one he had received this Easter
from a person wanting to come down to the mission and help.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody pretty much forgets the people who live down here the
rest of the year, Clancy told her. And, more and more, those people
were mothers with young children.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's clientele today is a far cry from the days it
operated out of Brother Tom Liddicoat's Skid Row hotel room back in
the early part of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Men, down and out, gathered at night in Brother Liddicoat's room
to listen to him preach hellfire and damnation _ lost souls waiting
for the clock to mercifully strike midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the men could sit through the sermon, he gave them a meal
at midnight,'' Clancy said. ``That's how we became known as the
Midnight Mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are no religious sermons _ no holding a Bible in
one hand and a meal in the other, says Clancy, who has been
director of the mission for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Would the 90 to 100 Skid Row children he expects to come to
dinner today with their families like to have their own Easter
basket?
</P>
<P>
   You bet, Clancy Imislund told Linda Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to think it's absolutely wonderful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Watson picked up the phone again after talking with Clancy
and began spreading the word. She needed help, and she needed it
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Her family had less than a week to make 100 Easter baskets for
the kids having dinner at the Midnight Mission this year.
</P>
<P>
   She could desperately use some more hands and help in buying the
milk chocolate bunnies, jelly beans, eggs and balloons for the
younger children, and some school supplies for the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Could they help? The answer was there Saturday afternoon in the
Watson's Van Nuys apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, customers, co-workers, members of her church, and even
her car mechanic _ more than a dozen people making and filling up
Easter baskets so some kids living on Skid Row would have more than
a free meal this Easter.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have what every other kid celebrating Easter in this
city will have.
</P>
<P>
   A basket.

AT U.N., ACTIVISTS VIE WITH VATICAN OVER ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a novel twist to the fight over legal
abortion, an organization of Roman Catholic activists has begun a
drive to demote the diplomatic status of the Vatican at the United
Nations, though in reality it only hopes to curb its lobbying
style.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for a Free Choice, which says it has 8,000 members and
disagrees with the Catholic Church's traditional opposition to
abortion and birth control, is leading a coalition of more than 70
similar voluntary organizations seeking to downgrade the Vatican
status from ``permanent nonmember state observer'' to a more modest
``nongovernmental organization.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of only two such nonmember observer states, along with
Switzerland, the Holy See, as the Vatican calls itself at the
United Nations, is entitled to take part in U.N. policy-setting
conferences and to vote on the recommendations they issue just like
any member government of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Vatican cannot vote in the annual General Assembly,
Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II have addressed the world group,
and the Vatican's permanent observer addressed its 10th special
session on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other Christian sects like the Anglicans and the
Methodists, as well as major faiths, such as Islam, Buddhism and
Judaism, are represented by accredited nongovernmental
organizations that have none of those privileges.
</P>
<P>
   They may only address policy-making U.N. meetings by invitation
and cannot vote on recommendations, though they can lobby delegates
in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to challenge the Vatican's pretense to be a
state,'' said the Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a
Free Choice. ``Why should a few acres of office space and tourist
attractions in the center of Rome have a voice in making United
Nations policy? The Roman Catholic Church deserves the same
nongovernmental status as the World Council of Churches or any
other religious body,'' she said last week in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``To insure the United Nations does not promote one particular
religious view, religious entities like the Catholic Church should
not be given the status of a nonmember state,'' said Anika Rahman,
of the Washington-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   So far Catholics for a Free Choice and its allies have
distributed 5,000 postcards to other nongovernmental organizations
accredited here. They are addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and ask him to open ``an official review of the Holy See's
status at the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   A further 15,000 postcards have been printed and will be given
to other interested organizations in countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the campaign to demote the Vatican, which was
begun in late March, readily concede their aim is to curb the
ceaseless campaign it wages to stop the world organization from
doing or saying anything that even appears to condone abortion or
artificial contraception or to weaken what it sees as traditional
family values.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they resent the bargaining strength the Vatican
enjoys through being able to vote at international policymaking
meetings, which traditionally try to reach consensus. ``By
threatening to force a vote they compel opponents to compromise,''
Ms. Kissling said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican delegation to the United Nations declined to comment
on the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican first started to take part in such U.N. conferences
through its membership in the Universal Postal Union and the
International Telecommunications Union, since it issues stamps and
runs a radio station.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 the Vatican changed its name at the organization to Holy
See and in 1964 Secretary General U Thant granted it permanent
observer status on his personal authority.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper titled, ``Church or State: the Holy See at the United
Nations,'' Ms. Rahman argues that by calling itself the Holy See
the Vatican has ceased to meet some of the definitions of statehood
laid down in the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of
States.
</P>
<P>
   Although it can undoubtedly enter into relations with other
states, she argues that the Holy See, which describes itself as
``the supreme organ of government of the Catholic Church,'' cannot
possess a defined territory or a permanent population since it says
it governs a universal church.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since the Holy See is itself ``the government of both
the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican City'' it cannot be ``an
entity that possesses a government.''
</P>
<P>
   But many international lawyers question those arguments partly
because the Vatican still acts like a state but mainly because all
U.N. members have accepted it as a state for more than 30 years.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO said Saturday that it was planning to
send a force of 6,000 to 8,000 troops to Albania to provide
security and emergency relief for the masses of Kosovo Albanians
who have been driven from neighboring Yugoslavia by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is mobilizing all its available resources for this urgent
humanitarian requirement,'' the alliance's spokesman, Jamie P.
Shea, said. He announced that allied ambassadors had asked the top
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, for a plan to
deploy an operational headquarters, helicopters, troops, and
supplies to Albania as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   More than 165,000 refugees have arrived in Albania from Kosovo
since the allies began bombing to try to stop the Serbian campaign,
according to allied officials. Shea said that 55,000 people crossed
into Albania Friday alone, and that 290,000 Kosovo Albanians had
fled into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that despite the allied missile attacks that
blew up the Yugoslav and Serbian Interior Ministries headquarters
in the heart of Belgrade shortly after midnight, bad weather has
kept large numbers of allied planes from going after the Serb
forces driving the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. Those operations
would have to wait till the weather cleared, allied commanders
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the blows to the Yugoslav capital, President Slobodan
Milosevic showed no signs of relenting in his campaign against the
1.8 million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate,'' Shea said Saturday, ``if you do a mathematical
calculation, Serb forces will have emptied Kosovo of its entire
population in 10 to 20 days.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others here deny that the air campaign included Milosevic
as a target. ``That is not the business that we're into,'' said the
British air commodore, David Wilby, the allied military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials here believe that the Serbian campaign is aimed
at emptying a large triangle of territory in Kosovo, roughly a
triangle between Pristina, the provincial capital, and the cities
of Pec and Prizren, of its ethnic Albanian inhabitants and
replacing them with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some reports of Serbian refugees from the Krajina
entering Kosovo,'' said Edgar Buckley, a British official,
referring to a region of Croatia that was largely emptied of Serbs
in fighting in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With clouds and rain keeping most of the 450-odd allied planes
from hitting the Serbian military and police forces enough to keep
them from driving more refugees out, the allies are now being
forced to deal with the humanitarian disaster spreading into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who met with the
Albanian president and prime minister Saturday in Tirana, canceled
a stopover in Rome to fly to Skopje, Macedonia, where the
government has halted the flow of refugees, concerned that the
massive influx of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could upset the
ethnic balance of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their concerns are absolutely legitimate and understandable,''
Talbott said, after meeting with Kosovo refugees in a tent city of
2,000 in Tirana. ``We are seeing with our own eyes today a policy
on the part of Yugoslavia to undercut the viability of neighboring
states.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We are dealing with a rogue dictator who is
systematically and with premeditation using refugees as a means of
destabilizing neighboring states.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott's delegation also sped to Macedonia with the aim of
pressuring its leaders to open up the borders again and let the
refugees in, another American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, commanding a
force of more than 10,000 British, French and German troops in
Macedonia that was originally intended for a peacekeeping mission
in Kosovo, was ordered Saturday to put all of them to work helping
Macedonia deal with the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Ministry officials in London said 200,000 Kosovo
Albanians were now trying to flee toward Macedonia on the road from
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also say they have observed about 25,000 people
backed up inside Kosovo behind the border crossing point waiting
for the Serb authorities to let them pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Macedonia, a country with a delicate ethnic balance, has
absorbed 55,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in the last few weeks.
Saturday authorities said they would bar any more from coming in,
fearing that the country could be overwhelmed by the human
catastrophe that has seen 20 percent of the people of Kosovo driven
from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let you down,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair told the
refugees in a British television interview Saturday. ``We will make
sure that you are able to return to your homes, and live in your
homes in peace,'' he said. ``That is our promise to you and we will
carry it out.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The allies have also expressed concern about the situation in
Montenegro, which is federated with Serbia within Yugoslavia.
Milosevic replaced eight Yugoslav military commanders in Montenegro
this week, allied officials said, and could be preparing a coup
there.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that Jackson had already asked for 1 million food
rations, 50,000 gallons of drinking water, and 187,000 blankets and
was setting up a feeding station for the refugees near the border
with Kosovo. Three American soldiers on a border patrol fell into
Serbian hands earlier in the week and were taken prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which fears an uncontrolled influx of refugees across the
Adriatic, asked its allies on Friday to create a force to ensure
the safety of the refugees in Albania. Italy has offered to lead
the force and provide most of the soldiers for it, according to an
Italian official here.
</P>
<P>
   American, British and French warplanes continued to launch
attacks from bases in Italy Saturday, officials said, in an effort
to stop the Serb persecution and stem the refugee flow before it
overwhelms the entire Balkans region.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the allies met here to discuss other emergency steps to
deal with the victims of the violence in Kosovo, British and NATO
officers said that American and British cruise missiles launched
from ships at targets in central Belgrade in the predawn hours this
morning had caused no significant damage to civilian buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile attacks destroyed the Serbian and Yugoslav
Interior Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Air Marshal John Day, chief of the British defense staff in
London, described these headquarters as ``the nerve center of
operations planned to drive out ethnic Albanians in a campaign of
violence, intimidation, and thuggery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's attacks will continue and can be intensified even
further if necessary,'' he said. ``The weather is forecast to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only need a couple of days of good weather to be able to
have a maximized effect,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said that an unspecified number of allied planes had
managed Friday to hit staging areas used by the Yugoslav 547th
Mechanized Brigade for attacks against civilians, but he did not
say how much damage the planes did.
</P>
<P>
   The location of the attacks was in three areas along the road
between Prizren and Djakovica in southwestern Kosovo.

 &HT;    ACOG account: Millions still left to spend
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games reported publicly on its finances, it said there would be
nothing left for local youth sports programs after a huge debt was
paid off to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost two years ago, when the committee still had $65
million in the bank. Since then, tens of millions have changed
hands among ACOG, its top officers, its stadium construction team,
its lawyers and the tiny Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation.
Nearly $11 million remains in its account.
</P>
<P>
   Among those surprised to learn ACOG has not closed its books and
continues to write checks are some of its own board of directors.
``I find that to be truly astonishing,'' attorney Michael Coleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not still on the board, am I?'' asked Sam Massell,
president of the Buckhead (Business) Coalition. ``I thought they
closed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG officials said the committee will wind down this summer
when all accounts are settled, including a few legal disputes over
such matters as private property rights and a missing painting.
They intend to use any leftover funds to pay off a $22 million loan
from the USOC in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stogner, the financial director who still works part
time in ACOG's small office at the Inforum, said about half the
debt has been repaid and he hopes to use any remaining funds in
ACOG's account to eliminate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave youth sports out in the cold. Under an early
agreement with the International Olympic Committee and the USOC, 20
percent of any ACOG surplus would have gone to a foundation to
benefit athletics for youngsters in Atlanta. At one time, ACOG was
forecasting a $150 million surplus; today it maintains there will
be none, although the USOC plans to launch a $1 million Community
Olympic Development Program in Atlanta that would provide seed
money for some Olympic-type sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   During the six-year buildup to the Atlanta Games, ACOG's books
were monitored by the state's Olympic watchdog authority, known as
MAOGA. That check and balance ceased in June 1996, and there is no
longer independent financial oversight to let the public know what
is happening with ACOG's millions.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors last met in the summer of 1997 to review
ACOG'S last independent financial audit and approve a dissolution
plan. The plan authorized the committee's officers _ President
Billy Payne, Chief Operating Officer A.D. Frazier Jr. and managing
directors Ginger Watkins and Patrick Glisson _ to ``wind up and
liquidate ACOG's business and affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no communication since then with the board,
leading some directors to the conclusion that ACOG had dissolved.
``Since the Games, I've had no contact with anybody regarding ACOG,
which I assumed was either out of business or effectively going out
of business,'' said former Gov. Carl Sanders, a board member.
``This is news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of accountability, Glisson, the former chief
financial officer, said the public can rest easy. The USOC reviews
ACOG's books quarterly and annual returns are filed with the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal concern is we get the amount they are carrying
as a contingent liability,'' said John Samuelson, the USOC's chief
financial officer. ``But we're not counting on the money until we
have it in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG had released quarterly financial updates before the Games,
even though the committee maintained it was a private organization
and under no legal obligation to share its finances. Its officials
had hoped to complete their business out of the spotlight. Stogner
now is hesitant to talk about how much money ACOG is sitting on for
fear new litigants will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But with mounting public pressure on Olympic organizations
worldwide to open their books, ACOG officials might have difficulty
doling out their remaining millions with only themselves and the
USOC to answer to. Stewart Acuff, president of the Atlanta Labor
Council who served on the ACOG board audit committee, said of the
organization's activities: ``What I saw was as transparent and
clean as can be.'' Yet, he added, ``I do think it is important for
Atlanta's Olympic legacy and the legacy for the leadership of ACOG
to have a final accounting of where the money went.''
</P>
<P>
   Glisson said he expects the board to receive ``courtesy
information'' once business is concluded. ACOG's federal tax
returns for 1997 _ the most recent financial information available
_ provide a partial accounting of where the money went.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG spent more than $38 million in 1997, mostly to finish
converting the Olympic stadium to baseball and demolishing
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. And though operating with a skeleton
staff, the committee paid its officers and employees more than $5
million and its King &AMP; Spalding lawyers more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, ACOG gave several million dollars to the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, the nonprofit organization created by
Payne in 1987 to bid for the Games and foster amateur sports in
Georgia. The two organizations, both headed by Payne, are closely
aligned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, ACOG transferred ownership of its archives and Olympic
memorabilia to the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation and gave it
a check for $1.15 million, presumably for storage and archiving
expenses. ACOG gave GAAF an additional $1.3 million, which tax
records indicate was repayment of a loan from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Once GAAF received the money from ACOG, the suddenly flush
foundation gave Payne $975,000 for his personal memorabilia
collection. Before its windfall from ACOG, the foundation had less
than $7,000 on hand. The Payne transaction, purposely conducted out
of the public eye, has raised questions about how ACOG is spending
its cash reserves. Indeed, the USOC's Samuelson said he was not
aware of the payment to GAAF even though he is monitoring ACOG's
money.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Games, Payne and ACOG board co-chairman Bob
Holder announced there would be no money available for bonuses for
ACOG officers.
</P>
<P>
   However, they didn't tell the public or the board about a $1
million ``extended resource availability program,'' which provided
a way to funnel money to 25 key employees after the Games. Glisson
said he created the program to ``ensure the people we needed were
available for the critical period of the shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Glisson said seven managing directors, including himself, were
in the program. Some people were paid as much as half a year's
salary to be on call, he said. ``In contrast to a bonus, this was a
very appropriate, rational business decision,'' Glisson said.
</P>
<P>
   Glisson, for example, was paid $410,811 in 1997, although he had
taken a full-time position as chief financial officer at The Emory
Clinic in September.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Frazier were not included in the program. ``I
recognized that would be impolitic,'' Glisson said. ``They were
specifically exempted because that could be misperceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both officers were handsomely compensated the year of the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was paid $806,608 in 1996, a 41 percent increase from
the year before, according to ACOG's tax returns. He received
nothing in 1997, having taken a job as president and chief
executive of Invesco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Payne received a 17 percent raise to $766,833 in 1996 and
another $69,000 in 1997, although he had gone to work as a vice
chairman of NationsBank in February. Later that year, he received
the payment from GAAF for his memorabilia. All told, in the final
two years of Payne's reign as Atlanta's Olympic chief, he took in
$1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very surprising,'' said Coleman. ``There have been a
lot of expenditures of money that would have been appropriate for
the board to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Massell, a former Atlanta mayor, said he expects
ACOG to give the public a final accounting. ``I think it would be
improper to keep anything confidential as matters are brought to a
close,'' he said. ``But I do not fault the team for keeping records
close to the vest for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just so proud of what they achieved ...

   IQALUIT, Nunavut _ Part of Paul Okalik's story strikes a sad and
familiar note here in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young Eskimos, he had no real sense of hope about his
future when he was growing up in Pangnirtung, the next community
north of here. After his older brother Norman killed himself rather
than be sent back to jail, he started drinking. When he was 17,
Paul Okalik, too, was arrested and thrown in jail for three months.
He was going nowhere, and knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has lived in the north knows stories like that. But
another part of his life is unlike anything anyone here has ever
seen. His strong-willed mother, and an elderly grandmother,
persuaded him to go back to school and get a job. Eventually, he
went on to law school, and when he was called to the bar this year
he took his oath in Inuktituk, the language of the Inuit.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few days after becoming the north's first Inuit lawyer,
he was selected the first Premier of the new territory of Nunavut,
which came into being Thursday in Canada's vast eastern Arctic.
Okalik immediately became a symbol of all the hopes and
shortcomings of the bold experiment in self-determination that
Nunavut represents:
</P>
<P>
   _ At 34, he is the youngest premier of any province or territory
in Canada; Nunavut has the youngest population of any territory or
province, and with that, high rates of unemployment and youth
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Except for the election in February in which he won a seat in
the territorial parliament, he has no political experience; Nunavut
also is starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many consider Okalik's newness to be both his greatest
strength and most troubling weakness; likewise, Nunavut can either
forge a new path or head into disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of southern Canadians who see Nunavut as a
well-intentioned but doomed effort, a territory born with almost
total reliance on federal money and lacking the experience and
skills to be run efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Okalik said he knows that many people are waiting for him, and
for Nunavut, to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't matter,'' he said in an interview in his
temporary office in Iqaluit, the capital city of Nunavut. Wearing a
sealskin vest over a casual shirt and jeans, he spoke modestly
about the obstacles he has overcome. ``Inuit are used to those
kinds of comments, and we don't mind. We like to prove everyone
wrong whenever we can.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Eskimos of Canada's desolate north demanded
the chance to govern themselves. Through stubborn negotiations over
many years, in which Okalik played a major role, the Eskimos
managed to win a double victory that is now being watched by other
native groups all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit won the largest land claim in Canada's history,
gaining the right to some 770,000 square miles of tundra, ice and
frozen islands. At the same time, they persuaded the federal
government to split the Northwest Territories to create Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   While the new territory is not strictly limited to Eskimos, or
Inuit as they prefer to be called, it effectively is Inuit
territory since 85 percent of the 27,000 residents are Inuit.
</P>
<P>
   Okalik conceded that the time could come when Inuit are no
longer the majority and a non-Inuit could be elected Premier.
``That would be up to the people,'' he said. ``We're a democracy
like anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Okalik was not expected to become Nunavut's first premier. The
odds-on favorite had been Jack Anawak, a former federal member of
Parliament who also had been the interim commissioner of Nunavut
during two years of preparation for the handover April 1.
</P>
<P>
   After the 19 members of Nunavut's first legislature were
elected, they were to select one from among themselves to be
leader, or premier. Anawak was in trouble. He had won his own seat
in the new legislature by only 13 votes. Some legislators were
disillusioned by his performance as interim commissioner. They
turned against him, and the old order he represented. Looking for a
new start, they picked Okalik.
</P>
<P>
   That turn of events may leave some tensions within the new
government. When Okalik was given a standing ovation at a recent
ceremony, Anawak rose only briefly and was among the first to take
his seat again.
</P>
<P>
   Okalik's odyssey through the alcoholism and despair that have
ruined so many Inuit lives has clearly earned him the community's
respect. And it is clear that what he accomplished, he did in the
Inuit way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not very aggressive,'' said Anne Crawford, a lawyer in
Iqaluit with whom Okalik clerked for a year. ``He didn't
necessarily want to win. He wanted things to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Those could turn out to be handy skills in the nonpartisan,
consensus government that has been adopted by Nunavut. But Okalik's
inexperience worries many people. And it did not help when he
appointed Mrs. Crawford to the powerful position of secretary to
the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that, Okalik told reporters that she was simply
the best qualified person for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations here are high, and some degree of letdown is
inevitable once the celebrations end. Okalik is focusing on
developing economic opportunities for Nunavut's people, perhaps
through fighting for an end to the U.S. ban on the import of
sealskin like the vest he wears.
</P>
<P>
   But for a man who knows what it is like to live without hope,
opening a strong future for his people is most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we can introduce high standards for future
governments,'' Okalik said, ``and improve our situation in Nunavut
so that this will be remembered as a point in time when things
changed for the better.''

 &HT;    ACOG account: Millions still left to spend
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The last time the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games reported publicly on its finances, it said there would be
nothing left for local youth sports programs after a huge debt was
paid off to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost two years ago, when the committee still had $65
million in the bank. Since then, tens of millions have changed
hands among ACOG, its top officers, its stadium construction team,
its lawyers and the tiny Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation.
Nearly $11 million remains in its account.
</P>
<P>
   Among those surprised to learn ACOG has not closed its books and
continues to write checks are some of its own board of directors.
``I find that to be truly astonishing,'' attorney Michael Coleman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not still on the board, am I?'' asked Sam Massell,
president of the Buckhead (Business) Coalition. ``I thought they
closed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG officials said the committee will wind down this summer
when all accounts are settled, including a few legal disputes over
such matters as private property rights and a missing painting.
They intend to use any leftover funds to pay off a $22 million loan
from the USOC in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stogner, the financial director who still works part
time in ACOG's small office at the Inforum, said about half the
debt has been repaid and he hopes to use any remaining funds in
ACOG's account to eliminate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave youth sports out in the cold. Under an early
agreement with the International Olympic Committee and the USOC, 20
percent of any ACOG surplus would have gone to a foundation to
benefit athletics for youngsters in Atlanta. At one time, ACOG was
forecasting a $150 million surplus; today it maintains there will
be none, although the USOC plans to launch a $1 million Community
Olympic Development Program in Atlanta that would provide seed
money for some Olympic-type sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   During the six-year buildup to the Atlanta Games, ACOG's books
were monitored by the state's Olympic watchdog authority, known as
MAOGA. That check and balance ceased in June 1996, and there is no
longer independent financial oversight to let the public know what
is happening with ACOG's millions.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors last met in the summer of 1997 to review
ACOG'S last independent financial audit and approve a dissolution
plan. The plan authorized the committee's officers _ President
Billy Payne, Chief Operating Officer A.D. Frazier Jr. and managing
directors Ginger Watkins and Patrick Glisson _ to ``wind up and
liquidate ACOG's business and affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no communication since then with the board,
leading some directors to the conclusion that ACOG had dissolved.
``Since the Games, I've had no contact with anybody regarding ACOG,
which I assumed was either out of business or effectively going out
of business,'' said former Gov. Carl Sanders, a board member.
``This is news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of accountability, Glisson, the former chief
financial officer, said the public can rest easy. The USOC reviews
ACOG's books quarterly and annual returns are filed with the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our principal concern is we get the amount they are carrying
as a contingent liability,'' said John Samuelson, the USOC's chief
financial officer. ``But we're not counting on the money until we
have it in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ACOG had released quarterly financial updates before the Games,
even though the committee maintained it was a private organization
and under no legal obligation to share its finances. Its officials
had hoped to complete their business out of the spotlight. Stogner
now is hesitant to talk about how much money ACOG is sitting on for
fear new litigants will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   But with mounting public pressure on Olympic organizations
worldwide to open their books, ACOG officials might have difficulty
doling out their remaining millions with only themselves and the
USOC to answer to. Stewart Acuff, president of the Atlanta Labor
Council who served on the ACOG board audit committee, said of the
organization's activities: ``What I saw was as transparent and
clean as can be.'' Yet, he added, ``I do think it is important for
Atlanta's Olympic legacy and the legacy for the leadership of ACOG
to have a final accounting of where the money went.''
</P>
<P>
   Glisson said he expects the board to receive ``courtesy
information'' once business is concluded. ACOG's federal tax
returns for 1997 _ the most recent financial information available
_ provide a partial accounting of where the money went.
</P>
<P>
   ACOG spent more than $38 million in 1997, mostly to finish
converting the Olympic stadium to baseball and demolishing
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. And though operating with a skeleton
staff, the committee paid its officers and employees more than $5
million and its King &AMP; Spalding lawyers more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also that year, ACOG gave several million dollars to the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, the nonprofit organization created by
Payne in 1987 to bid for the Games and foster amateur sports in
Georgia. The two organizations, both headed by Payne, are closely
aligned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, ACOG transferred ownership of its archives and Olympic
memorabilia to the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation and gave it
a check for $1.15 million, presumably for storage and archiving
expenses. ACOG gave GAAF an additional $1.3 million, which tax
records indicate was repayment of a loan from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Once GAAF received the money from ACOG, the suddenly flush
foundation gave Payne $975,000 for his personal memorabilia
collection. Before its windfall from ACOG, the foundation had less
than $7,000 on hand. The Payne transaction, purposely conducted out
of the public eye, has raised questions about how ACOG is spending
its cash reserves. Indeed, the USOC's Samuelson said he was not
aware of the payment to GAAF even though he is monitoring ACOG's
money.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Games, Payne and ACOG board co-chairman Bob
Holder announced there would be no money available for bonuses for
ACOG officers.
</P>
<P>
   However, they didn't tell the public or the board about a $1
million ``extended resource availability program,'' which provided
a way to funnel money to 25 key employees after the Games. Glisson
said he created the program to ``ensure the people we needed were

</P>

salary to be on call, he said. ``In contrast to a bonus, this was a
very appropriate, rational business decision,'' Glisson said.
</P>
<P>
   Glisson, for example, was paid $410,811 in 1997, although he had
taken a full-time position as chief financial officer at The Emory
Clinic in September.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Frazier were not included in the program. ``I
recognized that would be impolitic,'' Glisson said. ``They were
specifically exempted because that could be misperceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both officers were handsomely compensated the year of the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was paid $806,608 in 1996, a 41 percent increase from
the year before, according to ACOG's tax returns. He received
nothing in 1997, having taken a job as president and chief
executive of Invesco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Payne received a 17 percent raise to $766,833 in 1996 and
another $69,000 in 1997, although he had gone to work as a vice
chairman of NationsBank in February. Later that year, he received
the payment from GAAF for his memorabilia. All told, in the final
two years of Payne's reign as Atlanta's Olympic chief, he took in
$1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very surprising,'' said Coleman. ``There have been a
lot of expenditures of money that would have been appropriate for
the board to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Board member Massell, a former Atlanta mayor, said he expects
ACOG to give the public a final accounting. ``I think it would be

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Since the Cold War ended, no other event has so divided
the West and Russia as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The chasm is
so deep that even words have taken on opposite meanings. While
Americans and Europeans talk about the ``genocide'' of Kosovo
Albanians by Serbs, many Russians talk about the ``genocide'' of
Serbs by U.S. bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the chief villains are President Clinton and NATO,
variously described as fascists and bullies. Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, widely identified in the United States and
Europe as the man responsible for a vicious campaign of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' is seen by many here as a defiant patriot, defending
the sovereignty of a country attacked by foreign aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the different perceptions stem from a stark
contrast in images. While Americans and Europeans watch in horror
as Albanian refugees describe being hounded out of their homes by
Serbian gunmen, Russians listen to Serbs tell of houses, bridges
and factories destroyed in the latest bombing raid. Albanian
refugees are occasionally shown on Russian television but usually
they are seen as the victims of a widening war, not of an organized
effort to push them out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Watching French television in his hotel room during a trip to
France, Vladimir Kustikov, news director for NTV, Russia's main
independent television station, was struck by the difference.
``There they made a clear emphasis on the suffering of the Albanian
refugees,'' he said. ``It was a clear accent that I guess is
somehow connected to the market demands in the West, and some
political pressures that are not visible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same in my country,'' he said. ``We are serving our
Russian market, and our Russian market is more interested in the
fate of the Serbs, in part because of the psychological closeness
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cold War were still on and Soviet information controls
still in place, these differences in perception could be written
off to propaganda. But the global competition between Washington
and Moscow ended at least eight years ago, and the Russian media,
like the U.S. media, is more or less free to choose its focus.
</P>
<P>
   There are Russian newspapers and television channels that strain
for objectivity. Major newspapers have published articles blaming
Milosevic for the human tragedy in Kosovo, and criticizing Russian
foreign policy makers for supporting him. An NTV news team on the
border of Kosovo has conducted interviews with ethnic Albanian
refugees, describing their forced evictions, but the emphasis is
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``This huge flow of refugees is very striking, and it shows that
the situation is horrible,'' said Kustikov, who had to pull
Russia's only television crew in Kosovo out of the Serbian province
after it was caught in cross-fire that killed their driver, and
destroyed their cameras. ``But the reasons are mixed. On the one
hand, it is the Serbian brutal policy towards the Kosovars. On the
other hand, the bombardment intensified this evil process, and
people are afraid _ of bombardments and of Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Russian government officials haven't done their best to
steer public opinion behind a policy that has consistently attacked
the NATO bombing as an act of brutal international aggression. The
picture of the Yugoslav conflict painted at regular briefings at
the Russian Foreign Ministry is of Western support for a criminal
gang of drug-running Albanian terrorists, who have challenged the
territorial integrity of a historic Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the political perspective can even be measured
by facts: according to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Kosovo
Albanians made up 60 percent of the population of Kosovo before the
bombings began _ not 90 percent, as Western analysts say. Ivanov
has also claimed that civilian casualties in the province numbered
300 over the last year _ compared to a figure of 1,818 from the
United Nations refugee agency, which includes 200 soldiers with the
Kosovo Liberation Army and 139 members of Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russian reporters on the ground in Belgrade have attempted _ so
far in vain _ to confirm Moscow's claims of more than 1,000
civilian casualties in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out fact from propaganda is not a problem just in
Moscow. Reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels have also had
trouble with official statements, in particular with reports beamed
around the world about the murder of top Kosovo Albanian political
figures that NATO later said were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   At Sovietskaya Rossiya, the newspaper of Russia's Communist
opposition, Valentin Chikhin is openly skeptical about the Western
media's emphasis on the plight of the Albanian refugees. ``The
people in Kosovo are leaving because they are being bombed,'' he
said. ``People are afraid that a war will start there tomorrow;
they are afraid of an all-out ground war.'' In his mind, the West's
skewered reporting fits into a pattern of anti-Serb propaganda
dating to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and before.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chikhin, the reaction from his readers has been a
ground swell of anti-American sentiments that is continuing to
escalate. Western diplomats put some of the blame for the firing up
of anti-Western views on official statements that have been
remarkable for their tough Cold War rhetoric. ``The government has
a lot to do with how these emotions are playing themselves out,''
said one senior diplomat. ``What I would hope is that the
government does not inflame these emotions, and remains mindful of
their impact on the pursuit of a normal diplomatic relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Russian officials have been surprised by the gulf that
is opening between Russia and the West over Yugoslavia. A Russian
diplomat who asked not to be identified said this was not due so
much to media or politicians. ``When the bombs started falling on
Serbia,'' he said, ``many Russians felt as though the bombs were
falling on their land. You can't call this a good thing, even if
you don't consider Milosevic to be the savior of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded that the emotional response to the bombardment had
less to do with feelings of brotherhood with Orthodox Slavs than
with Russians' own resentment at being dictated to by the West.

 &HT;    Life goes on _ at a fast clip _ for ex-NBAF chief
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dwight Andrews is on the upswing. Since the new year,
when his two-year contract with the National Black Arts Festival
expired, it has taken one less hyphen to accommodate the Atlanta
composer-educator-minister-scholar's professional activities.
</P>
<P>
   As artistic director of the NBAF, the sprawling biannual
festival that celebrates African-American arts and artists, Andrews
faced steep challenges, most in terms of digging the decade-old
event out of debt. He succeeded once, retiring a $377,000 deficit
left from the 1996 festival.
</P>
<P>
   But when the NBAF came up short after last summer _ as much as
$700,000 short _ Andrews saw only one logical move. He made his
exit. And he's not looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with the choices I've made,'' says Andrews, 46,
a professor of music at Emory University and an ordained minister
affiliated with downtown's First Congregational Church. ``I'm
feeling creatively energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Those energies are pouring in several directions, business as
usual for Andrews. The past few months have seen him compose music
for ``Everybody's Ruby,'' the off-Broadway collaboration between
playwright Thulani Davis and director Kenny Leon; gig at New York's
Village Vanguard and the San Francisco Jazz Festival; host an
ongoing series of improvised music at his church; continue work on
``Woman at the Well,'' a music-theater piece that Jomandi
Productions will give a workshop production in May. And he bounced
back from a knockout bout with pneumonia. ``I did some good
reflecting,'' he says of his illness, which sidelined him for a
month last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast one recent morning, Andrews shared some of the
things he's been thinking about, from his brief NBAF tenure to his
rekindled desire to play live jazz:
</P>
<P>
   _ On his NBAF departure: ``I think the festival went very well.
I think it broke some new ground. I'm very proud of what we did.
... But they will have to reorganize so that the person who asks
for the money is also responsible for how the money is spent. The
other issue, and really the bigger issue for me, is I didn't really
envision spending the next two years, going into the new
millennium, being a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the arts as a spiritual pursuit: ``The one thing that's
good about First Congregational Church is there are a lot of things
that I can do, not just spiritually focused, but things that are
culturally and artistically focused, without the tremendous
administrative encumbrances of a big festival. I'm envisioning a
real heavy focus on the culture and arts and a very ecumenical
environment for poets and playwrights and actors. Especially for
artists who could use a place to explore their spiritual side and
maybe even think about how that speaks to the art they are
creating. It's always been a part of my ministry, but if the church
is willing to make a long-term commitment, I would envision a
lecture series and different kinds of dialogues, as well as
performances and panels and literally every week something
happening there. It would be like my own nightclub, a spiritual
nightclub.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On making music: ``I've got a new soprano sax, and I'm just
shedding (practicing), giving myself eight months of serious daily
work. Two hours a day, that's the most I can muster. I'm going to
actually try to do some kind of recording project.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On the collapse of the Arts Festival of Atlanta and the NBAF's
struggles: ``I think (the fact) that the festivals are struggling
has to do with a much bigger issue. The two festivals are very,
very different. The Arts Festival was really struggling with
different visions of what it should be. The board wanted to keep it
more locally rooted or regionally rooted, and the artistic
leadership saw it as having a much more national visibility, a
bigger nut. I mean when you have Philip Glass and these cats from
Paris coming and dancing, that's a whole different thing. You have
to build an audience toward that. You don't just pay the big bucks
and say: `If you bring them, they will come.' Because the people
might come, but the corporations might not. Sponsors still are in
the process of their own, being educated about the arts, and they
probably aren't nearly as learned as they think they are. And why
they sponsor stuff is very different from why artists and artistic
groups present it. They sleep in the same bed, but there's a pillow
in between them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On corporate sponsorship of jumbo-size arts events: ``The
culture is changing in the way big art events are perceived.
Corporate sponsors are still incredibly silly in the way they go
about deciding whether to sponsor you. They'll ask, `Who are you
going to have?' `Well, how much money can you give us?' `Well,
we'll tell you how much when you tell us who you're going to have.'
`Well, we'll have Denzel Washington.' `Oh good, let's have Denzel,
because we know we can put him in Ebony magazine.' `Well what's he
going to do?' `It doesn't matter, just get Denzel.' But then you
say, `I want to hire (Nigerian writer) Chinua Achebe to have him do
(a theatrical version of his classic novel) ``Things Fall Apart.'''
And they say, `What?' So there's a gulf between the real money
sponsorships and their sincerity. It's a plantation system. But
interestingly enough, the musicians and artists I know are forging
ahead on their own. They're using technology and finding new ways
to create opportunities. I'm really excited about what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Parting words: ``What the NBAF experience showed me was that
the great art will go on with or without me and the festival. On my
tombstone I don't want it to say, `Artistic Director of the
National Black Arts Festival.' I want it to say: `This cat made
some music,' or `Spirit and arts were the thing.' Something like
that.

(DW) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain spent more than five years as a
prisoner of war in Vietnam and learned, he says, the dangers of
limited measures. He is now a forceful advocate of all-out
intervention in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Almost ubiquitous on television news shows, McCain, R-Ariz.,
steadily makes the case from which President Clinton shies away _
that America can no longer afford to rule out the use of ground
troops in Kosovo. He maintains that the United States, having begun
the air campaign, must preserve its credibility by beating back the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pyongyang and Baghdad and Tripoli, they are paying close
attention,'' he said in an interview on Friday. ``And if a military
establishment that was defeated by the Croatian army prevails, one
led by a Balkan thug prevails, then we will be vulnerable to many
challenges in many places.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a candidate for president, and the confluence of the
early campaign season and the air attacks has set him apart in the
field, highlighting his expertise in military affairs and his war
record.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, supports an air campaign
but not ground troops. Elizabeth Hanford Dole said Friday that the
United States should not rule out ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 62, a former Navy pilot, had long planned to announce
his candidacy formally next week, but he canceled the political
event, calling it inappropriate to campaign while the nation is at
war. The step has only seemed to increase his appeal: he appeared
on the morning shows of the three major television networks on
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He is unapologetic about taking advantage of the platform.
``I've been asked for my view and I've given it because I think
that this situation we're in is of transcendent importance,'' he
said. In a dig at Clinton, he added: ``We're not talking about
school uniforms. We're talking about the most important aspect of
our role in government _ national security.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, despite the criticisms of the president, the
White House welcomes another voice arguing for resolve as it tries
to muster support for the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree on the utility of ground troops but that is an
honest policy disagreement,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary. ``I think Sen. McCain has been quite effective in
making the case for U.S. and NATO involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long been critical of Clinton's foreign policy, and a
speech he delivered in the Senate on the eve of the NATO air
strikes now sounds prescient.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the administration of not following through on threats
to Milosevic, he said, ``Our threats of force have apparently lost
their power to restrain the remorseless and bloodthirsty Serbian
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to warn the Senate that it would be
``extraordinarily dangerous'' for it to undercut the president on
the eve of air strikes. ``Our adversaries around the globe will
take heart from our inability to act in concert,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have argued that committing troops to Kosovo
would result in a Vietnam-like quagmire. But McCain said the lesson
he drew from the war in which he served was, ``You don't get into a
conflict unless you are willing to exercise all means necessary to
winning it.''
</P>
<P>
   His stand may seem politically risky _ Americans do not favor
ground troops. But political strategists say that such positions
are part of McCain's appeal and that as a long-shot candidate what
he most needs to do is stand out from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes McCain will self-deprecatingly mock his own war
record. At a recent Washington dinner featuring skits by reporters,
he walked to a lectern, overloaded with war ribbons, and joked
about his time as a prisoner of war and his quixotic attempts to
ban the unregulated contributions to political parties known as
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was lying there in my prison cell in Hanoi having my legs
broken by interrogators, one thought and one thought alone kept me
going,'' he said to laughs from the crowd, ``that some day I would
come home and do some thing about soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that the capture of three Americans by the
Serbs this week left him anguished. ``It did bring back a few
memories of when I was first captured,'' he said, ``which I rarely
ever think about.''

PLAN FOR U.S. FUNDS TO ARM KOSOVAR REBELS WORRIES NATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia so far
unable to deter the atrocities in Kosovo, and the United States
unwilling to commit ground troops, the idea of arming the Kosovo
guerrillas has garnered support from a number of politicians and
former policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army offers ``a credible, capable and
willing alternative to the deployment of Americans,'' Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., have proposed
spending $25 million to arm the Kosovo rebels. Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., was among the first to raise the idea of arming the Kosovo
guerrillas, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was national security
adviser to President Jimmy Carter, has expressed support for such a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration and its NATO partners are
resolutely against the idea. They view Kosovo's Albanian rebels
with considerable wariness, if not alarm, because of their
political ideologies and questionable commitment to democracy. Some
in the rebel movement are considered hard-line Marxists, others
Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   In March, month, Albanian officials alerted the Clinton
administration that Iran was sending weapons to the Kosovo rebels,
through Albania. As many as four flights with weapons from Iran may
have reached the rebels, according to documents and a person
involved in arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were to arm the Kosovo Liberation Army, it
would ``provide a platform'' for Islamic fundamentalists from Iran,
Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, said one U.S. official. In
each of those nations, volunteers and weapons are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is that Russia could see a U.S. operation to arm
the rebels as further justification to provide weapons to Serbia,
according to U.S. and European diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they crazy?'' said a stunned diplomat at the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe when she first heard of the
proposal by McConnell and Lieberman to arm the Kosovo rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official who has met frequently with the Kosovar
guerrilla leaders over the years described them as rigid
communists. ``They draw their cultural and political philosophy
from Enver Hoxha,'' he said. Hoxha, a hard-line communist who
considered the Soviet Union and even China under Mao as too soft,
ruled Albania for more than 40 years until his death in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell said the character and ideology of the Kosovo
Liberation Army was beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have to do a background check any more than
we did on the Contras,'' McConnell said, referring to the rebel
army that was trained and equipped by the Reagan administration to
topple the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt there may be some bad actors'' among the
Kosovo rebels, he said in a telephone interview from Australia.
``But the point is,'' he continued, ``who else is on the ground
willing to fight the ethnic cleansing?''
</P>
<P>
   The political roots of the Kosovo Liberation Army go back to the
early 1980s, when the Popular Movement for Kosovo called for an
armed uprising in favor of Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia.
Another political party, the Democratic League of Kosovo, advocated
a policy of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the advocates of
nonviolence, headed by Ibrahim Rugova, enjoyed the backing of most
Albanians in Kosovo, where they formed 90 percent of the population
of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But as Slobodan Milosevic grew more repressive, the patience of
Kosovo's Albanians _ particularly of the young people _ waned. Then
came the disintegration of Albania, in the spring of 1997. In the
near-anarchy that followed, arms depots were looted, and suddenly
half a million Kalashnikov assault rifles were on the market, so
many that the price plummeted to $15 for one of the best assault
rifles ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's guerrillas also bought weapons in the popular arms
bazaars for rebel groups around the world these days, like Ukraine
and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more contentious issues is how much of the rebels'
money comes from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take it for granted that the KLA benefits from heroin
trafficking,'' said Rens Lee, an expert on the international arms
trade.
</P>
<P>
   That has been widely reported in European newspapers, and
European officials say that Albania has become a major hub for the
movement of heroin and cocaine into Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The links between organized criminal groups engaged in the drug
trade and the Kosovo Liberation Army are harder to establish,
though.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said last week that the United States
does not have evidence that as an organization the Kosovo
Liberation Army is raising money through the drug trade. A senior
European diplomat from a country greatly concerned about the drugs
coming out of Albania agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But both men said it was undoubtedly true that some supporters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army were drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of the money that came to the rebel army was from
the Albanian diaspora, mostly in Europe, as well as fund-raisers
from London to New York.
</P>
<P>
   While the guerrilla force mushroomed rapidly from a ragtag band
to a more disciplined, better-armed and organized rebel group over
the last year, the guerrillas had neither the time nor the money to
build a truly effective military arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a relatively insignificant military force,'' a senior
U.S. military commander in Europe said last month, a few weeks
before the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas numbered about 6,000 men, armed primarily with
assault rifles and small mortars, he said, adding that they had
virtually no heavy weapons and poor communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, therefore, that the rebels have been badly
routed by the Serbian police and Yugoslav army in the last two
weeks. American officials now say the KLA is all but vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are expected to regroup in Albania, U.S. officials
said, and their supporters are expected to begin a campaign in the
United States and Europe for military support.
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said that the most troubling thing about the
Kosovo rebels was that it was not clear what they stood for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what they are,'' he said. ``There is an
Islamic component, a left-wing component, and there are those who
are just guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Of late, he said, they have been united by a common enemy _
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   If they were victorious, they might start fighting among
themselves again _ a repeated pattern of revolutionaries throughout
history _ and there is little hope that they would establish a
democracy. ``They have no democratic experience,'' the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another European diplomat put it this way: ``They are not a
people we would feel comfortable getting too close to. It is not
like they are the military wing of a democratic resistance
movement.''

   KUKES, Albania _ The stark evidence of the failure of NATO air
raids to prevent Serbian forces from driving hundreds of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo is in the haunted eyes of almost
300,000 who have already been driven out, and in their unconfirmed,
but uniform tales of horror.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer enormity of the Serbian drive recalls both the spring
and the summer of 1992 in Bosnia, when an estimated 750,000
Bosnians were driven from their homes, and Balkan wars stretching
back to the 1870s. In this region of Europe, making policy by
shifting populations has a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia seem to
be keeping to that tradition, stripping Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
of the farms and houses that are their only source of wealth, and
then reportedly taking identity documents, property deeds and car
license plates _ everything that would prove they had lived in the
southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The shattered refugees who have crossed the border here for the
past nine days have told of Serbian forces rampaging through the
countryside looting, pillaging, burning and killing at will and,
finally, hounding the Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a calculated program of ``massive ethnic cleansing,'' a
NATO spokesman, Sir David Wilby, said at a briefing in Brussels,
Belgium, on Saturday, ``manufactured in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO says this forced exodus from Kosovo is rapidly turning into
the biggest population movement in Europe since World War II. A
NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, estimated on Saturday that Kosovo could
be cleared of its entire ethnic Albanian population in 10 to 20
days if the current pace at which refugees are arriving keeps up.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more refugees poured over the border here on Friday
night in the rain, spending the night on windswept hillsides with
no shelter other than plastic sheets over their farm carts. This
little town in northern Albania has been swamped with refugees, its
cracked streets filled and what little infrastructure there is
overwhelmed. Water supplies shut off and in the grimy hospital on
the edge of town doctors were pulling shrapnel from refugee
patients without anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the long, dejected lines of refugees, people tell almost
identical stories _ differing only in time and place _ of the
arrival of armed men, from the special Interior Ministry police,
the Yugoslav army, or private, ultranationalist paramilitary
militias like the ``Tigers,'' run by the warlord Zeljko
Raznjatovic, better known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   Straggling over the border in the last two days have been clumps
of people _ almost all women, children and a few old men _ from the
region around Malisevo who say they have been on the run for days,
hiding in the mountains and woods and under shellfire from tanks,
mortars and Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kind of widely dispersed, small-unit tactics that
could only be countered by opposing ground troops. To date,
President Clinton and other NATO leaders have said they would not
send ground troops into Kosovo to fight, although NATO planners and
senior administration officials have suggested that allied forces
may go into the province to create what they term a protectorate _
essentially a guarded enclave to which Kosovo's Albanians could
return, under NATO protection.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Serbian strategy of driving the ethnic Albanians out without
documents not only makes it difficult for them to prove that they
ever lived there, but also for them to be integrated into the more
regulated societies of other European countries, if they cannot or
will not eventually return home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they have no money. This is a part of the world
where accumulated wealth is traditionally not kept in banks or
other investments, but is put primarily into building and improving
one's home and furnishing it with material possessions. Thus, by
burning the houses, the Serbs are wiping out everything the ethnic
Albanians have accumulated over generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years of work, from the father to the son, and now
everything is gone,'' said Osman Osman, 44.
</P>
<P>
   If the hometowns and villages _ mostly now burned _ of the
arriving refugees are traced on a map, a clear pattern emerges of
the population being systematically swept from whole regions.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, the first refugees were mainly from around the
nearest city of Prizren, which lies on a main highway running
through the border, and then from around Dakovica, on a secondary
road to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Next, people from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, arrived,
saying that they were pulled from their homes, marched between
lines of masked gunmen, held overnight in a railroad station and
then bused en masse to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees arriving now, villagers, are from more
outlying areas like Dragas, a pocket to the southeast, or around
Malisevo to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The first refugees had several hours or overnight to gather a
few belongings. For the past several days, the refugees have been
carrying only a blanket or a few clothes in a plastic bag. Many are
on foot and have not had food or water for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers at the border say that they are now seeing more sick
and wounded people, partly because they have been on the road
longer and are suffering from exposure and exhaustion, or are
coming from areas that have been under shellfire.

DISTANCE LEARNING: ONLINE STUDY PROGRAMS BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM

<TEXT>
<P>
   With his silver hair, V-neck sweater over a crisp Oxford shirt,
genteel European accent and background as a conductor with
orchestras from Israel to Boston, Dr. David Sonnenschein is no
one's idea of a technogeek.
</P>
<P>
   But after 25 years of teaching music at Northeastern University,
Dr. Sonnenschein finds himself happily in the thick of things on
the digital frontier. Students who sign up for his Music 1101 _
``Music: A Listening Experience'' _ agree to study Mozart's minuets
and Beethoven's symphonies entirely via computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein describes his course as a ``stand-alone,
self-paced, computer-mediated, interactive multimedia program''
designed to introduce nonmusicians to classical music. Students
listen to recorded music, read text, follow programmed ``listening
experiences,'' take tests and communicate with him by computer.
When they study rondos or sonatas, for example, they listen to the
music on their computers and try to match it to the technical forms
shown on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about technology, it's about learning how to
listen and how to understand what you're listening to,''
Sonnenschein said as he waited for his Power Mac to boot up in his
office overlooking Centennial Circle on Northeastern's campus. ``I
can lecture on musical forms, but to many of them I might as well
be speaking Chinese. But when they learn at their own pace, they
can listen over and over again until the aha! happens _ until they
get it on their own. I took the technology up late, but I'm happy I
did. It's a very effective way to teach this course.''
</P>
<P>
   A 70-year-old conductor and composer teaching Mozart through
computer programs and the Internet to students who could just as
well show up in class is not the stereotype of online education.
But at a pace far exceeding what most people expected, online
education is becoming a defiantly mainstream academic experience.
</P>
<P>
   It is setting in motion an academic gold rush that is making
universities think more like Amazon.com than Harvard.edu. It is
exciting professors like Sonnenschein, who see it as an innovative
teaching tool, and scaring the mortarboards off many others, who
see the excesses of the marketplace invading the sanctuary of the
academy. It is helping to create a new academic environment in
which entities with names like Anheuser-Busch University, Jones
International University and Western Governors University are
jockeying along with Stanford, Oberlin and the University of
California at Los Angeles for a share of the education market.
</P>
<P>
   While some institutions want only to supplement on-campus
offerings, the goal for many others is true distance learning on a
scale unlike anything before, attracting students around the globe
who will never set foot in a classroom _ if there is a
bricks-and-mortar campus at all. That potential is attracting both
traditional institutions and a wave of new ones, hoping to devise
an entirely different educational model.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some flamboyant predictions, almost no one expects
virtual education to replace the world of ivy-edged campuses.
Courses like Sonnenschein's are certain to proliferate for a
generation of students who are more comfortable with the Internet
than the library. But traditional undergraduate education, where
the social experience is as much a part of the allure as the
educational one, will probably be the least affected, most experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, growth in education is not residential campuses for 18-
to 22-year-olds. Only about 15 percent of college students fall
into that age group and live on campus; 45 percent are older,
nonresidential students, most of whom work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the growth is in M.B.A. programs for middle managers
who cannot take two years off from their job and family;
undergraduate degrees for working mothers; courses for engineers
and computer technicians whose knowledge becomes outmoded every
year, or French Impressionism or religion for boomers who wished
they had paid better attention when they were undergraduates in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows who the most successful players will be. And
there is a raging debate about whether the rise of online education
is a welcome development. But almost everyone in education is
casting glances _ nervous or covetous _ at the online world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great angst out there,'' said Andy DiPaolo, a senior
associate dean at Stanford University's School of Engineering,
whose distance program is a conspicuous early success. ``People are
not sure what this means. Universities are saying, `I think we need
to be in this, but I don't know.' There's been a tradition through
the industrial age of students coming to the campus, and now we're
told that in the communications age, the campus will come to the
students. That's a big challenge to universities who typically
don't think along those lines, but more and more, everyone is
having to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching outside the classroom did not start with the Internet,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started distance education in 1892 _ before there was the
Internet, there was the telegraph,'' said Dr. Jim Ryan, a vice
president for outreach and cooperative extension at Penn State.
``And it's evolved with the technology. First, there was
rural-free-delivery mail, then radio, then television, then a
combination of videotapes and audiotapes, then online education.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Ryan quickly notes, there is no way to compare the old
expectations with the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Penn State calls its online program the World Campus and views
it as an autonomous 25th campus in the university system. In six
months it has grown to 600 students from 70. The numbers should
reach 1,200 in June, and the university and various partners expect
to spend $10 million to $12 million to reach an enrollment of
10,000 students in four years. By then, university officials hope
the program will begin generating revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Amazon.com approach,'' Ryan said. ``You want to
expand your product and position yourself for the marketplace, so
you can be a very large provider of a variety of products. You look
at the range of institutions that are looking into this, and it
boggles the mind. And everyone seems to think there's a four- or
five-year window to really establish yourself, so there's an
enormous amount of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what is most striking about electronic education is how
broad a universe of players is trying to get in on it.
</P>
<P>
   So a reporter's query on the Internet asking to hear from
institutions or individuals serving the online education market
elicits responses from a remarkable array of providers of courses,
software, hardware or information.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio University has its M.B.A. Without Boundaries program. The
AT&AMP;T Foundation is behind a $150 million effort to promote
education via the Internet. Thierry Levy, who runs a company called
Quiz Studio, touts his Web-based training programs, and Bisk
Publishing its courses in business administration, accounting and
computing information systems, which the company offers through
partnerships with various colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   There are responses from familiar names like the University of
Minnesota and from less familiar ones like online corporate
training programs or Jones International University, the first
totally online institution to receive accreditation from one of the
six major regional accreditation organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most publicized Internet programs come from
brand-name schools, Stanford and Duke. Stanford's engineering
program offers 100 courses, taught online to students around the
world at 140 percent of the school's normal tuition. It has drawn
3,000 students since it began in 1997. Duke charges a hefty $85,800
for its Global Executive M.B.A. Program, which has attracted
executives internationally for a 19-month program that mixes
sessions on campus with intensive study online. Tuition includes a
laptop computer, printer, software, CD-ROMs and lodging and meals
at five residential sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But a more typical story may be that of Sheila Kaplan, the
president of Metropolitan State College in Denver, with 17,600
students the largest undergraduate college in the country and the
third largest school in Colorado. Metropolitan State represents the
changing educational marketplace. Students' average age is 27, 80
percent work and many find taking courses at home by way of
computer, in between car pooling or after work, enormously
appealing. When the college began online courses in 1996, it began
with 30 courses and 420 students. This year's enrollment is 2,100
students in 87 courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken off way beyond our expectations,'' Kaplan said.
``Ten years ago, I used to give speeches in which I said the two
parts of the American economy that would never change would be
medical care and higher education. Obviously, medicine has changed
radically, and the computer is going to change education in the
same way. In a few years, the only thing you won't be able to do
online will be to drink beer at a sorority house, date the student
sitting next to you and find a parking space.''
</P>
<P>
   That growth may not be assured. Western Governors University,
the consortium of 17 states plus Guam, opened last fall after years
of hype. It offers degree programs gleaned from various
universities geared to establishing competency in technical and
professional areas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede enrollment has been well below expectations,
saying only that ``hundreds'' of students have enrolled. They won't
release enrollment figures until this fall, when they will
presumably have a better story to tell. The slow start has led some
skeptics to wonder if an online glut is already setting in.
</P>
<P>
   To many, the real question is not whether online education has a
future, but whether it is a positive or a malignant one.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Feenberg, a philosophy professor at San Diego State
University, is qualified to see both sides. In 1981, Feenberg was
part of the team that created what he says was the first online
educational program. Designed for the School of Management and
Strategic Studies at the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute, it
allowed students at their computers to discuss issues like
globalization, environmentalism and urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was primitive _ an Apple IIE with 48K memory and
300-baud modems (multiply by 1,000 and 100 to get the current
versions). Everyone figured out teaching methods and online
protocol as they went along. But years later, Feenberg is still
impressed by the ability of online education to draw people
together and interact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of online discussion surpassed anything I have
been able to simulate in my face-to-face classroom,'' he wrote
recently in a paper on distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen the past, he is now witnessing the future. In the
California State University system, Microsoft, Hughes Aircraft,
Fujitsu and MCI arranged an ambitious plan to spend $300 million on
a fiber-optic network that would connect California State's 22
campuses in exchange for the right to sell a projected $3.8 billion
in high-tech projects over the next decade to students and to
universities. Opposition from students and faculty members killed
the proposal, but plans are being reworked for a different form of
corporate partnership.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several corporate alliances washing over public
education in California. And it leaves Feenberg profoundly uneasy
about where online education is heading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone from what seemed like a rather impractical
scheme of some faculty weirdos and their hangers-on to become
suddenly a big-time push between corporations and administrators to
cut costs,'' he said. ``What I'd like to see is for the faculty to
recover the initiative. Right now, the technology is being billed
as doing the impossible. It's not a way to save a lot of money or
replace faculty, but that's the way it's being sold. Hope is
replacing serious knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, along with the institutional feeding frenzy is a
significant degree of unease on the part of many professors, who
think administrators see online education as a way to cut back on
professors and new construction.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Washington, 900 faculty members signed
petitions opposing state officials' ambitious plans for a virtual
university. ``We feel called upon to respond before quixotic ideas
harden into disastrous policies,'' the petition said. ``Education
is not reducible to the downloading of information, much less to
the passive and solitary activity of staring at a screen.''
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, only 30 percent of faculty members complied last year
with a new requirement that all courses post a syllabus on the
Internet. The American Association of University Professors, which
represents the nation's college professors, says that courses
taught on the Internet require more class time than regular ones
and therefore require more, not fewer, instructors. Professors have
also raised issues about what effect online courses will have on
hiring, whether one-size-fits-all software will replace teachers
and whether technology will undermine the relationships at the
heart of education.
</P>
<P>
   All universities are also struggling with issues of intellectual
property rights _ does the university or the professor own the
courses marketed online?
</P>
<P>
   Critics say online education is less about teaching than about
cost-cutting and transforming teaching, via mass-produced software,
into a commodity, which universities can profit from the same way
they profit from research patents. Software can serve as text,
study guide and learning exercises, providing all the materials
needed for a course.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Noble, a professor of history at York University in
Toronto and currently a visiting professor at Harvey Mudd College,
argues that because quality will be so hard to monitor, the growth
projections are wildly inflated. Online education, he says, will be
no more than a very expensive fad, just like the vogue for
correspondence courses, which peaked in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no case for pedagogical enhancement,'' said
Noble, who has posted a series of three papers on (where else?) the
Internet (communication.ucsd.edu/dl). The papers, ``Digital Diploma
Mills: The Automation of Higher Education,'' have become ground
zero for professorial skepticism about a headlong rush toward the
virtual university.
</P>
<P>
   Noble's qualm is not about French or Japanese executives taking
Duke's M.B.A. courses, or farmers taking agronomy courses via
computer at the University of Wyoming. It is about the way Internet
courses will be used on campus.
</P>
<P>
   One report by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
predicts a huge shift toward electronic courses as a trend toward
lifelong learning swells enrollment. The report suggests that
software will serve about 50 percent of the total student
enrollment in community colleges and 35 percent in four-year
institutions. Which raises the specter of a tiered educational
system _ green quads, small classes and Gothic touches for the
privileged few _ and software for the many.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the report suggests that the real issue is how to
integrate the personal qualities of great teaching with the
technological advantages of learning by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Oberlin College president Nancy Dye said she keeps hearing how
distance learning in one form or another will reinvent higher
education. She cites, for example, the management guru Peter
Drucker's prediction that ``30 years from now, the big university
campuses will be relics,'' and that the residential university is
destined to give way to the virtual university.
</P>
<P>
   She does not worry about that happening at elite schools like
Oberlin. What she wonders is whether online teaching will expand
access to education or whether it will provide a shriveled version
to the students who can't afford the gourmet institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of good in educational technology if we use it
right,'' Dr. Dye said. ``But education will always be a social
process, and it will always include face-to-face connection. What
worries me is that somehow, places like Oberlin will become more
the exception than the norm. That's fairly farfetched at this
point, but I'm troubled by the enthusiasm with which, say, Western
Governors University seems to be embracing that kind of model.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they come for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Alyssa Cooper takes Computer-Mediated Communications online at
Teachers College at Columbia University because she broke her leg
just before the semester started, and it would have cost a fortune
in taxi fares to travel to class. Dianne Taha takes the same course
while working full time in the department of instructional
computing at the State University Center at Stony Brook, and Martha
Luckey takes it from Japan, where she is a counselor at a school
for children of American military personnel. All three women are
taking these classes toward advanced degrees in instructional
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sikkenga, a business analyst for desktop
telecommunications, is working on a degree in computer information
systems at the two-year-old Florida Gulf Coast University, taking
some classes online so he does not take too much time from his job
and family.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of these students see a promising but imperfect
medium that will work for motivated, self-directed people, which is
why online education is considered better for older students.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sikkenga, like others, finds the technology both appealing and
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   He could not afford the necessary software for his first
Internet class, so he had to use a computer on campus. That
defeated part of the purpose of taking the course online. He is
also frustrated by the plodding responses in one course's chat room
_ students wait while others laboriously type in responses to
instructor's questions _ and he misses the real give-and-take of a
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this type of education matures and bandwidth on the
Internet increases,'' he said, ``integration of streaming video and
other types of multimedia technology may make the distance-learning
class a lively and participatory experience that may eventually
compete successfully with any campus-based class. Until then, I'll
be very selective.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even the biggest proponents of online education say
that without technological advances like an increase in Web
bandwidth _ transmitting more information faster _ true
interactivity will be out of reach. And numerous issues, from the
intellectual property rights of faculty members to monitoring test
results from a distance, pose vexing problems.
</P>
<P>
   But to students and teachers, online education offers more than
convenience. For all the mythology of the classroom, many students
show up and snooze rather than learn. For all the appeal of
face-to-face interaction, it is hard to quarrel with the potential
of M.B.A. students on three continents tackling management problems
online.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein said that part of the dynamic of computerized
learning for him is that it forces students to focus, to be active
participants in learning rather than empty vessels into which
professors try to pour their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Many students agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sit at a computer to participate in a
distance-learning class, you are there and you have already
committed to participating,'' Ms. Taha said. ``It's very easy to
attend a face-to-face class, but not really be there mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   So if there are plenty of professors who see online learning as
a threat, there are others drawn to something more profound than
the idea of letting tired middle managers attend business school at
home in their pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schroeder describes himself as an ``atomic city kid'' from
Los Alamos, N.M. After graduate school in comparative literature at
Columbia University, he eventually became a popular professor of
humanities at the University of Colorado in Boulder. But he also
became intrigued by the potential of the computer in learning, how
databases and computer programs can spur new kinds of cognition
that makes students active learners rather than spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he started his own company, Digital Creators,
which creates software and training programs for universities and
businesses. He left his teaching position a year ago to work full
time on it.
</P>
<P>
   To Schroeder, online learning represents a natural evolution of
education, from Socratic dialogue to written text to digital. He
says online education never will _ and never should _ replace the
classroom, especially for the traditional college-age market, but
the technology's growth is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students today no longer think textually; they think
filmically,'' he said. ``This is a natural evolution. William Blake
talked of taking ideas and turning them into icons and worshiping
them. What we've done with technology is to turn it into an icon
that people worship or they fear. But the technology is merely an
extension of our capabilities, a way to expand our ability to
learn. I'm not going to be an idiot and say personal contact is not
important. But this is something in its infancy, and it's only
going to grow.''

   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ At sunrise on Sunday, the Rev. Stephen M.
Johnson and fellow worshippers will gather for an Easter service on
a bleak, windswept hill here.
</P>
<P>
   They will stand by a small cross of stones, a rough marker of
the spot where Matthew Shepard was beaten, robbed and left to die,
lashed to wooden fence poles.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since the fatal beating of Shepard, a gay
21-year-old college student, the spot has become a pilgrimage site,
as people bearing poems and floral bouquets have worn deep ruts in
a dirt track to the lonely section of fence.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as a chill wind blew, Johnson, a Unitarian minister,
reflected: ``I have seen people come out here with a pocketknife
and take a piece of the fence, like a relic, like an icon. To have
a piece of the experience here is powerful to people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, six months to the day after Shepard was beaten and
abandoned here, these powerful emotions will be focused on the
granite Albany County Courthouse, where Russell A. Henderson, the
first of two defendants, is to go on trial on charges of
first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate trial in August, the other defendant, Aaron J.
McKinney, is to face trial on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Shepard, who was a boyish, slightly built freshman at
the University of Wyoming, became an overnight symbol of violence
against gay people, inspiring hundreds of vigils and rallies and
countless discussions around the United States and around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for an enormous amount of news media interest in the
trial, the presiding state district judge, Jeffrey Donnell, has
banned television cameras and radio microphones from the courtroom,
set up a special area for protesters, tightened police security,
and ordered that the jury be sequestered after opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
   This tremendous interest has already become a theme of complaint
for Wyatt Skaggs, the court-appointed lawyer for Henderson, a
21-year-old who was working as a roofer when he was arrested on
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In December, when Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney,
announced that he would seek the death penalty in both cases,
Skaggs called the choice ``politically motivated,'' noting that
this would be Wyoming's first capital murder trial in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the defense lawyer told prospective jurors, ``We've
got to begin by disregarding the guilt thing, that we have to
punish somebody to show the nation we're not some dusty old cow
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs added, ``The press wants us to think that we are somehow
responsible for what went on Oct. 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, Skaggs indicated that he would fight for
his client's life, but would not dispute his presence at the fence.
He conceded to juror candidates that the police had recovered a
jacket belonging to Henderson that was spattered with Shepard's
blood.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer said that his client did not profit from the $20
robbery and did not participate in the pistol-whipping of Shepard,
who was 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 105 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew
Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
</P>
<P>
   As this university town of 30,000 people prepares for a trial
that is expected to last through April, gay organizers here and
around the nation are taking measure of the distance traveled since
Shepard's death was on front pages and magazine covers the world
over.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, many organizers are frustrated that widespread
horror over the murder never translated into political support for
hate-crime bills around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a gap between rhetoric and what politicians are
willing to do in terms of public policy,'' said Kerry Lobel,
executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a
gay rights group based in Washington. ``Nearly everyone expressed
their condolences. But condolences in an environment of hatred and
homophobia is cheap talk.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Thirteen state legislatures, including New York's, are debating
bills to raise penalties for crimes motivated by antigay bias. But
every hate-crime bill that went to a state legislature for a vote
this winter was defeated, including one in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, less than one month after Shepard died in a
hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., voters there rejected adding
``sexual orientation'' to a city antidiscrimination ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Baker-Easley, acting director of a local gay community
center, said, ``The knife through the heart was having people vote
the ordinance down as soundly as they did, by a larger proportion
than 10 years earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to stir interest in federal hate-crime legislation, Judy
Shepard, Matthew's mother, addressed a news conference in
Washington in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes
from happening, but they can reduce them,'' said Mrs. Shepard, who
later traveled here for the trial from her home in Saudi Arabia,
where the family had moved for a job. ``They can help change the
climate in this country, where some people feel it is OK to target
specific groups of people and get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the recent political defeats, many antiviolence
organizers sense that the impact of Shepard's death was more
subtle. They say he gave a human face to antigay violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew Shepard humanized gay people _ he busted the
stereotypes,'' said Brian Levin, director of Stockton College's
Center on Hate and Extremism in Pomona, N.J. ``Gays were no longer
these leather-clad, flamboyantly dressed people from San Francisco.
It was the sweet kid next door.''
</P>
<P>
   David M. Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
political organization in Washington, summed it up this way:
``Matthew represented people's brother, people's son, people's best
friend. It all came together to touch people in a way that other
murders had not. It caused discussions to take place at dinner
tables across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard stamped a memorable face on a long-disguised problem of
bigotry toward gay people, said Kevin Jennings, executive director
of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a change of heart in the heartland, requests for help
have poured in from school administrators around the country, said
Jennings, whose organization trains teachers and students in an
effort ``to end homophobia in K through 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from helping to set up a gay tolerance program in public
schools in Des Moines, Iowa, Jennings said Friday from New York:
``There has been a real jump when people in Iowa and Kansas City
realize that this is not simply a problem in New York and San
Francisco. If teachers in Des Moines or in Kansas City want to do
something, that is ultimately more important than legislation.
Legislation will follow.''

 BRADLEY AND McCAIN WALK TIGHTROPE IN FINANCING CAMPAIGNS  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., devoted
years to scorning the campaign finance system as riddled with
loopholes and ruled by wealthy interests. But that has not deterred
him from partaking in it himself.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent reception at the elegant Four Seasons Hotel, Bradley
snagged moneyed Democrats between their bites of beef Wellington
and seafood parfait and tried to persuade them to contribute to his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is also known for championing
campaign reform. But there he was the other day at a fund-raising
brunch at the classy Sequoia restaurant on the Potomac River in
Washington. For $250, donors were treated to a buffet, topped off
with a speech by McCain, who is seeking the Republican nomination.
For $1,000, donors also got their photographs taken with the
senator and hobnobbed with him at a reception beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and McCain argue that the existing laws leave them no
choice but to devote much time to traveling the country hunting for
millions of dollars or hitting up prospects during interminable
telephone calls. Neither is willing to follow the lead of Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., who co-sponsored a campaign finance bill
with McCain. Feingold almost lost his re-election last year because
of several restrictions he imposed on his own fund raising, like
limiting unregulated donations and collecting most of the money
from within the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play by whatever the rules are,'' Bradley said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the paradox is striking: Never before in U.S. politics have
two contenders (or even one) so identified with campaign reform
taken to the presidential fund-raising circuit. Ross Perot made his
disdain for the system one of his signature issues in the 1992
campaign. But because he dipped into his own fortune to finance his
race, Perot could spurn the system that he had vowed to overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore their seriousness about reform _ and to counter
criticism that they are hypocrites _ both Bradley and McCain have
taken some steps to restrict the ways in which they collect money.
Unlike many of their opponents, they did not establish shadow
organizations in states like Virginia. Doing so would have enabled
them to raise huge sums of unregulated money. Bradley has also
refused money from political action committees, a concession that
McCain has not made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley and McCain are walking the tightest tightrope of any
candidates,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center
for Responsive Politics, a campaign reform advocacy group in
Washington. ``They've got to raise the money. But they've got to do
it cleaner than any one else.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reputations as reformers have posed opportunities and
obstacles for Bradley and McCain. Rather than shy away from the
issue, both candidates are highlighting it _ even at their own
fund-raising events _ to try to bestow populist, outsider tilts
upon their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley avoids the subject, but his supporters do not shrink
from drawing a contrast with Vice President Al Gore, who was
accused of bending campaign finance laws in the 1996 campaign.
McCain eagerly pounces on the vice president's practices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McCain and Bradley are soliciting from the
very interests they have assailed. McCain, in particular, is a
magnet for contributors because he is chairman of the influential
Senate Commerce Committee; whether he is White House bound or not,
many lobbyists see it as in their interest to donate to him.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns have lined up big corporate names to help raise
money. McCain's roster includes Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the
American International Group; Richard Notebaert, chairman of
Ameritech Corp.; Henry Paulson, chief executive of Goldman, Sachs,
and Jerry Reinsdorf, chairman of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox.
Bradley's fund-raisers include Leonard Riggio, chief executive of
Barnes &AMP; Noble; Thomas Labrecque, president of the Chase Manhattan
Corp.; Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, and John
Bryan, chief executive of Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The two campaigns performed respectably in the first quarter of
this year, each taking in more than $4 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Though their cries for change may catch on with voters _ and
even contributors _ others are offended that McCain and Bradley
have been so outspoken. Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson
has pointedly discouraged Republicans from backing McCain. He said
the senator's campaign finance proposal threatened the coalition's
ability to promote candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John McCain has done a great deal of harm to
grass-roots movements like the Christian Coalition through that
McCain-Feingold bill,'' Robertson said in a recent interview with
CNN. ``It's going to be very hard to mobilize people to support
him. I don't see him really going too far.''
</P>
<P>
   And backers of Gore have privately warned labor leaders that
Bradley's campaign finance stands would undermine unions' influence
in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, chairman of Democracy 21, a policy group based
in Washington, said Bradley and McCain had been singled out because
they were genuine reformers. ``I have spent 30 years working on the
campaign finance issue,'' he said. ``These two guys are for real in
their commitment to changing the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Because political action committees usually contribute only a
tiny fraction of donations to presidential campaigns, even Bradley
acknowledged that his rejection of PAC money was essentially
symbolic. (Gore also refuses PAC donations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't give much _ what, $4 million?'' Bradley said.
``First of all, it's what I do because of what I believe about
campaign finance reform. That's where it starts. And the second
level is that you're making a judgment that by eschewing the most
visible examples of the way campaigns are now financed, you will
draw people to your cause who recognize that there's something
different about it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McCain also expressed confidence that his stand on campaign
finance would ultimately help, not hinder, his quest. ``The people
who disagree with me on campaign finance reform, I believe, are
obviously misinformed because they believe that this is going to
inhibit their ability to carry out their political agenda,'' he
said in an interview. ``And obviously, that's the last thing I
want. Do I want the Democrats to win elections? No. So the majority
of Republicans that I talk to believe that the system is broken,
that it's corrupt and needs to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seems a bit sheepish in his appeals to donors. At the
event here at the Four Seasons _ in the same ballroom where
Republicans held their own big money event several weeks ago _ the
former senator's pitch was about his cautiousness in seeking
donations, not about his need for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to raise money in a little different way,''
Bradley said. ``Because I believe strongly in campaign finance
reform, I think I have to set a standard that is higher than the
existing law. And so I don't take any PAC contributions, and I
don't set up sham state PACs in states like Virginia that are
totally unregulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left it to one of the organizers of the reception, John
Kessler, for the hard sell. ``We have to put fuel in the fire,''
implored Kessler, chairman of an investment company in Parsippany,
N.J. ``The fuel is the money.'' The take was roughly $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   At McCain's reception in Washington, attended by friends from
the Naval Academy, the senator collected about $85,000. He did not
mention reform but vowed to spend his contributions wisely. ``There
are two aspects to money in a campaign,'' he said. ``Not just how
you raise it, but how you spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Bradley said it was not easy to solicit more
than $20 million, mostly in increments of $1,000, the most any
individual can give. With a smile, McCain said he had been tempted
by offers of unregulated money that he cannot accept. ``We got a
check from one guy for $10,000,'' he recalled. ``I had to say, `I'm
sorry pal, but if you've got some close family members who are over
18 ...'''

VICTORY BY CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE IS FIRST FOR GREENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL STAGGS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ When fellow Green Party members persuaded
Audie Bock to run for the state Assembly last December, they told
her she had a choice. She could run a symbolic campaign by putting
her name on the ballot _ or she could campaign seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was up against when we started off with zero
money and a few volunteers.'' said Ms. Bock, 53, who lives in
Piedmont, a city bounded on all sides by Oakland. ``But I decided I
wanted to get in there, to offer a true alternative to machine
politics, to really do something and say something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bock chose to run a real race, and she won _ making her the
first member of the Green Party to serve in a state legislature
anywhere in the nation, and the first third-party candidate to
serve in the California Assembly since 1914.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party, which was born in Germany in 1979 and made its
way to the United States in 1984, originally focused on
environmental issues, but in recent years has embraced other
causes, including health care, social justice and education.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bock _ a film distributor and junior college ethnic-studies
instructor _ won 50.5 percent of the vote in Tuesday's runoff
election to squeak by Elihu Harris, the former two-term Oakland
mayor. Harris had previously held the Assembly seat from 1978 to
1990. Ms. Bock won by 327 votes of a total of 29,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had been heavily favored to win in the February
election, Harris, one of three Democratic candidates, failed to get
50 percent of the vote. In the absence of a Republican candidate,
Ms. Bock, with 8.6 percent of the vote, landed in the runoff with
Harris. The former mayor spent a reported $550,000, while Ms. Bock
spent $33,000.
</P>
<P>
   Voter registration in the 16th District, which includes the
cities of Piedmont and Alameda and a large part of Oakland, is 65
percent Democratic, 33 percent Republican and 1.3 percent Green.
And so solid has the Democratic Party's hold been on the district
that Ms. Bock's win is the first by a non-Democrat since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Local political analysts said Harris ran a lackluster campaign,
with too great an expectation that he would win. He also drew
criticism after the state Democratic Party distributed 3,800
vouchers for free chicken dinners to residents voting in the
February election. Although Harris' name was not associated with
the offer, he had been endorsed by the party.
</P>
<P>
   Harris did not return calls to his campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, a Democratic Party adviser based in Sacramento,
said it was surprising to lose the seat to an alternative political
party. He predicted that Ms. Bock's tenure would be limited to one
term of two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we lost,'' he said. ``There was a weak campaign by the
Democratic operation. But you can be sure that what just happened
in the 16th is a situation that will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bock sees her victory as a signal that many voters are ready
for a change from the Democratic rule of the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really want politicians to pay attention,'' Ms. Bock
said as she prepared for her new $99,000-a-year job in Sacramento,
her first elective office since she was voted senior class
secretary at nearby Berkeley High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying to their elected officials, listen up,'' she
said. ``We want national health care. We want national child
care.''

EDITORIAL: A SEASON OF SACRIFICE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   A cruel irony of the horror in Kosovo is that the events there
are unfolding in one of the holiest seasons of the year for the
religions that dominate the countries gripped by the conflict. By
accident of the lunar calendar, the observances of Easter, Passover
and the Muslim feast of sacrifice, Id al-Adha, all occur this week,
and few worshipers caught in the spirit of deliverance reflected in
each holiday will fail to be struck by the seeming absence of
anything redeeming about the war in the Balkans. But if solace can
be drawn in the coincidence of these days of prayer, it is in the
lesson of how much these religions have in common at a time when so
many of their adherents are in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Passover celebrates the emergence of the Jewish people, but its
universal drama is that of an escape from oppression, a declaration
of freedom and self-determination that remains at issue 3,500 years
after it was first heard. The ancient Hebrews' exodus from Egypt
clears the way for them to receive a code of conduct from one God,
a code that defines what forever makes them Jews. But as Jews eat
matzoh at Passover, the ``bread of affliction'' can symbolize not
simply the flight from Egypt, but the constant danger of regarding
any people as strangers in their own land. It is no accident that
the Passover seder has in recent years drawn the faithful from
other religions and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Alienation and expulsion, after all, is the oldest and perhaps
most shocking of human dramas. The tragedy in the Balkans now is
that there is no sign yet of any promise of return or deliverance,
but the deep yearning for that promise is surely what can lead to
action by others.
</P>
<P>
   The universal symbolism of Easter, which Orthodox Christians
celebrate April 11, is about a promise of salvation after defeat
that is of a deeply personal nature, rather than the emergence of a
people. For Christians and non-Christians alike, the story Easter
celebrates is that of one man maintaining his faithfulness before
the military might of an oppressive government and the taunts of
the crowd, a lesson of integrity and determination that has molded
much of civilization as we know it. This story of sacrifice and
redemption does little, of course, to lessen the pain in Kosovo.
But its vision of justice rising above the temporal powers of the
day is a reminder that the human spirit can triumph in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim holiday of Id al-Adha may be less familiar to most
Americans, but it too is about regeneration and is observed by a
vast multitude of people, including in this instance most of the
victims of the ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. It is a festival of
sacrifice and the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. As Muslims see fellow
Muslims forced from an inhospitable place in search of a place that
will receive them, they cannot help but think of Mohammed's
persecution and flight from Mecca to Medina, where he was welcomed
and where he built his faith. The holiday also commemorates
Abraham's sacrifice of the ram as a substitute for his son, with
its echoes of the paschal lamb of Passover and the lamb of God of
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Some have characterized the war in the Balkans as an ancient
implacable conflict among religions. But in fact, it is testimony
to the ability of ruthless leaders to persecute others in the name
of religion, ignoring the genuine tradition of tolerance enshrined
in Judaism, Christianity and Islam and articulated by the prophets,
saints and seers of each faith. In a season when adherents to these
great religions are worshiping God in their own ways, it is
especially important to remember the horrors of viewing others with
different backgrounds as strangers, or even enemies, whether they
live in Northern Ireland, the Balkans, the Middle East, Indonesia
or any other place of entrenched religious and ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Thus this season's confluence of holidays and horrors can serve
as a powerful reminder of that higher yearning among peoples of all
traditions.

EDITORIAL: SETTLING THE MICROSOFT CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   After a decidedly uneven presentation of its case in court,
Microsoft has come forward with a proposal to settle the antitrust
suit it has been challenging since last year. The word from the
Justice Department and some of the 19 state attorneys general
prosecuting the case is that Microsoft's initial offer does not
address their concerns about what they regard as anticompetitive
conduct by the company. But the department and the attorneys
general are right to pursue a possible settlement with Microsoft. A
negotiated agreement, if done right, would be preferable to years
of litigation, appeals and uncertainty for businesses and consumers
in the fast-changing computer and software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Any resolution of the antitrust suit, whether negotiated or
ordered by the courts, would have to remedy the problems defined
cogently by the Justice Department. Microsoft has been clearly
shown to exercise monopoly power in operating-systems software for
personal computers in ways that coerce competitors and clients,
depriving consumers of choices. The initial focus of the suit was
the contention that Microsoft, by tying its operating system to its
Internet Explorer browser, was muscling aside the rival browser
made by Netscape. During the trial, the prosecution expanded its
attack to include charges of strong-arm tactics against computer
makers, software rivals and others.
</P>
<P>
   In offering to settle, Microsoft has put forth a document
suggesting that it would consider changes in its restrictive
contracts with Internet companies and computer makers, including
possible limits on its ability to customize the opening screen of
Windows. But before accepting such promises, the Justice Department
would have to be satisfied that Microsoft truly had changed its
ways. The best mechanism to guarantee this might be an agreement on
new rules for pricing and other incentives to insure freedom of
choice by the company's rivals and consumers. If a set of adequate
ground rules cannot be agreed upon, the company may find itself
faced with demands for an outright breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the Justice Department tried to reach a settlement
before the trial began last October. They are silent now about
their talks, which may be a healthy sign. Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson of U.S. District Court has called for the trial to resume
in May, but talks could continue even after that date. The company
should be commended for at least raising the possibility of a
settlement. Its behavior contrasts with that of Sen. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., the company's home state. Gorton has turned into a
Microsoft cheerleader, and clumsily tried to cut off antitrust
appropriations for the Justice Department. He also belittled
Jackson in a recent visit with employees at the company's
headquarters in Redmond. Microsoft immediately disassociated itself
from those comments, a recognition that serious discussion of the
issues is better than name-calling.

EDITORIAL: RATIONED WAR NEWS FROM KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c. 1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When democracies send their military forces into combat,
citizens need to know as much about the battles as sensible
security precautions permit. In the case of Kosovo, with Western
reporters barred by Yugoslavia from covering the conflict on the
ground, NATO and the Pentagon must provide a detailed account of
the effectiveness of the air war. It is a responsibility they have
so far largely failed to meet.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to limit NATO briefings to broad generalities comes
from Gen. Wesley Clark, the American commander of alliance forces
in Europe. Pentagon briefings have offered more target and damage
information but have been frustratingly short on important
specifics. The air offensive has not gone well in the first 10
days, and the American people should not be denied a full account
of the reasons, beyond the foul weather that has limited bombing
runs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO news briefings in Brussels, Belgium, have emphasized
Yugoslavia's violent assault on the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, a
vital part of the unfolding story. But NATO has provided only vague
and selective information about the allied bombing campaign. Few
details have been made available about specific targets hit and how
badly they have been damaged. The Pentagon has handed out a few
more crumbs of information, but in general Americans have little
idea whether NATO has managed to slow the Serbian sweep across
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not providing information about future targets,
which would clearly endanger NATO pilots. The need is for more
information about targets that have been attacked and a daily
assessment of how the air war is going. Yugoslav authorities
already know where NATO bombs have landed.
</P>
<P>
   Rationing war news is a familiar problem among American military
leaders and their civilian superiors. Misleading military briefings
eroded Washington's credibility during the Vietnam War. Yet since
then, the Pentagon has continued to try to manage combat
information, even during the impressive military successes of the
Persian Gulf war. But during that conflict, at least, there was
some restricted CNN coverage from Baghdad. For Kosovo, NATO and
Pentagon briefings are the only full-time Western source of
information, though some correspondents remain in Belgrade. The
chokehold on information fuels suspicions that NATO has withheld
more detailed reports to shield itself from criticism that it
failed to prepare a more intensive initial attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks ahead, President Clinton may seek public support
for escalating the air war, or even introducing ground troops into
combat. Complicated political and security issues will have to be
resolved before the conflict ends. It is essential that citizens
have all the information they need to make informed judgments as
these matters arise. Clinton and his counterparts in Europe do
themselves and their countries a disservice by so tightly
controlling information about the battle in Kosovo.

AN ANGEL ON HIS SHOULDER AT THE FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE De GREGORIO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Going to the Final Four is quite an experience, especially if
you start out without a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of attending this extravaganza, held this year in St.
Petersburg, Fla., came to me several months ago. It would have its
advantages for me: My son Steve lives and works in the area, and I
would stay with him and his family and enjoy the grandchildren. I
also had hope and faith that the University of Connecticut
basketball team, which I have cheered and supported for 47 years,
could at last attain the charmed circle of the Final Four and even
go on to win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Not having a ticket, of course, is quite daunting. And on top of
that, how about not being able to get a flight to Florida because
all seats seemed to be sold out? What did I expect on a weekend
when the Final Four, college spring break and religious observances
took place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday I decided to pack a bag and go by train, a 24-hour
trip. I would scrounge a ticket by hook or by crook. I had a
limited budget of crazy money in case I caved to the scalpers.
</P>
<P>
   I was off on a one-man odyssey. Before it was over, it would
give me an exhilarating emotional experience, a kismet-like
dimension _ that was not supposed to happen in this kind of
environment.
</P>
<P>
   I had asked around The New York Times to see if there were any
tickets available. No luck there. One editor thought he might be
able to make a contact, but that fizzled. He also asked a
basketball reporter to keep an eye open in case something turned
up.
</P>
<P>
   With the Saturday, March 27, semifinals a couple of hours away,
I still did not have a ticket. UConn-Ohio State was scheduled for
5:42 p.m. I had staked out a spot near the gate for the news media,
hoping to bump into someone I knew who could help me. It was hot;
temperatures were in the 80s. Sweat poured off me. ``I need one,''
I chanted, shooting one finger skyward.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4 p.m., two familiar faces bounded toward me _ two
reporters in ties and jackets and ready to write about the games
for The New York Times. They knew of my plight, but had not come up
with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick in there,'' they said. ``Something is bound to come
up.''
</P>
<P>
   I had become a UConn fan when I was a student there. After I
graduated in 1952, I became a sports reporter for The New Haven
Register and was assigned the UConn beat. Like the current coach,
Jim Calhoun, I and many other fans had endured the rap that UConn
was good to watch but not able to clear one hurdle, the leap to the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   As I waited, I chatted with a young reporter from The Orlando
Sentinel. At that moment, I realized that at my age _ old enough to
retire _ I must have looked odd and amusing to the young woman. I
thought: what am I doing out here in this blazing sun, acting like
a homeless vagabond, trying to crash an event in which young men in
the springtime of their lives were reaching for a dream of
excellence in a sport I once played, however tentatively, in my own
springtime? And I realized that yes, that was reason enough for
going.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I felt a tap on my left shoulder. I turned to see a
lean, middle-aged man, wearing glasses and a gray cap with no
insignia, standing behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' he said. ``I guess you're looking for a ticket. I've got
an extra one you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah?'' I said. ``How much?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' the man said. ``You'll be sitting next to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure I can't pay you?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look like a fan. I don't think you'll try to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   I pointed to the turnstile at Gate 6. ``I'm going right in
now,'' I said, trying to reassure him that I would indeed not sell
the ticket. ``I'll see you in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I was so flabbergasted, I didn't even look at the ticket to see
if it was real or where the seat was situated.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a hot dog and a soft drink and went to my seat _
Section 314, Row R, Seat 24, on the aisle. I was way up there, but
the view was unobstructed. I could see everything. On the scalpers'
listings, this one was going for $500.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before game time, the man arrived. Quiet and unassuming,
he said he thought that of the four teams he would root for
Michigan State, but he liked UConn's chances. I asked him his name,
but he refused to give it. I asked where he lived, and he refused
to reveal that, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was very savvy about the tactics and strategy of the games _
the screening, the rebounding, the inside game, the press, the use
of timeouts, fouling, and how it all might play out.
</P>
<P>
   Between games, after UConn's victory over Ohio State, I offered
to buy refreshments. He refused. Again I offered to pay for the
tickets. I asked for his name again, his address, his phone number.
Each time he emphatically refused. ``You'll only send me money,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unusual thing you've done,'' I said. ``Not many
people would give these tickets away in this environment without
seeking a big profit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a fan,'' he said. ``I know you wouldn't sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the Anti-Scalper, the Anti-Profiteer. Maybe he got his
kicks by standing firm in an age of fast-buck commercialism. He was
taciturn, but I couldn't call him strange or judge him. He might
have thought the same about me, birds of a feather, and had picked
me to receive his gift for that reason. Whatever, I was so
engrossed in the UConn play and victory that I wound up hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the second game, when Duke beat Michigan State, he
bounded into the crowd of more than 41,000, ignoring my pleas for
information about him, and seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The championship game was scheduled for 9:18 on Monday night. I
was still clinging to my budget in case I had to yield to a
scalper. This was one game I was not going to miss. At 6 p.m., I
still did not have a ticket. UConn might become the national
champion, and I might not see it happen.
</P>
<P>
   I staked out the media entrance again. The same feeling I had
had on Saturday came over me. The evening was cool. One fellow
sported a sign reading: ``Need One Ticket, Desperately. My Life
Depends on It.'' Panic time was setting in _ surrender to the
scalper or go watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I felt a tap on my left shoulder. I turned to see the
same lean, unassuming man with the gray cap staring at me. He was
selling nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got an extra ticket again,'' he said, recognizing me.
``It's yours if you want it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to let me pay you this time,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' he said. ``I know you won't sell it because you're a
fan. I'll see you up there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took his spot beside me _ Section 314, Row R, Seat 23 _
he seemed to want to say he would be noncommittal about which team
he favored, but he was as engrossed as I was throughout by the
exceptional play between UConn and the powerful Duke team.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best games I've seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I managed to get him to say he was from Miami, but his name,
address, phone number, occupation, family remained private.
</P>
<P>
   I was able to buy him a cup of Carvel ice cream at halftime. He
reluctantly accepted it, and he seemed to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   He did not stay for the post-game ceremony after UConn's
victory, disappearing into the crowd as he had done on Saturday
night. He went out of my little odyssey as mysteriously as he had
come into it.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to think he was a true basketball fan, one who saw
too much crass commercialism in an event and a game that he loved
and respected, and he would not sell out. Maybe he wanted to share
that with somebody, thereby coming to the rescue of a kindred
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I knew who he was, but does it really matter?

CAPITAL DEMONSTRATION WIDENS SUPPORT FOR DIALLO RALLIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Texas, Calif., Ill. Pa.)   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Led by the relatives of victims of police brutality
from across the country, thousands of demonstrators marched past
the Justice Department Saturday as protests inspired by the death
of Amadou Diallo shifted from New York to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting the familiar cry of ``No Justice, No Peace,'' the
demonstrators marched to the Capitol for a rally to demand a wide
range of federal responses to police brutality, including a
presidential commission, congressional hearings and legislation
mandating federal reports on police abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, many of whom boarded buses before dawn to
reach Washington in time for Saturday's event, included some who
have kept the anger over the Diallo shooting simmering in New York
for two months through daily protests and acts of civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of relatives and supporters of victims of
alleged police brutality from as far away as Texas and California
reflected the nationwide attention drawn to the case of Diallo, the
unarmed African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 bullets fired by
four New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event, called the National Emergency March for
Justice and Against Police Brutality, was organized by the Center
for Constitutional Rights, a civil rights advocacy group based in
New York that has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to halt
operations of the New York Police Department's Street Crime Unit.
The officers involved in the Diallo shooting were members of that
unit.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference before the march, organizers said they
hoped to undertake a national movement, inspired by the recent
action in New York City, to demand reforms in police policy and in
the handling of abuse and misconduct cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come resolved to galvanize a new national movement to
fight for police reform and accountability,'' said Ron Daniels, the
executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights.
``Following the example set by our brothers and sisters in New York
under the able leadership of the Rev. Al Sharpton, we intend to
mobilize and organize to fight for social, economic and racial
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, standing outside the First Congregational Church in
downtown Washington, where the march began, said, ``The senseless
police murder of Amadou Diallo was the proverbial straw that broke
the camel's back.'' But he added, the Diallo case ``is the tip of
the iceberg in terms of the scourge of police brutality misconduct
afflicting communities of color and poor communities across this
nation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although several speakers said they had been galvanized by the
protests in New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he did not
believe New York was a focal point of Saturday's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a very unfair impression,'' Giuliani said,
speaking to reporters at the New York International Auto Show.
``There are cases and situations all over the country. In fact, the
New York City Police Department has one of the best records in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in Saturday's march said the Diallo case has made
for a compelling rallying cry and has become the focus of opponents
of police abuses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``His case has sparked a real eye-grabber throughout the nation
and around the world,'' said Endure X, a member of a group called
the African Revolutionized Soldiers, who traveled from Cincinnati
to join the march. ``To have somebody shot that many times who did
not even have a penknife on him really makes our country look
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As they marched, many of the demonstrators carried placards
bearing photographs of victims of alleged police violence. The
names of some of the more well-known of these victims, including
Abner Louima of Brooklyn, Jonny E. Gammage of Pittsburgh and Rodney
King of Los Angeles, were invoked again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said his group's lawsuit against the Street Crime Unit,
charging a pattern of illegal searches and arrests, would proceed
and even expand to include additional plaintiffs, despite recent
changes made by Police Commissioner Howard Safir, including putting
the unit's officers in uniform and adding more minority officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a change in complexion and a change of uniform is
encouraging,'' Daniels said, ``the most fundamental question is a
change of attitude and policy.'' Referring to Mayor Giuliani,
Daniels said, ``It's past time for him to begin steps toward
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration capped an emotional week that included the
indictment on second-degree murder charges of the four members of
the Street Crime Unit who shot Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building. All four of the officers pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators here were also buoyed by the suggestion Saturday
by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, that he
would seek to have charges dropped against the approximately 1,200
people who were arrested during acts of civil disobedience outside
Police Headquarters in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who led the protests and coordinated the acts of civil
disobedience, held a news conference in New York with the father of
Amadou Diallo before leaving to attend the Washington march.
Sharpton said he planned to tour the country with Diallo to protest
police brutality.

COMMENTARY: SHOCKING TEETH INTO SUBMISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, April 5)  
(DW) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are like me and hate to floss, then you will be glad to
hear of a new study that says chewing aluminum foil can reduce
cavities.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot remember the exact details of the study because as soon
as I saw the words ``chewing'' and ``aluminum foil'' in the same
sentence, I shut my eyes tight and clapped my hands over my mouth.
(I pretty much have the same reaction when I see the words ``Bob
Dole'' and ``Viagra'' in the same sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   All I recall is that the researcher concluded there is something
about the electrical charge generated by chewing aluminum foil that
scares Tooth Decay away, though he probably used a more scientific
term than `` Tooth Decay.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with most scientific studies, this one raises
more questions than it answers.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1, who in their right mind would volunteer for this
experiment? I am trying to estimate how much someone would have to
pay me to grind away on a wad of Reynolds Wrap, but my official New
York Times pocket calculator only goes to eight decimal places, so
I can't say for sure. But it would be a lot.
</P>
<P>
   (Even as I'm writing this, I'm recalling the times that I've
popped a piece of chewing gum into my mouth only to discover,
electrically, a few seconds later that a tiny piece of wrapper foil
had adhered to the gum and how I wished, at that moment, that my
fillings were made of a less conductive substance like, say, wood
putty.)
</P>
<P>
   No. 2, how much electrical charge is necessary to scare away
Tooth Decay? Are we talking the voltage necessary to power one of
those musical birthday cards or something more resembling the
electrical needs of the New York subway system?
</P>
<P>
   I am as supportive of a conscientiously applied program of oral
hygiene and regular professional care as the next Crest user (who
also happens to have good dental insurance), but I have to wonder
if cavity-free teeth are a good trade-off for a mouth that
regularly jams communication satellites and can cook a hot dog at
50 paces.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3, isn't it possible that people who chew aluminum foil have
bigger problems than tooth decay? I am no psychologist, but one has
to think that aluminum-foil chewers are crying out for help, and
not just because their fillings are picking up radio broadcasts of
Elvis singing live from the sixth planet orbiting Alpha Centauri.
</P>
<P>
   Another question I have is: Why aluminum foil? Of all the
substances you could ask test volunteers to chew on, why did the
researchers select the one that is most likely to make the subjects
feel as though they've just clamped their molars down on a
high-tension wire? Did the volunteers start off by chewing on
less-irritating substances like, say, jelly doughnuts? Then we move
up the ladder through ... what? Ground glass? Rusty nails? Aquarium
gravel?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the animal rights nuts go ballistic when laboratory rats
don't get enough exercise ...
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to come across as anti-science, but as far as I'm
concerned, you could promise me a set of chompers like those
displayed by the creature in the dental-health classic, ``Alien,''
and I would still not think of Reynolds Wrap as a desirable
between-meal snack.
</P>
<P>
   Though, I've got to admit, it would be nice hearing Elvis again.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very chilly air will advance southward through New England in
the wake of low pressure moving off the Maine coast. Unlike most
disturbances, the air circulation will come from the northeast
rather than from the northwest behind the cold front. As a result,
a band of showers will mainly follow the front due to moisture
being drawn inland from the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Preceding the front, very mild air will cover most of the Middle
Atlantic region and southern New England early Sunday. Clouds will
dominate, but a freshening breeze from the west will bring
intervals of sunshine near the east slopes of the Appalachians.
Readings may reach 85 degrees in parts of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of humid air stretching from east Texas to the
southern Appalachians will promote showers and thunderstorms in the
Gulf states. Repetitive showers may lead to flooding in parts of
Louisiana. The Southeast be partly sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of a winter storm over North Dakota will still
produce a variety of inclement conditions along the Canadian
border. A cold rain will be mixed with ice in northern Michigan.
Snow will diminish to showers and flurries in the western Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   A swath of dry, pleasant, but a bit cooler air will cover the
central Plains and upper Mississippi Valley. More snow and rain
showers will accompany low pressure moving into southern Colorado.
Heavy snow will fall in parts of the southern Rockies. Sunshine
will return to large sections of the Pacific Coast, but clouds and
showers will move into the Northwest later on.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Patchwork Snowstorm
</P>
<P>
   When wintry weather comes to Colorado, a few miles makes a
staggering difference in the depth of new fallen snow. Friday
morning, 4 feet of snow covered the San Juan Mountains, while on
the other side of the Front Range, the blanket of white was just 6
inches deep in Colorado Springs. Colorado storms are shaped by the
cooling of moist air that ascends the steep slopes. The temperature
of moist air falls three degrees for each 1,000 feet it rises. As
the air cools more water vapor condenses into flakes, resulting in
a patchwork of snow depths that responds to the undulating terrain.

   Maybe, in a reverse of ``Damn Yankees,'' it was George
Steinbrenner who made a deal with the devil last year. Now the
Yankees are starting to pay for it. Not that they will suddenly
become incapable of gaining their second straight full-season
division championship for the first time since 1978. But they begin
the season with their manager sidelined recovering from surgery for
prostate cancer and one of their hitters, Darryl Strawberry, still
rehabilitating from colon cancer. On the other hand, they have
added Roger Clemens to their starting rotation, and that is no
routine addition. He should make Don Zimmer's job as interim
manager easier. So will hitters like Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter,
Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON Pitching was the strength of the Yankees'
remarkable 1998 season, and it could be again this season. But some
cracks have appeared: Andy Pettitte's elbow and Hideki Irabu's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Blue Jays
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fregosi, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 88-74, third place
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War ended a quarter-century ago, but it caused the
Blue Jays enough problems this spring that they changed managers.
Tim Johnson had to go, the Blue Jays concluded, because his
fanciful tales of service in Vietnam had become a distraction to
the team. Enter Jim Fregosi, who took the 1993 Phillies to the
World Series but has had only one other winning record in eight
other full seasons of managing. The team acceded to Roger Clemens'
wishes to be traded and in the process gained a substitute starting
pitcher, David Wells, and a starting second baseman, Homer Bush. As
spring training neared an end, however, the Blue Jays were still
looking for a designated hitter, a role filled productively last
year by Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Wells, Bush, Joey Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Clemens, Canseco, Woody Williams.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON The Blue Jays, not having replaced Canseco's
productivity, may suffer offensively, so the pitching staff will
have to lead the fight for a wild-card spot. Kelvim Escobar could
play a key role in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles
</P>
<P>
   Ray Miller, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 79-83, fourth place
</P>
<P>
   Ray Miller survived the Cuba game, but how far will he last into
the season? The fate of Miller, owner Peter Angelos' hand-picked
manager, will be determined by how well the team does after being
hastily put together in seemingly haphazard fashion. The Orioles
lost a host of players to free agency, so they scrambled to find
others to fill the holes: Albert Belle to hit home runs and drive
in runs, Will Clark to replace Rafael Palmeiro at first base,
Delino DeShields to replace Roberto Alomar at second. They also
acquired Charles Johnson to bolster their catching. Last year,
Miller directed the highest-paid team in baseball history to a
losing record. This year the payroll is even higher. Good luck,
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Belle, Johnson, DeShields, Clark, Mike Timlin,
Heathcliff Slocumb, Jeff Conine.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Palmeiro, Alomar, Eric Davis, Armando Benitez, Jimmy
Key, Alan Mills.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON Belle has to have a monstrous season, Timlin has
to show he can save games and the Orioles have to show they have an
idea of how to win.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 92-70, second place (won wild card)
</P>
<P>
   No Mo fun at Fenway. That's the forecast for the Red Sox, who in
their unique way invited Mo Vaughn to leave and did not replace him
after he accepted their invitation. They will be hard pressed to
replace his 40 home runs and 115 runs batted in, not to mention his
.337 batting average, which was only two points below the league's
best. Jose Offerman, who came at a steep price, is not the one to
make up for all that, as he told everyone all spring, and after
.323, 35 and 122 last year, there can be no more from Nomar
Garciaparra this season. Maybe Trot Nixon (.310, 23, 74 in the
minors) will have a sensational rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Offerman, Mark Portugal, Pat Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Vaughn, Dennis Eckersley.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON The pitching staff, which had the league's
second-lowest earned run average last season, will have to hold the
fort while the hitters figure out how to score runs.

<P>
   1998: 63-99, fifth place
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 12 years, his entire major league career,
Fred McGriff did not hit 20 home runs last season. For the first
time in 10 seasons he did not drive in 85 runs. For maybe the first
time in his career, McGriff worked out hard this winter. He never
used to do much in the off-season, said a Devil Rays official. At
the age of 35, McGriff has had a wake-up call. The Devil Rays hope
that as a result, he will light a spark in them, so that they
improve significantly at the age of 2. Wade Boggs, 40, does not
need a wakeup call. He needs 78 hits as the platooned third baseman
to reach 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Jose Canseco, Bobby Witt.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON The Devil Rays scored nearly 100 runs fewer than
the league's next lowest-scoring team, which is why they signed
Canseco. They need him and McGriff to provide the punch that was
missing in their rookie season.

<P>
   Mike Hargrove, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 89-73, first place
</P>
<P>
   If the division were a rock group, it would be the Ten Big
Indians and the Four Stooges. The other four teams are there to
serve as fodder for the Indians, who will win their fifth
consecutive division title. As a way of keeping his players from
sleepwalking until the post-season, Mike Hargrove has challenged
them to win 100 games, a plateau they have reached only once in
their four championship seasons. With the addition of Roberto
Alomar, the Indians have an All-Star at each of the nine field
positions. Not content with their star status, the Indians hope to
add a top-flight starting pitcher, especially Curt Schilling, if he
is available, later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Roberto Alomar, Wil Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Chad Ogea, Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON They have 162 games to figure out how to beat the
Yankees, then win the World Series, which has eluded them in their
recent run.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Tigers
</P>
<P>
   Larry Parrish, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 65-97, fifth place
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Larry Parrish is not looking that far ahead, but in the
2000 season the Tigers could improve their record in a second
straight season for the first time since 1991. Of course, first
they have to improve on last season's disappointing 65-97. Parrish,
who managed the team on an interim basis last September, has
perhaps the most promising team in the league. The 1998 Tigers
broke their promise; these Tigers would like to fulfill theirs.
Juan Encarnacion (.329 in 40 games last year) is one of the team's
bright young hitters and should join a pair of new veterans, Dean
Palmer and Gregg Jefferies, in bolstering run production. Before
the Tigers' 88th and last season at Tiger Stadium is over, their
heralded rookie, outfielder Gabe Kapler, could contribute, too.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Palmer, Jefferies, Brad Ausmus, Willie Blair.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Luis Gonzalez, Joe Randa.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON They have to find a way, at least, to gain back
the 14 games they did not win last year that they won the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago White Sox
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manuel, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 80-82, second place
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas would not walk down Rush Street naked, but that is
how he will look at Comiskey Park. No Albert Belle, no Robin
Ventura, no one to hit with him in the team's depleted lineup. The
White Sox hope to get Thomas some help from Paul Konerko, a big
hitter in the minors but a disappointment so far in the majors
(.217 last season with the Dodgers and the Reds). Thomas himself
has to improve after the worst season, by far, of his nine-year
career. His .265 batting average slashed his career average 9
points to .321. South Side fans have tuned out the White Sox and
will most likely continue to ignore them until their rebuilding
plan produces a contender.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Belle, Ventura, Mike Cameron, Jim Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON Even if Thomas overcomes his nakedness in the
lineup, the team needs vast improvement in pitching (the league's
worst last year) and defense (tied for worst).

   The sale of the Royals, pending for many months, may take as
long to complete as it takes the team to get back to the playoffs.
The Royals have not been there since 1985, and they do not figure
to get there anytime soon, even under a new owner. In the interest
of having a lower payroll, the Royals could even take a step
backward by trading Jeff King, Kevin Appier and Jeff Montgomery,
their best but highest-priced players. Trades, however, are not
mandatory. Interesting to watch will be a pair of rookies, second
baseman Carlos Febles and center fielder Carlos Beltran. A third
rookie, Jeremy Giambi, brother of Oakland's Jason, could join them
as designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Rey Sanchez, Joe Randa, Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Dean Palmer, Jose Offerman, Tim Belcher, Jeff Conine.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON If the veterans go, the team will be less
developed than an expansion team.

   Minnesota Twins
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 70-92, fourth place
</P>
<P>
   The longest-running manager in the majors deserves an award for
loyalty, staying with the Twins despite a team that is getting
younger and cheaper. Gone are the days (1987 and '91) when Kelly
could steal a World Series championship. Now he will be lucky to
finish higher than last. Brad Radke's return to his 20-victory form
of two years ago would help Kelly, but with the team the Twins
have, Radke is unlikely to have that kind of season. This will be a
largely inexperienced team that could include a collection of
rookies: Doug Mientkiewicz, Cristian Guzman and Corey Koskie in the
infield and Chad Allen, Chris Latham and Torii Hunter in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Paul Molitor, Pat Meares, Bob Tewksbury, Otis Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON Some of the older players, such as Marty Cordova,
Ron Coomer and Denny Hocking, have to improve their game and lead
the youngsters.

<P>
   1998: 85-77, second place
</P>
<P>
   If the freakish broken arm that Gary DiSarcina suffered early in
spring training was an omen, the Angels will have another long
summer. If, on the other hand, the arrival of Mo Vaughn was the
positive sign the Angels sought, the summer could be warm and
wonderful. Vaughn's presence in the lineup and in the clubhouse
will make the Angels a more formidable threat. So, too, could Troy
Glaus at third and a healthy Todd Greene behind the plate or as the
DH. Glaus, playing his first professional season, slugged 36 home
runs for the Angels and two of their minor league teams last year.
The season will be successful if the Angels win and Chuck Finley
avoids batted balls. Three hit him last year.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Vaughn, Tim Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS Gregg Jefferies.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON In a division filled with good-hitting teams, the
winner could be the one with the best pitching. If the Angels'
veteran starters (Finley, Belcher, Ken Hill) stay healthy, they
could win the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 88-74, first place
</P>
<P>
   If Rick Helling and Aaron Sele can win 39 games between them
this season, the Rangers will win the division title again. They
did last year, in a mind-boggling feat that was as unexpected as
the home run heroics of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. The Rangers
need Helling and Sele to pitch as well again because the other
starters come with no guar-antees. John Wetteland, the closer, has
no guarantee, either, that his spring ailments are behind him.
Three-fourths of the infield is new from the beginning of last
season. Rafael Palmeiro has returned after a five-year hiatus in
Baltimore, while Royce Clayton and Todd Zeile are holdovers from
midseason trades. Juan Gonzalez is not new, but he's not old
either. At 29, he will pursue his third most valuable player award
in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Palmeiro, Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Will Clark, Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON If the pitching can keep up with the lusty
hitting, the league's best last year, the Rangers will return to
October.

   Seattle Mariners
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 76-85, third place
</P>
<P>
   People are so busy asking if the Mariners can keep both Ken
Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, who can be free agents in two
seasons, that they tend to forget that the two superstars could
power the Mariners to the playoffs this year. The team's prospects
improved when Jay Buhner demonstrated that he was ready to return
to right field after having had Tommy John elbow transplant surgery
last September. Randy Johnson is gone, of course, but the players
acquired for him are ready to help the Mariners. Carlos Guillen
will start at second base, Freddy Garcia will be in the starting
rotation after a sizzling spring and John Halama will be in the
bullpen. The Mariners move into their new stadium July 15.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Jose Mesa, John Mabry, Butch Huskey, Butch Henry.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES Mike Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON Pitching, pitching, pitching. Will the Mariners
have enough of it? They will be ecstatic if Mesa can give them the
closing effort they have sorely lacked.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Athletics
</P>
<P>
   Art Howe, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 74-88, fourth place
</P>
<P>
   Faced with survival of the fittest in the division, the
Athletics are trying to match the offense the other teams generate.
They have Ben Grieve, Matt Stairs and Jason Giambi, but they aren't
enough. The A's added the aging duo of Tony Phillips and Tim Raines
for spark, but that's a stopgap measure. The team is developing
youngsters, spreading them liberally throughout the lineup. The
latest rookie is Eric Chavez, who joins the 23-year-old shortstop
Miguel Tejada on the left side of the infield. However much power
comes from their bats, the Athletics will need runs because the
pitching does not figure to dominate anyone.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS Phillips, Raines.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSS Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON They have to match the big bats of the other
division teams or come up with stronger pitching than they seem to
have to rise above last place.

 &HT;    Jones amazes teammates, opponents
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andruw Jones plays the kind of center field that puts
fans in awe, gives opponents headaches and baffles even his
teammates, the guys who need his defense the most.
</P>
<P>
   Like the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux, student of the game that he is, likes to ``study''
Jones playing defense, up close and personal. He'll stand 20 feet
behind Jones in center field during batting practice, shadow his
moves and see if he can't play center field with him. It's not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When balls are hit off the bat, you pretty much say, `Well, I
can't catch that,' and you give up on it,'' Maddux said. ``And he
camps under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won his first Gold Glove last season as the National
League's best center fielder. It should be the first of many.
</P>
<P>
   He led all major-league outfielders by committing just two
errors in 435 chances. He led the majors with 413 putouts, the most
by a Braves outfielder since Sam Jethroe had 413 in 1952. Jones
tied for the major-league lead with 20 outfield assists.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll only turn 22 on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jones has spent a full season playing center for the
Braves, the comparisons to other active center fielders have
dwindled. Jones' name used to be thrown in with Ken Griffey Jr.,
Marquis Grissom and Kenny Lofton. Now it's with Willie Mays and Joe
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Viceisza, the scout who discovered Jones in
little-known Curacao, never saw any video of DiMaggio playing
center field when he was growing up. The first DiMaggio highlights
he saw were on TV last month after DiMaggio died.
</P>
<P>
   Viceisza, sitting at a table in the Braves press box at the
Disney complex, leaned in real close and said quietly, as if he
didn't want Jones to hear from the team clubhouse several floors
below, ``DiMaggio's better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones has time.
</P>
<P>
   When Viceisza first scouted Jones in November 1992, Jones was
15. Jones never picked up a bat during that tryout, but Viceisza
saw enough to get on the telephone with the Braves and persuade
Paul Snyder, director of scouting, to come down and see for
himself. Within a month, Jones was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see from the first minute that he was something,''
Viceisza said. ``He was so natural in everything he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was playing catcher for his youth team in Curacao. He
mostly had played that position and shortstop, but Viceisza saw
center field in him.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Jones is playing the best center field in the
game, maybe the best in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Of those center fielders Maddux has seen in his career, Jones is
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy,'' Maddux said. ``He catches everything. Balls that just
aren't caught, he catches. He catches maybe one or two a week that
you just never see caught, you won't see another guy catch. And
he'll catch them all, whether it's back, in, straight, to the side.
That's the thing. He makes it look so easy. It's to the point that
when he misses the ball it gives the effect that, `Oh, he didn't go
after that one.' But he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, even though Jones wasn't hitting and got into trouble
with manager Bobby Cox for not hustling, the Braves were willing to
give him some growing room in Atlanta instead of AAA Richmond. The
reason was mostly his defense.
</P>
<P>
   It has been his constant since he signed with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league prospect George Lombard played left field beside
Jones for a couple of months in 1995 in Class A Macon. Jones used
to catch balls in front of Lombard, playing the outfield as if he
didn't need left or right fielders. And for Lombard, it was OK. He
could admire a teammate who made playing the outfield look so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can play the outfield half as smooth as he does, I'll be
all right,'' Lombard said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jones turns the frustration on National League hitters, who
have much more to contend with than just a Greg Maddux cutter, a
Tom Glavine change-up or a John Smoltz fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can cover some ground out there as good as anybody, if not
the best,'' Houston Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said. ``A
lot of times you think you hit a ball that's going to fall, and he
closes the gap on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza knows the sentiment well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding outfielder, no question about that,''
Piazza said. ``With the type of pitching staff they have, they need
good defense, and he's the key. He knows how to play the hitters
and get a good jump on the ball. You've got to hit the ball way
over the fence to get it by him.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Piazza said, is not letting Jones get under your
skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't want to change your approach (at the
plate),'' Piazza said. ``It's more your attitude. If you hit a good
ball, and he catches it and makes it look easy, you can't get
upset.''

 &HT;    New faces give Cox flexible batting order
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since 1996, Bobby Cox has devised a new lineup almost
every other game. Do not be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The 256 different batting orders the Braves have used during the
last three seasons reflect the least change of any club in the
majors. Some of that stems from a high level of performance (a
major-league best .624 winning percentage) that has made
experimentation unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects Cox's comfort with his starting core, a
trait that endears him to most Braves, at least those who play
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox's comfort zone took a hit this season. Not only has
Andres Galarraga's absence meant a 15.2 percent loss in RBIs, but
Cox also will be starting three new regulars _ Bret Boone, Brian
Jordan and Otis Nixon _ who are critical to the club's offensive
performance.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the National League is curious about changes in
the Braves' starting rotation, how the club comes together at the
plate is surely topic 1-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got enough depth on this team to hold us,'' Jordan said.
``Roles change. You can use a lot of these guys in four or five
different spots in the order, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Galarraga's cancer diagnosis rocked the franchise, the
Braves could not have prepared much better had they known months in
advance. Signing Jordan provided a new cleanup hitter. The Boone
trade brought the best power numbers (24 homers, 95 RBIs) by any
Braves second baseman in a quarter-century. Nixon is the
prototypical leadoff hitter the club lacked last season.
</P>
<P>
   A bench including Keith Lockhart, Gerald Williams and Ozzie
Guillen is now stocked with tough outs. Originally devised to
improve the team at second base and left and right fields, where
Cox was forced to platoon in 1998, the winter moves now work to
fill in for Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with Montreal, Boston, the Dodgers,'' Nixon said.
``I've been with Texas and Boston, Toronto, and this is the most
balanced team. There are more things (Cox) can do with this ball
club than any I've been on.''
</P>
<P>
   After last year's historic production (215 homers, 297 doubles,
2,483 total bases, .453 slugging percentage, all franchise
records), the Braves would have been hard-pressed to duplicate
those numbers with a healthy Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like having made those moves and then losing Cat,
we just kind of subtracted a lot of what those guys can do,''
Chipper Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is how the Braves will deploy the talent.
Besides Nixon hitting first and Chipper Jones hitting third, Cox
has a new versatility throughout his roster, which was the original
goal when general manager John Schuerholz first began discussing
options in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look up and down the lineup,'' Boone said. ``I still think
we're as good as anyone in baseball without (Galarraga). With him,
it's just phenomenal. But you can't replace him, nor should we get
ourselves saying we're going to replace him. And if you look at the
numbers up and down the lineup, we're as good as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves can use Boone, Andruw Jones or Walt Weiss to hit
behind Nixon. Chipper Jones, Jordan, Ryan Klesko and Javy Lopez,
who fill out the middle of the order, hit .291 with runners in
scoring position last season. Jordan even suggested a No. 8 hitter
on this team could drive in 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   But if the 1998 Braves were driven by power, the 1999 Braves
will have to be more resourceful than that. Cox probably has more
offensive options than on any other Braves team he's managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a luxury for a manager but you need that,'' Nixon said.
``It's rare to find it. I think the Yankees were in that situation
the last couple years, with what they could do with the infield and
outfield. It was an overabundance, what they had up there. But you
see the same thing here. It's a must for a manager.

 &HT;    Braves mount a younger pitching rotation
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The news came to him in Japan during a November
all-star tour. Kevin Millwood, halfway around the world, found
himself a central part of the Atlanta Braves' new plan.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle was gone, and Millwood no longer was the curio
snatched from the depths of the minor-league system just 16 months
before. Not only was he Neagle's replacement, Millwood found
himself part of an amended Braves formula to get the club back into
another World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I thought,'' Millwood said. ``I think at the
end of the season last year everybody knew something was going to
happen, and it kind of (hurts) to see a guy like (Neagle) go, who
pitched well for us and did a good job. But at the same time, it
helped me out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood and 20-year-old rookie Odalis Perez assume the jobs as
fourth and fifth starters for the same team that had preached all
decade that there is no such thing as too much starting pitching.
Neagle, who left Atlanta with a .667 winning percentage, also took
the remaining two years of his contract, valued at $9.5 million, to
the Reds, clearing some payroll space for newcomers Bret Boone and
Brian Jordan, who will make a combined $9.9 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   While financially logical, the move represents a huge leap of
faith for the Braves, who have a grand total of 37 major-league
starts from their fourth starter and none from their fifth. Bruce
Chen, who started four games late last year, struggled during much
of the spring as the fifth starter, and Perez won the job, at least
as camp closed. It has become apparent the team doesn't really have
a plan B if the new rotation doesn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many plans you're allowed when you're
putting together a club,'' general manager John Schuerholz said.
``You do what you think is the best thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Millwood's promotion appears to be a no-brainer.
His 17 wins last year tied teammate John Smoltz, New York's Al
Leiter and San Diego's Andy Ashby for sixth-most in the National
League. His .656 career win percentage as a starter (21-11) rivals
Neagle as a Brave and far surpasses both Tom Glavine and Greg
Maddux at the same points in their careers, when they were a
combined 18 games under .500 after their first full years in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Millwood was hit hard in 1998, giving up
175 hits in 174 1/3 innings. He averaged 3.9 pitches per at-bat,
fourth-highest among NL starters, and was the beneficiary of a
hefty 5.1 runs per start in support. After a 7-1 start over his
first 10 appearances, Millwood went 10-7 in the last four months,
despite posting a 3.73 ERA after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing last year was I got off to a good
start,'' Millwood said. ``In the minor leagues every year, I was
struggling early in the season and would not pitch real well. The
beginning of the season last year was probably the key to my whole
year. I got some confidence built up, and it just kind of
ballooned.''
</P>
<P>
   While Millwood has encountered success in the majors, Perez's
promotion is based almost entirely on potential and his spring
showing. The team is investing heavily in a rookie who pitched 10
2/3 innings in 10 September games last season and has gone 16-18
with a 2.95 ERA in 94 career minor-league games, 39 of them starts.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, the youngest player to debut last season and a member of
the Braves' postseason roster, led Atlanta in strikeouts this
spring. But even with Perez claiming his spot in Atlanta,
management will not waver on the timing of Neagle's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the emergence of Millwood last year winning 17 games and
with Chen and Perez right on the brink,'' Schuerholz said, ``it was
easier for us to consider making a move like that, where we took
the giant step, trading a high-caliber fourth starter to allow us
the opportunity to add another offensive player. We had never been
in a position like that before, where we had guys who were that
developed and capable, in our view, on the horizon that would allow
us to make this bold move.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of that boldness has not been measured fully yet.

 &HT;    Braves not panicking about the pen
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The whirlwind tour that has been the Braves' bullpen
for the past decade is expected to continue during the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Seven different relievers have led the team in saves during the
last nine seasons _ Joe Boever, Juan Berenguer, Alejandro Pena,
Mike Stanton, Greg McMichael, Mark Wohlers and Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who led Atlanta in saves in 1995-1997, emerges from
spring training as the Braves' closer, but he remains a question
mark after a disastrous 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Wohlers situation became crucial with the loss of
Ligtenberg, who recorded 30 saves last year and became the first
rookie since Todd Worrell in 1986 to lead the National League.
Ligtenberg is out for the season with an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Braves are not panicking.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that has found answers riding into camp on a
motorcycle (Mike Bielecki), buried on the list of nonroster
invitees to spring training (McMichael) and toiling away in the
independent Prairie League (Ligtenberg).
</P>
<P>
   There is another big reason why the Braves haven't taken any
drastic measures _ John Rocker appears ready to step into the
closer's role if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your two options are a right-hander who had 100 saves in
three years, and he throws 95-100, or a left-hander who does about
the same thing without the experience, I think you've got two good
choices to go to,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also have Rudy Seanez and Mike Cather, both proven
setup pitchers. Cather has recovered from rib-extraction surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Remlinger has shown glimpses of the control
problems that cost him last year in Cincinnati, but he has been
dominating at times during the spring. The Braves can use him for
spot starts and veteran leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to have a real good bullpen,'' said pitching
coach Leo Mazzone, who conceded that Ligtenberg's loss will hurt.
``Our bullpen's been great this whole run. Sometimes they get in a
tough spot, and the reason for that is because they're coming
behind a very high standard of excellence that's been set by the
rotation, so every slip-up gets magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're satisfied with what we've seen,'' Braves
general manager John Schuerholz said. ``John Rocker's throwing the
ball well, and Mark really looks like he's close to being back.
Rudy Seanez did a great job for us last year. Remlinger has not
closed, but he's thrown the ball well in relief, so we're going to
be OK with our relief pitching.

 &HT;    A hit with the Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don Baylor says he has been in uncomfortable
positions, but working as a hitting coach for Braves manager Bobby
Cox is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys are comfortable with their own situation, there's
absolutely no problem,'' Baylor said. ``He's managing like I tried
to do. When I brought guys in as coaches, you let them do their
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was bitter after being fired last season by the Colorado
Rockies after taking an expansion team to the playoffs during three
of his six years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just confused more than anything,'' Baylor said. ``They
gave me a chance to manage and I did exactly that. I took a team to
heights they'd never been to before. ... But a manager can only do
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Seale is a man who knew Baylor when he had so many reasons
to feel uncomfortable, not to mention feel bitter. So he knows the
difference. From Seale's perspective, Baylor is going to thrive in
his new situation, and so are the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Seale has been a part of Baylor's life since the hard-working
Baylor first learned how to be confident in the face of rejection,
comfortable with who he is, thankful for his opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Seale became Baylor's baseball coach at Stephen F. Austin High
School in Austin, Texas, in the 1960s, two years after Baylor
volunteered to become one of several black students to integrate
the all-white school. Seale didn't coach the baseball team until
Baylor's junior year, but he watched the team play during Baylor's
sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   And there sat Baylor, the first black athlete in Stephen F.
Austin's history, on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The man who would become an American League MVP with the Angels
in 1979, who would play on three consecutive World Series teams
with the Red Sox, Twins, and A's in 1986-88, who would become the
sixth black manager in the history of major league baseball for the
Rockies in 1992, was being benched because of his color.
</P>
<P>
   When Seale took over the team the following year, not only did
he let Baylor play, he named him a captain. He did so against the
wishes of many parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a little flak for that,'' Seale said. ``I didn't
really care. In my mind, he was the person who deserved it. ...
That was when being a captain wasn't just a name or a star on a
letter jacket; it really meant something.''
</P>
<P>
   Seale sees those same leadership qualities in Baylor now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had an outstanding career in high school and pro ball,
but the thing I admire most about him is the way he handled himself
through all of it, the way he still handles himself,'' Seale said.
``He's an excellent role model for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why Baylor will end up a manager in baseball again. It may
be why some people think Baylor was brought to Atlanta as a manager
in waiting after the Braves' repeated postseason disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   But Braves general manager John Schuerholz shoots down those
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are false; they are absolutely false,'' Schuerholz said.
``That's silly. Don had a fine run as a manager, but we hired him
because he's a good hitting coach. We're not looking to find
somebody who's a replacement for our manager. We're looking for
somebody to be the best hitting coach we could get, and I think we
got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he never felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never crossed my mind,'' Cox said. ``And if somebody has
to take over for me, I'd be proud if they came from our own staff.
I've always had good coaches. All of them are capable of managing
in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were in the midst of a miserable offensive slump in
the National League Championship Series last October, when
Schuerholz asked Baylor at a major league baseball party if he had
any interest in coaching for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor still had an offer from the Rockies to work in their
front office, so he took a month after the NLCS to figure out his
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I cleared the decks right here,'' Baylor said pointing to
his heart, ``I was fine with it. I knew it was time to sever that,
and I never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor turned down offers to coach in Seattle, Oakland and
Cleveland to join the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring into his decision was his friendship with Schuerholz,
who signed Baylor to the Baltimore Orioles farm system when Baylor
was 17.
</P>
<P>
   There was his desire to stay in the National League. There was
the Braves penchant for winning and a chance to return to the World
Series. There was the exposure that comes with that. And there was
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the best situation for me,'' Baylor said.
``I've respected Bobby for years. People who played for him always
said the same things about him and that's hard in our business _
how consistent he is, how he's a great guy to play for, good guy to
work for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves want Baylor to develop Ryan Klesko into a run
producer, to take Andruw Jones to the next level, to breathe life
into an offense that has gone into hibernation each of the last two
Octobers.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has a reputation as one of the best hitting coaches in
baseball. He has revived the careers of Andres Galarraga and Vinny
Castilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody respects him so much,'' said Walt Weiss, who played
with Baylor in Oakland and for him in Colorado. ``He has that
presence. He has that air about him. Even in Oakland. We had a lot
of characters on that team, some pretty big egos, but when he
spoke, people definitely stopped talking. Even as a player, he was
almost like a father-figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor seems already to have had a positive impact on Klesko.
The Braves lineup has looked potent at times, despite the loss of
Galarraga. And optimism is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew (Baylor) was a hard-worker, so I'm not surprised to see
that,'' Schuerholz said. ``I knew he was an intelligent and
knowledgable baseball hitting practitioner, and I'm not surprised
by that. I knew that he was a dedicated and spirited worker and I'm
not surprised by that. So the fact that the players are all saying
the same things is the highest praise of all, because that's who he
has to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz's biggest fear is that another team will need a
manager this season and recruit Baylor. Baylor's agreement with the
Braves allows him to leave without penalty if he's offered a
manager's job. That was a chance the Braves were willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it happens; God bless him, he deserves it,''
Schuerholz said. ``He's established himself as a major league
manager and did a fine job at it. If somebody comes and wants him
to be a manager, I wouldn't be surprised, and I'd wish him well.
I'd hate to lose him.''
</P>
<P>
   While working with hitters is natural for Baylor, he still wants
to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure of managing was an awesome experience,'' Baylor
said. ``You put on a squeeze and nobody in the ballpark knows
except three people. That's the fun of it.... But I'm having fun
doing what I'm doing. I enjoy working one-on-one with these guys
here. If that time comes again, it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's comfortable.

 &HT;    Jordan excels at football but opts for security, longevity of
baseball
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those who have watched Braves outfielder Brian Jordan
the closest during the years say they always have noticed his inner
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The kind that would have Jordan, the baseball player, busting
into an outfield wall with abandon. The kind that took Jordan, the
football player, from injured outcast status as a rookie with the
Buffalo Bills to a backup job at strong safety for the Atlanta
Falcons by the end of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The kind that had former St. Louis Cardinals general manager Dal
Maxvill extending a $2.4 million contract offer to an outfielder
whose pro baseball career consisted of only 116 minor-league games
in four seasons. The kind that made former Falcons coach Jerry
Glanville crazy about a strong safety from a small school who hit
and played hard.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of inner drive that had Jordan, as an
18-year-old kid from Baltimore, turning and leaving coach Bobby
Ross's office on college football's national signing day after Ross
told him if he wanted to play football for the University of
Maryland, he would have to give up playing baseball his freshman
year.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of drive that six months later had Jordan inches from
his father's face, pointing at his forehead, after Alvin Jordan
called his youngest son a wimp.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of drive that eventually led Jordan to one of
the biggest decisions of his life _ turning his back on a solid NFL
career to become the best professional baseball player he could be.
</P>
<P>
   The preparation
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it would seem easy to figure out where some of
that drive comes from in Jordan to not only survive but succeed in
two professional sports. The first place to look is in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Brian had just come home from playing in a high school all-star
football game one summer night in 1985. Alvin Jordan had been home
from the game for a while. He was standing at the kitchen sink
doing the dishes when Brian came home.
</P>
<P>
   Brian was still sore, mentally and physically, from losing the
game. He hadn't practiced all week because of muscle spasms in his
back but insisted on playing anyway. He had been taped up tight and
played stiff. He got away with it until late in the game when a
burly running back came up the middle toward Jordan, who was
playing safety. Instead of tackling him high like he normally
would, Jordan went in low hoping to avoid some pain. But the back
tumbled over Jordan and into the end zone for the game-winning
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   That was the play Alvin Jordan was thinking about when he said
just one word to his son as he walked through the door: ``Wimp.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after Jordan's older sister Felicia dragged him downstairs
to cool off, did son and father avoid more than a heated exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I was thinking, 'What the hell does he want?'''
Brian Jordan said. ``It took a couple days before I went down and
finally apologized to him. He said, 'Hey, that's the attitude I
want you to take to college with you.' I knew then it was a setup
just to make me tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Jordan said, ``I wanted him to know when he got to
college, there would be someone who would holler out of the stands
and would make him mad. He'd have to learn how to control his
emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and his father were both emotional about football. Alvin
Jordan was thought of as a great athlete in his own day, but he has
little more than neighborhood lore to back him up. The closest he
came to playing college sports was a rumor that he'd get to tryout
with the University of Michigan after one of their alumni saw him
play football on an army base in Korea. But when he got back to the
United States there was no tryout, possibly, Jordan thinks, because
he was married.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Jordan likes to think her husband chose love over sports.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan made a pact to himself that he wouldn't have to
make such a choice. Whatever sport his father couldn't play, Jordan
was going to make sure he played that one, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur years
</P>
<P>
   At Millford Mill Academy in Baltimore, Jordan was captain of the
football team, captain of the basketball team and captain of the
baseball team. He emerged as an all-star in football and baseball
and decided to pursue both in college.
</P>
<P>
   Not many schools were willing to let Jordan play two sports, but
Division I-AA University of Richmond would. So after his
disappointing news that Ross didn't want him to play baseball at
Maryland his first year, Jordan signed with Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   He made all-conference in football and baseball. He was a
Division I-AA All-American in football, but it was pro baseball
that came calling first. After his junior year, Jordan was drafted
by the Cardinals as a supplemental pick between the first and
second rounds. They wanted him to leave school, give up football
and start rookie ball. After some lengthy negotiations, Jordan took
nearly $50,000 less of a signing bonus, so that he could return to
school after his rookie-league season, play another year of
football and graduate.
</P>
<P>
   After his senior year in 1989, Jordan was taken in the seventh
round of the NFL draft. He would have gone much higher, but he had
broken an ankle in the Senior Bowl all-star game in Mobile, Ala.
The Bills released Jordan, thinking there was no way he'd come back
that season from the injury, but the Falcons picked him up, let him
heal and put him in the defensive backfield, where he started in
1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The big decision
</P>
<P>
   Watching Jordan play for the Falcons on Sundays used to make
Maxvill miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sit there and cringe when he'd slam into a 240-pound
fullback,'' said Maxvill, who is retired from baseball. ``I'd have
to turn the TV off.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan's contract with the Falcons expired after the 1991
season, Jordan, his wife, Pam, and his parents wanted him to
continue playing football. The Cardinals did not. They made him an
offer to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan asked the Falcons for around $1 million a year, but the
Falcons responded with half that amount. Jim Hay, the Falcons'
chief financial officer, said the Falcons couldn't justify paying
that type of money to a third-year player. The Cardinals, on the
other hand, were willing to pay Jordan $2.4 million for three
years, guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My dad) wanted me to wait instead of signing a baseball
contract,'' Jordan said. ``But kids, married, young, a chance to
help my parents, too _ I was just thinking about who I could help.
... Security is the key. Longevity is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   It was practically unheard of at that time to pay a
minor-leaguer that kind of money, but it made sense to the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides some raw, very raw natural ability with the bat,
glove, arm and legs, there was an internal desire,'' Maxvill said.
``A will to overcome anything to achieve, not just a big-league
career but beyond that. It was easy to sense he was special that
way. ... We had the foresight to draft him, pay him, keep him out
of football, and there's pride in that. Besides, you like to see
good guys do well. And he's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan played his last professional football game in January
1992, when the Falcons played the Redskins in the playoffs. He made
his major-league debut with the Cardinals later that same year
after Andres Galarraga broke his wrist. But it wasn't until June
1993 that Jordan secured his place in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, especially when you're bouncing back from AAA to
the big leagues, missing all your buddies on the football field;
(the Falcons) were moving into a new dome,'' Jordan said. ``Man, I
didn't get a chance to play in that dome. So it was eating me up
there for a bit. But it was another challenge, because I hadn't
given baseball a true shot yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The present
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's another Galarraga health problem, this time
cancer, that brings Jordan into the spotlight. The Braves' move to
sign him during the offseason got that much more important after
Galarraga was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who will bat cleanup in Galarraga's spot, comes into the
season with a five-year, $40 million contract and peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   He just bought a second home in Orlando, Fla., where his parents
can enjoy retirement by escaping the Baltimore winters, his kids
can enjoy a swimming pool and nearby Disney World, and Jordan can
live a short ride from the Braves ballpark during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's last flirtation with football came with the Oakland
Raiders, but once again the Cardinals won out, signing Jordan to
his previous contract worth $12 million. Jordan admits he still
itches to play football from time to time _ he joked that he was
hoping Falcons coach Dan Reeves would call for his help for the
Super Bowl _ but said his future is baseball. And that's enough of
a challenge for Jordan, who's always found baseball harder than
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is straight ahead, smashmouth,'' Jordan said.
``Baseball is being patient and adjusting to a ball that's moving
every which way. It's a never-ending learning process for me. Not
playing in those minor-league games like everybody else, I'm still
catching up, still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jordan has learned much more than how to hit a
curveball, how to take full advantage of his opportunities and how
to be tough. He learned that he made decisions a lot like his
father after all, because in the end, he put his family first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss that (two-sport) challenge; I do,'' Jordan said. ``But
I have a new challenge of raising my kids, and that's a big reason
why I limited myself to one sport. I wanted to spend time with them
and be the daddy I know I can be for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The future
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that the horsing around gets a
little rowdy sometimes in the Jordan household when the former
Falcon plays a little ``football'' with his 5-year old son, Bryson.
And yes, every now and then Dad will get a little rough and Bryson
will cry, and then Dad will smile and nudge him and tell him he
just has to be tougher. Then Bryson will get up and fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said baseball is his son's best sport. As a 4-year-old,
Bryson was bumped from T-ball into coach-pitch.
</P>
<P>
   So if Bryson decides he wants to follow in his father's
footsteps and play both football and baseball when he grows up,
will he have his father's blessing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he'd just want to be a doctor,'' Jordan said with a
smile.

 &HT;    Spanish flavors Braves' beisbol success
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There has been no grand design, particularly given how
some of the components arrived at random. While the Atlanta Braves
have been linked for the ages with starting pitching, while Chipper
Jones banks the endorsement checks, while Bobby Cox rubs his skull
nightly over the global uplink, something else has happened as
important to this franchise's fate as Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves quietly have become one of the game's most Latin
America-oriented teams, and not only in the major league clubhouse
where Javy Lopez and Andruw Jones play out nightly roles. Beneath
them in the minor league system, 43 percent of the players on the
Braves register (93 players out of 217) have been signed out of 10
Caribbean, Central American and South American countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's that amazing, up against the development of
baseball in the Latin countries and the ever-increasing number of
Latin players on other rosters,'' general manager John Schuerholz
said. ``I think our increased numbers are pretty consistent with
what's happened in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Where some major league clubs have two or three
Latin players on their entire 40-man rosters, the Braves will open
the season with six on the opening day 25-man roster. And that's
not counting Venezuelan giant Andres Galarraga, who towers over the
Braves' Latin contingent from his home in West Palm Beach, Fla.,
where he continues cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Ozzie Guillen took his first look around the club's
Turner Field quarters and said, ``We're the Caracas Braves now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for all of them, because I know where they came
from,'' said Lopez, who took batting practice as a kid in Ponce,
Puerto Rico, using a stick and a pile of rocks. ``I don't know
exactly everything about them, but I know most of them came from a
very poor family. If they're up trying to make it here, that's a
good sign for them, because then they can change their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Lopez on the projected opening roster are Odalis Perez,
Guillen (Venezuela), Randall Simon (Curacao), Jones (Curacao) and
Eddie Perez (Venezuela). But the 40-man roster also includes
pitchers Bruce Chen (Panama), Luis Rivera (Mexico) and Ismael
Villegas (Puerto Rico), catchers Fernando Lunar (Venezuela) and
Pascual Matos (Dominican). Add Galarraga and there are 12 Latins on
the 40-man, third only to the Cleveland Indians with 14 and the
Marlins and Expos with 13 each. No team has more than the six
nations represented on the Braves' 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most I've seen on one team,'' said dugout coach
Pat Corrales, entering his 41st season. ``I had a lot of Latins
(while managing) in Philadelphia (1982-83) but nothing like we have
here. That shows the interest they're created down there. This is a
good mix.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's more than good. The way Eddie Perez sees it, his
life's quest is over at age 30. He once played with Venezuelan
legend Davey Concepcion in winter ball and now has played with
legends Guillen and Galarraga and Lopez, a two-time All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first goal since I was playing baseball is make it to the
big leagues,'' Perez said. ``I make it to the big leagues and the
same year (1995), we won the World Series. That's all I was
striving for. And now they have these three guys here, what else do
I want?''
</P>
<P>
   While Galarraga and Guillen joined the club as free agents, the
rest of the crop came through scouting and was developed by the
Braves. Where in 1975 the team had one Dominican-based scout
responsible also for Venezuela and Puerto Rico, the team now has
eight scouts (seven part-time) in Venezuela alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've expanded,'' said Paul Snyder, scouting and development
director. ``This is really an area where you need a street-smart
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A global television station doesn't hurt either. Once the club
began to extend its scouting network at the start of the decade, it
quickly became clear WTBS had been recruiting potential Braves for
more than a decade. If the Los Angeles Dodgers were for years
considered the reigning power in finding Spanish-speaking talent,
the Braves were able to influence the market quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in '91, it used to be I'd come to a field, the
Braves were already known,'' said Giovanni Viceisza, the
Curacao-based scout who found and signed Andruw Jones. He has since
become an agent. ``It was this team they would see every day on TV.
As a scout, that helps you a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were kids that weren't even asking for money, as long as
they signed with the Braves. I had one kid say he'd sign for one
dollar if it's with the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves were really the only team that actually scouted
me,'' Chen said. ``There were other scouts but they never
approached me. The Braves were the first team to actually pursue
me. At that time, the Braves had just gone from last to first and
they were a real big thing in Panama. I was happy to sign with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That eagerness to please still shows in Atlanta, where the
team's Latin contingent can dominate the clubhouse. If the Braves
are still viewed as a passionless collection of buttoned-down
personalities, no one told Guillen, whose mouth has seemingly been
open since he arrived last May after his release in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to help each other,'' Guillen said. ``I'm the
one who played the most with anyone, and I think it's amazing. Some
other teams, one Latin guy doesn't get along with another one.
Here, these guys all get along. They're really close.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves will still be measured by how far the starting
pitching can take them, there is another story being told in
Spanish. In many ways, it is just as interesting as anything that
appears in the daily standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning where I first got here (in 1992) to now,
this is a totally different team, man,'' Lopez said. ``Even though
we don't have a complete success (in October), at least we have a
success in the clubhouse. That's what I've liked to see.

 &HT;    Braves clubhouse is happily multicultural
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bruce Chen, Panamanian-born of Chinese parents and a
high school honors student on the side, walked into the Braves
major-league clubhouse for the first time last spring, a stranger
in a strange land.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie, like most, got a quick education.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come in and you just feel comfortable,'' Chen said. ``You
see the other guys from Spanish-speaking countries, and I think
it's part of the success Javy Lopez and Eddie Perez have had,
opening the doors for other Latin American players.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not half the story, that the Braves have assembled one of
the largest Latin American populations in any major league
clubhouse. They have also built a support group, a nuclear family
that has become a central pillar to the entire club.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Latin guys, we always try to make everybody feel like
a family,'' said Javy Lopez, who has spent more seasons (five) in
the Braves clubhouse than any current Latin American player.
``Because I don't think any team can have any success if they don't
feel that we're a family. If we're treated different, I don't think
the team is going to play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we all try to get along with each other and try to become
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But they often are nations apart. While most American-born
Braves prefer golf, fishing and playing cards, the Latin contingent
is different. The 1998 World Cup became a festival played out over
a clubhouse television. (Ozzie Guillen wore a green-and-yellow
bracelet to honor mighty Brazil.) They rely on each other, common
among foreign major league players, but the Braves' bond seems to
go beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like one guy goes out with this guy every day,''
Lopez said. ``We all go out together, like to clubs or bars or
stuff like that. They all go _ Latins, Americans, black and white.
We're like that. That's why they've had a lot of success. There's
no racism on this team, no nothing. That's what I like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   This collection is no random event, given the club's improved
scouting system. The pipeline is primed. Mexican Luis Rivera, 20,
throws a 97 mph fastball (228 strikeouts in 179 career innings) and
although he has been used almost exclusively as a starter, he could
convert to closing. Rafael Furcal of the Dominican Republic is the
most exciting infielder to come from the system in years. Furcal
hit .328 at Class A Danville last summer, with 38 doubles and 60
steals in 66 games.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable how strong a clubhouse bond has been struck,
for factionalism among Latin players is nothing new to the majors.
While the Big Red Machine was a model for Pan American relations _
Cuban Tony Perez, Venezuelan Davey Concepcion and Dominicans Cesar
Geronimo and Pedro Borbon _ some mixes are not so smooth. Texas'
Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez played on the same Puerto Rican
Little League team, but their relationship hardly fosters warmth in
the Rangers' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But even without Galarraga _ he is a father figure to Latin
players throughout the league _ the Braves are a team transformed.
In the 1991 World Series, the same franchise featured Rafael
Belliard, Francisco Cabrera and Alejandro Pena. Missing Galarraga
in 1999, the Braves remain Las America's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andres is the guy everybody respects,'' Lopez said.
``Everywhere we go, he's a big man in this game.

 &HT;    A challenge adjusting to a new land
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Bruce Chen was 16 years old, playing in the
Braves' minor-league system in West Palm Beach, Fla., he had a lot
to learn. And not necessarily about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Living away from his family in Panama City, Panama, Chen had
never made his own bed, washed his own clothes or cooked. He hadn't
handled his own money or learned to drive. But the biggest barrier
was the language. The Spanish-speaking Chen hadn't spoken English
outside of a few classes in school.
</P>
<P>
   He already knew terms like hit-and-run and squeeze, since they
carry over in Latin American baseball. But Chen, who took classes
at a local Florida school while playing baseball in the Gulf Coast
League, had to go to his English teacher to find out what
``attaboy'' meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was something good,'' said Chen, who laughs about it
now.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen, Andruw Jones, Odalis Perez and many other young Latin
major-leaguers had to grow up fast, learn the game and adapt to a
new culture.
</P>
<P>
   They turn to each other for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be the first one to break down and say, `Oh,
I miss my family,''' Chen said. ``Plus, we were playing baseball,
something we loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was a haven. There were always other Latin players and
Spanish-speaking coaches. Communicating off the field was much
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't talk at all my first year, unless it was
necessary,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   American players would laugh when Chen said ``peeksa'' instead
of ``pizza.'' But by his third year in the organization, Chen was
the player coaches and media turned to when they needed
translations from other Latin players.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a Dominican Republic native who came to the United States
to play for the Braves when he was 16, said Chen helped him learn
better English by encouraging him to go to restaurants and ordering
American food.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who had taken several years of English in school, also
relied on an American teammate who spoke some Spanish. He would
have his teammate talk to him in Spanish, and he'd respond in
English. If he didn't get the words right, his teammate would
correct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if I want to progress and play in a different league
every year, I need to learn the language,'' Perez said. ``I think
I've been moving up so quick, because they know. I'm not saying I
speak very good English, but I try to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to American food also was tough for Perez and other
Latin players. When he couldn't find Latin restaurants, he would
eat with his American teammates and order what they ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said when he first got to the United States he ate a lot
of fast food, because he wasn't used to the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can eat it because I know what it is; I tasted it
before,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was ahead of his Latin teammates with language, because in
his native Curacao, they speak Papiamento, which is a blend of
Spanish, English and Dutch. But he wasn't as comfortable speaking
English as Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know English, but I was afraid to speak,'' Jones said. ``But
being around people and hearing them talking, it started getting
better. It's like baseball, every year you go, you learn something.
You get better.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chen, Perez and Jones, getting used to American life has
been a small price to pay for a career in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I dreamed since I was little,'' Jones said. ``I
had the chance, and I never thought twice about the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen will begin the 1999 season in Richmond. During the
offseason, he attends Georgia Tech, where he's a dean's list
student in civil engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still adjusting, but I feel real comfortable now,'' Chen
said. ``I know I can go anywhere. I don't feel like I'm missing
something.

 &HT;    State of the game: Recovering but uneasy
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At some point last summer, someone _ George Will? Cuba
Gooding Jr.? Ozzie Guillen? _ declared that baseball was back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, duh.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were escorting America through some
of the game's most dramatic moments on a nightly basis. Major
league attendance surpassed a record 70.5 million. A New York team
was at the forefront, an unwritten must for the national marketing
and advertising crowd. Kerry Wood, David Wells, Cal Ripken Jr., Ken
Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Tom Glavine and dozens of other stars
provided reason every single day to follow this game.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball had not finally purged itself of the 1994-95 players
strike, the canvas was pretty well hosed down. There was at last
talk of the future for a game that had been living in a very wicked
short-term past.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the strike years, sometimes you were a little bit
embarrassed about doing what you do,'' Atlanta's Greg Maddux said.
``Now that the sting from that is gone, maybe you just take a
little more pride in your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet all the pride in the majors cannot correct the host of
fundamental problems that still plague baseball, problems that not
only were not addressed in 1998 but that have been fermenting since
the dawn of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is not back. All the sport got was a vitamin B-12 shot.
</P>
<P>
   The game has never been less competitive, with half the
franchises eliminated on Opening Day by a financial structure that
strangles fair play. The advent of the game's first $100-million
man underscores the inequities of a system that allows the Fox
corporation behind the Los Angeles Dodgers to pay Kevin Brown a
record $15 million this season. One player in 1999 will earn more
than the entire payroll that 11 teams were paying out in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ask about the biggest issues facing baseball, and Braves
president Stan Kasten will give you two:
</P>
<P>
   ``The game today is captivating with new stars on the horizon,
with new stadiums and arenas,'' Kasten said. ``We just have to keep
that up. For decades, we've been able to continue to increase
exposure and thereby increase revenue. Revenue growth has been
steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side, which I really don't like to talk about
publicly, is the economics of the business of the game, which are
disastrous. Any word less than that is putting your head in the
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' side doesn't seem comfortable with the current
course either. The financial inequities in the industry are
fundamentally identical to 1994, when the Players Association
conducted its ruinous strike. The basic work agreement expires in
2001, and some players already hear grim music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared to death to see what happens after 2001,'' McGwire
said. ``If we have a work stoppage in 2001, I'll be so disgusted
I'd walk away from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the public interest statistics, baseball's best barometer,
are suspect. While attendance increased last year, 5.9 million new
fans were counted by first-year franchises in Arizona and Tampa
Bay. Remove those two clubs from the equation, and baseball
attendance rose 2.7 percent, a contradiction to what was regarded
as one of the most exciting seasons of the century. Attendance had
increased 4.9 percent in 1997 without the benefit of McGwire and
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   TV ratings of the New York Yankees-San Diego Padres World Series
were the lowest in history, coming on the heels of the 1997
Florida-Cleveland Series that would have been the worst on record
until it was saved by a dramatic seventh game. New York's sweep
last October wound up costing Fox $15 million, despite the presence
of big-draw Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   This draws a picture of a distracted fan, not the same one
thought to be hustling back through the turnstile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fan has two things: hope and faith,'' commissioner Bud
Selig said. ``It's my job to create as much hope and faith in as
many places as possible. So I have my work cut out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ownership has shown its faith and hope during the 1990s with
brick and structural steel. Seven new stadiums have been
constructed this decade; three more parks have been extensively
refurbished, and eight other franchises (San Diego, Seattle, San
Francisco, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Houston, Cincinnati and Milwaukee)
either have new parks under construction or planned. It is
important that six of those new facilities are being erected in
small-market cities, the strongest indication owners can give that
there is a future.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the richer teams have upped high-stakes games in
the back room for those serious about making the World Series. The
minimum payroll for a winning team in 1998 was the $38.3 million
spent by Toronto. Eleven teams _ more than a third of the major
leagues _ could not spend so much, and none of them finished closer
than 14 games from their division champion. All eight teams that
reached the postseason were within the top 12 in the payroll
standings, with the exception of Baltimore, which led the majors
with a $75.2 payroll and finished with a 79-83 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Study Committee, conceived to cure these ills, met
in March. When member John McHale, president of the Detroit Tigers,
was asked about isolating the trouble, he replied, ``It's no secret
what the problems are. The inequities among the clubs is the whole
top-10 list of short-term problems in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to fix this,'' Kansas City general manager Herk
Robinson said. ``I think people around baseball understand the
problem. There are a bunch of teams out there, us included, that
simply cannot compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitiveness has actually become a geographic phenomenon.
Nine of the top 10 payrolls in 1998 belonged to teams in eastern or
western divisions, and if baseball is a game of the hinterlands, it
has found a strange way of showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For baseball to succeed, it needs to succeed in middle
America,'' said Selig, acutely aware of the problems as the
Brewers' former owner. ``Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Kansas
City, St. Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh _ that's the focus
of my job. It needs to succeed in those places. It needs to have
the chance it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   But then it would also need the cooperation of players. The kind
of revenue-sharing and salary control that has fostered competitive
balance in the NBA and NFL continues to be opposed by the Players
Association, which works behind the scenes every winter to inflate
the free-agent market. Where the league office wants to view member
cities all as World Series contenders, the union still sees a
collection of investors, some with portfolios less than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the prices are higher,'' said Atlanta's Tom
Glavine, the NL's players representative. ``You can't expect to buy
a franchise for a third of the price of the Yankees and expect to
make the same kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely where the new 1995 basic agreement left the
issue, and financial disparity has only grown worse since. Yet at
the same time, there is a growing sense that the union, at last, is
heading for a fall. The damage done by the last strike and a
growing economic imperative have altered negotiating positions, and
some already see a shift in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see some marquee names become
available for a discount in the next few years from clubs that got
out there a little too far,'' Philadelphia Phillies general manager
Ed Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are a prime example of a financial system out of
whack _ a big-market team that, for reasons not all its own, finds
itself at the bottom of the pile. Wade is cutting $3 million in
payroll this year to a projected $25.9 million total, almost what
the Braves will pay Glavine, Maddux and John Smoltz this season
($25.75 million). Weary of the money-grubber accusations, some
players are preaching financial reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agents out there today who want to get every last cent
out of a team,'' McGwire said. ``My theory is this: the agents work
for the player; the player doesn't work for the agent. Players
should stand up and say, 'Enough is enough.' You don't have to get
every last cent.''
</P>
<P>
   This amounts to sedition at the Player Association offices, but
because it's the new home run king talking, the union realizes its
ranks are looser than in the early 1990s. Financial compromise
appears more possible, if only because the union's lone weapon _the
labor action _ is nearly as repulsive in the clubhouse as in the
front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any player wants to go through (a strike)
again,'' Atlanta's Mark Wohlers said. ``I think for the players,
for the most part, once is enough. I sacrificed what I needed to
do. Obviously my tune might change further down the line. I'll
always stand strong with the union. But I think everyone is smart
enough _ the union and the owners _ to know we just can't afford
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has come so far in such a short amount of time since
the strike, you just can't jeopardize what all of us have built
over the last three or fours years. Baseball just can't afford
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, baseball embarks on another season of inequity.
While the high-rolling Braves and Yankees already have their
tickets punched for October, the other half dresses for Opening Day
knowing the schedule is only a cruel formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's skewed for those who are going to spend money,''
Brewers manager Phil Garner said. ``When it's all over and said and
done, we might look back and say, `Well, gee whiz, Minnesota never
had a chance. Or Milwaukee never had a chance, or Kansas City or
Pittsburgh.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We may look back and say that. But the truth of the matter is
that there is a possibility that lurks out there that we may do
better than everybody thinks. One of my major objectives during
spring training is to make sure that my players believe and
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least until the Brewers fall 30 games behind, Garner is fired
up, and the game starts wringing its hands anew about existence in
a new century.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball is back, so are the problems.

 &HT;    Hank Aaron's difficult chase
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine what Hank Aaron's career would have been like
if he had been born 25 years later.
</P>
<P>
   He never would have spent the night in rooming houses while his
white teammates slept in a fancy hotels, never would have been
forced to play a road game by baseball's commissioner and never
would have received so much hate mail during ``The Chase.''
</P>
<P>
   He also never would have gotten a moment's peace from the media.
It would have been HankTV 24 hours a day. And, of course, with
present-day salaries, Aaron probably would have made enough money
to retire before reaching 715 home runs, let alone 755.
</P>
<P>
   In this 25th-anniversary season celebration, some aspects of
chasing Babe Ruth's record Aaron doesn't want to remember. Given a
second chance, he would rewrite the script from a quarter-century
ago. Only the ending would stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish all of it could have been done differently,'' said
Aaron, 65, now a Braves executive whose office overlooks Turner
Field. ``I would have made it like it was last year with (Mark)
McGwire and (Sammy) Sosa _ you know, a happy moment, going to the
ballpark, enjoying yourself, doing what you could do best.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched from afar as the St. Louis Cardinals' McGwire and the
Chicago Cubs' Sosa battled to be the first to break Roger Maris'
record of 61 home runs in a single season. He never offered them
advice; they couldn't have related to what he went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for them; I was happy for baseball,'' said Aaron,
who made the big leagues in 1954 when Bobby Thomson broke an ankle
in spring training. ``It was the same way when Pete Rose was
chasing Ty Cobb's (career hits) record. He seemed to be enjoying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Aaron envious? He replied cautiously, ``I think that I was
envious to the point that, yes, I wish it had been me.''
</P>
<P>
   For McGwire and Sosa, the legendary Ruth's record was
once-removed. They thrilled to the chase. Aaron endured it. Not
only was Aaron the first black man to make an assault on a record
held by a white man, but it also was the most prominent record in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And while McGwire and Sosa had two months of excitement, Aaron's
quest stretched out over the 1973 season and into 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most happy time of my life, but yet it should
have been,'' Aaron said. ``You remember all these things, and part
of it kind of chips away at you a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in society would grant Aaron greater acceptance today.
Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947, the year before
Ruth died. ``People were living in the Babe Ruth era; you have to
remember that,'' Aaron said. ``They were not ready to accept (black
players) yet. And here I come along challenging what was one of the
most hallowed, the most prestigious, the biggest record in all of
sport. And people were not about to turn that loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still had those diehard racist people who wanted to hold
onto that.''
</P>
<P>
   And they let him know.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron received more than 900,000 pieces of mail. Some of the
letters and postcards were dripping with hate, racial epithets and
death threats.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, McGwire has received an estimated 100,000 pieces
of mail. A Cardinals official said every piece that she had
inspected was congratulatory, and a good many wanted autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta police assigned Calvin Wardlaw to protect Aaron. He
carried a .38 snub-nosed revolver in a binoculars case, but never
had to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The media was slower to pay attention to the man nicknamed ``Bad
Henry.'' ``It really didn't pick up until about August of '73 (when
he was at 702),'' said Frank Hyland, then The Atlanta Journal beat
writer. ``Then everybody slapped their head and said, 'This guy
might hit 715.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron knew how the media had hounded Maris in 1961, and he
wasn't about to let that happen to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking some of his hair out,'' Aaron said. ``I
wasn't going to buckle under to those guys. I was their last
choice: there was Mickey (Mantle), there was Willie (Mays), there
was Harmon Killebrew. I got to be the last choice. I was close to
breaking the record by the time they knew I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron hit home run No. 713 in the next-to-last game of the 1973
season. In the final game, he had three hits, enough to push his
batting average to .301, but no home runs. For six months, he
waited.
</P>
<P>
   At spring training, the media descended on Aaron. The 1974
season opened in Cincinnati exactly 25 years ago today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very stressful time for him,'' said Ernie Johnson,
Braves announcer and former teammate. ``We all knew he was going to
do it; it was just a question of when he was going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Aaron mentioned that he would sit out the series against
the Reds so he could hit the tying and go-ahead home runs in
Atlanta, commissioner Bowie Kuhn demanded that he play two of the
three games. Braves manager Eddie Mathews was furious but was
forced to comply or face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that the commissioner would take an aggressive
stand like that today,'' Aaron said. ``We didn't have a union back
then. If that happened today to a player, all a player would do is
call up Don Fehr, and Don Fehr would call up Bud Selig, and that
would be the end of that.'' Aaron laughed. ``Don Fehr was still in
diapers then.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gerald Ford threw out the first pitch at
Riverfront Stadium. Aaron tied the record on his first swing of the
season, a 3-1 pitch from Jack Billingham.
</P>
<P>
   He played one more game in Cincinnati _ with no homers _ then it
was back to Atlanta. About 250 members of the media followed him,
less than a third of the mob that covered McGwire and Sosa. Writer
George Plimpton was there, to write a quickie book called ``Hank
Aaron: One for the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great story of the year,'' Plimpton said. ``The
intensity. There was an awful lot of excitement. The whole country
was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning against the Dodgers, Aaron smacked an Al
Downing pitch over the fence in left-center before a record crowd
of 53,775. The wall is still visible in the parking lot where
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium once stood.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-homer celebration, Aaron addressed the crowd. ``I
would just like to say to all the fans here this evening that I
just thank God it's all over with. Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Major League Baseball will honor Aaron
all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little too little as far as I'm concerned,'' Hyland
said. ``Of course, 12 people didn't even have him on their ballot
for the Hall of Fame, which is absolutely unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said, ``I've often thought that Hank really never got
his due, as far as what he accomplished. If he had been playing for
the New York Yankees or in a big market like that, to me, he would
have gotten a lot more recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, who hasn't swung a bat in half a dozen years _ ``I just
don't have any reason'' _ would be reluctant to relive the chase in
today's media climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I could stand it right now,'' he said.
``There was no ESPN, or sports all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hope, then the Braves public-relations director, said Aaron,
``handled it with a tremendous amount of grace.'' However, because
the players had ``fewer times at bat with the media'' then, Hope
said, ``People keep probing and probing for something
controversial. Hank's not a controversial person, but if you're
asked, 'Do you think there's enough blacks in management in
baseball?', you'd have to be a nitwit to say, 'Absolutely.'''
</P>
<P>
   In today's news-hungry climate, ``Henry wouldn't have been able
to move,'' said Dick Cecil, a former Braves official. ``As cool as
he is, he holds most everything in. I think eventually it would
have gotten to him a little bit. McGwire thrived on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the comparisons end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't built like McGwire; my home runs barely made it,''
Aaron said. ``Pitchers, said, 'I almost got him out.'''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't. Until the unlikely day that his record is
broken, the home-run crown belongs to Aaron.

 &HT;    Aaron pleased record ball is resting in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the largest billboards at Turner Field
advertises something that isn't for sale. You've seen the slightly
yellowed baseball towering above the public entrance to the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just any ball.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ball, historic home-run ball No. 715, which left Hank
Aaron's bat and sailed over the left-center field fence on April 8,
1974, to send Aaron past Babe Ruth in the record books. Atlanta
relief pitcher Tom House caught it and returned it to Aaron, who
believes that if it had gone into the stands, someone would have
gotten hurt. He has it on loan to the Braves museum.
</P>
<P>
   But while the slugger always kept this ball safe and close, for
22 years he was annoyed that he could not retrieve his final home
run ball, No. 755. Aaron still doesn't have it, but he is pleased
that a Milwaukee Brewers groundskeeper, who was fired after
catching the ball and leaving the clubhouse with it, no longer has
it, either.
</P>
<P>
   The ball quietly sold for $869,000 in a private deal in
September after failing to reach its reserve price in an auction.
The anonymous buyer, who lives in New Jersey, was a friend of one
of Aaron's friends. ``I know where it is now,'' Aaron said. ``I
know it's in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron had been trying to get the ball away from Richard Arndt
since July 20, 1976, when no one knew that the homer out of County
Stadium would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk about it that much because I get angry about
it,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Arndt claims that the Brewers would not arrange a meeting with
Aaron, but Aaron said that he met him and offered 12 autographed
balls as a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Let me think about it.''' Aaron recalled. ``I said,
'If you walk out of this clubhouse, don't talk to me.' So he walked
out, and the Brewers found out he had taken the ball out of the
clubhouse and fired him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said Arndt called every five years or so. Aaron's sponsor,
Magnavox, offered to buy the ball, ``But just as anybody was
getting ready to make a deal, he'd draw it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Arndt again approached the Brewers. Bud Selig and his
daughter asked Aaron what he thought, and he said, ``Don't even
talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron was further miffed that the ball was autographed: Arndt
attended a card show where Aaron _ who had no idea who he was _
signed the ball. ``That was sneaky,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the ball was offered at an auction in September. Arndt
agreed to give Aaron's ``Chasing the Dream Foundation'' 42 percent
of the proceeds. But while bidding reached $800,000 for No. 755, it
didn't reach Arndt's asking price. So Aaron convinced his lawyer
and the wealthy friend to make a backroom deal. While he still
doesn't have control of the ball, Aaron said, ``I got it out of his
hands; that's the only thing I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., would
love to have that ball, or No. 715, someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the ability to purchase,'' Hall of Fame
spokesman Jeff Idelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron has donated home run balls 500, 600, 700 , 703, 704, 706,
709, 710, 714 and 717, as well as his 3,000th hit. He has also
contributed bats, gloves and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron said No. 715 and the bat he swung belong in Atlanta,
where people can see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the home run here; the ball and bat are supposed to be
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said many years ago he was offered $1 million for the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that I have that I've sold,'' he said. ``And I
never will.''

 &HT;    Lemke waits to play
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Lemke can't remember fielding the seemingly
harmless ground ball last May in Boston, nor the Chicago White Sox
baserunner bearing down on him as he tried to make the tag and
throw to first for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's good,'' Lemke said. ``If I could remember, I
might have had even more trouble sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare has been bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 months after suffering a concussion in a violent
baseline collision with Chad Kreuter, Lemke says he finally feels
like his old self. But as Opening Day arrives, the former Atlanta
Braves second baseman is without a job and knows his baseball
career might have come to a premature end at age 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to retire,'' said Lemke, who spent 10 seasons
with the Braves before signing with Boston last season. ``I'm going
to make sure I'm ready to play when someone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lemke works out five days a week and waits for agent Lonnie
Cooper's telephone to ring with a solid major-league offer. ``I
feel like I'm in pretty good shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lemke's priority until the last few months wasn't getting
ready for baseball again. It was just feeling normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love baseball, but it's not the most important thing for me
right now,'' Lemke said. ``My health is. It's taken a long time to
get that back. Your mind is very complex. Concussions take their
toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days after his May 19th collision with Kreuter in Boston,
Lemke was back in the Red Sox lineup. But his return lasted only
one game.
</P>
<P>
   His head throbbing and unable to sleep, he was re-examined the
next day. The diagnosis was postconcussive syndrome _ a condition
more common in hockey and football.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke went home to Atlanta to recuperate, with no timetable for
his return to the Red Sox. He never made it back to Boston, which
had signed Lemke to a one-year contract late in spring training as
a fill-in at second base for the injured Jeff Frye.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke, who says he had suffered several earlier concussions,
felt disoriented, even in the familiar surroundings of his suburban
Atlanta condo. His short-term memory was affected, and he had
little energy. Lemke's father, Roger, came down from Whitesboro,
N.Y., to be with his son.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite with Braves fans during his 10-year Atlanta career,
Lemke talked with his ex-teammates by telephone but visited Turner
Field only once during his recuperation, when Boston played an
interleague series in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a tough period right now,'' Lemke said then. ``I
really can't sit here and tell you what's wrong and when I'm going
to be back. Hopefully, I can get back to normal, and I'll be a
different me. Well, the old me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took time. A lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke says he really didn't feel as if he had gotten close to
being back to normal until January. That's when he began his
workout program, which includes lifting weights at a gym in the
morning, then hitting in a batting cage and throwing in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe what I went through, but it's not
something I like talking about anyway,'' Lemke said. ``In some
ways, I'm still feeling my way. At first, you're just glad to have
more good days than bad. It's a gradual thing. You have to take it
a little at a time and be thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lemke, who has beaten the odds ever since he was taken in
the 25th round of the 1983 amateur draft, definitely thinks he can
play again.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox and Lemke's old Braves teammates hope he gets
the chance. Lemke has not had an injury-free season in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lemmer has always been one of my favorite players,'' Cox
said. ``I was really worried about him for a while, especially the
more I heard about head injuries like that. I'm just glad he's
finally feeling better. If anyone can make it back, he can.
Baseball needs players like Mark Lemke.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cox says Lemke has a standing offer to rejoin the
Braves organization as a coach once his playing days are over. ``He
belongs in a Braves uniform,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Lemke would like to coach. But not until he's sure he
can't play anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be a good coach if I was still thinking I might be
able to play,'' Lemke said. ``I want to give 100 percent to
anything I do.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lemke will be apart from the game he loves as the season
begins.
</P>
<P>
   He says he doesn't plan to be at Turner Field when the Braves
open against Philadelphia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be too hard,'' Lemke said. ``But I'll definitely be
following the Braves. I still have a lot of friends on the team.
I'm rooting for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are rooting for Lemke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to him a lot,'' said pitcher Tom Glavine, one of
Lemke's closer friends. ``I know he's feeling a ton better. Now
it's just a matter of waiting for an opportunity. I know he can
still play.''

 &HT;    The power of the homer
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Barely two hours after No. 70 had scorched its way
into a party suite just above Busch Stadium's left-field wall, Mark
McGwire put it on the record. The single-season home run record he
had just created in September would be his contribution to the
ages. He had no desire to break it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I did say that,'' McGwire said this spring. ``Now that
I've thought about it, anything's possible. If I had an opportunity
to do it, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   So, 1999 now has a mantra. ``Why not?'' In an era where the home
run has gone from the game's sublime moment to a nightly muscle
dance, McGwire's republishing of the record book says as much about
him as it does the sluggers around him. Baseball has gone over the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   This season will close the most pyrotechnic decade the game has
ever seen. The major-league slugging percentage in the 1990s (.417)
is the highest on record. Nine teams reached the 200-homer level
last year. Only 10 years ago, no club had more than Toronto's 158.
Of the 26 50-homer seasons recorded in major-league history, eight
of them _ 31 percent _ have come in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the hard-hitting 1930s, the majors this
decade are averaging more than nine runs a game (9.3), with at
least one home run being hit every 9 2/3 innings. Last year, that
rate jumped to one every 33 at-bats. With a new imagination
provided by McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr., the
unthinkable of just a few summers ago has now become an idle boast.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of his 50-homer season, Greg Vaughn reported to the
Cincinnati Reds this spring saying, ``I didn't come here to say
I'll hit 50 home runs. I might be short-changing myself. I might
hit 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn? 60? So why not?
</P>
<P>
   There are no fresh explanations. The new parks indeed are
smaller, while the contemporary player is a comparative behemoth.
Hank Aaron in his prime was 6 feet and 180 pounds. Babe Ruth was
6-2 and 215. Check out Larry Walker (6-3, 237) or Jason Giambi
(6-3, 235) or Tony Clark (6-7, 245). McGwire is 6-5, 250.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion-softened pitching has taken a beating. The addition of
four teams in the last six years _ the fastest growth ever allowed
in the game _ means that some 50 pitchers are apprenticing in the
majors instead of learning in the minors. A vast move to lighter
bats has increased bat speeds with surprisingly little drop-off in
distance, improving power numbers for smaller players who could not
wield the 36-40-ounce big sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball still insists that there is nothing different about the
ball, although pitchers and hitters alike swear otherwise. The
freshly printed sixth edition of Total Baseball, MLB's official
encyclopedia, claims that the home run explosion ``has nothing to
do with juicing the ball and everything to do with superb
professional athletes reacting to changing circumstances.''
Two-word rebuttal: Brady Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper truth is that what happened last season might well
have happened in 1994. Before the players' strike on Aug. 11, both
Griffey (40) and Matt Williams (43) were on Roger Maris' tail, and
another four players were within 25 homers with another 45-50 games
to play. The 1998 explosion was only a continuation.
</P>
<P>
   A new panic hit the spring leagues when umpires, under
instructions to call the strike zone as it is defined, stopped
giving strike calls to pitches just off the corners. San Francisco
reliever Julian Tavarez shrieked, ``The strike zone is too narrow.
A guy who hit 30 home runs last year is going to hit 50 this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the game is worried, its reaction does not say so. Almost
embarrassed after the Angels hit just 53 home runs at reconfigured
Edison Park last season, Anaheim officials ordered its center and
left-center walls moved in by nine feet during the winter. Sosa and
McGwire remain front and center in the game's marketing plans. The
first new award established by MLB in nearly a quarter-century will
honor Aaron, the all-time home run king.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if Roger Maris' record had not been torn down so easily
in September, fans would not be clamoring for more. McGwire
finished 1998 with nine more home runs than singles. If laid end to
end, his 70 homers traveled an estimated 29,598 feet, higher than
Mount Everest. In his last three seasons, McGwire has hit 180
homers, exceeding Ruth's three best career years, 173.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Babe Ruth hit them this way,'' New York catcher
Mike Piazza said. ``But I really can't believe that Babe Ruth could
hit them higher or longer than McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why someone could ask the St. Louis first baseman if he
could do it again. Perhaps more amazingly, McGwire gave the
question some thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think you'd have to be at the 40-plateau at the
All-Star break,'' said McGwire, who had just three short of that at
the 1998 break. ``I can only imagine the amount of pressure. I know
what it entailed to reach 60, 61, 62. Try going 10 more. It's hard
to fathom.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any harder than what the nation is imagining now that it's
Opening Day: Why not?

   &UR; EAST DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 106-56, first place
</P>
<P>
   If there is a team that can withstand the loss of a hitter
(Andres Galarraga) who swatted 44 home runs and knocked in 121 runs
last season, it's the Braves. If there is a team that can shrug off
the loss of a reliever (Kerry Ligtenberg) who gained 30 saves last
season, it's the Braves. Until someone proves otherwise, it's the
Braves who are the class of their division. They are also deep.
Galarraga out with cancer? Move Ryan Klesko to first base.
Ligtenberg needs Tommy John surgery? Give the closer's job back to
Mark Wohlers, whose inexplicable wildness prompted the need for a
new closer last year but who for the most part has rediscovered his
control this spring. Another sign of the team's pitching depth:
Bruce Chen, a rookie, was designated as the fifth starter, but he
had a poor spring and Odalis Perez, another rookie, jumped in and
grabbed the job.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Brian Jordan, Bret Boone, Otis Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Having won only one World Series in seven
successive postseason appearances, the Braves have to figure out
how to quiet their critics by winning another.
</P>
<P>
   New York Mets
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 88-74, second place
</P>
<P>
   For a team that thought it was prepared to challenge the Braves'
dominance in the division, the Mets sure have been busy in recent
days and weeks trying to shore up their starting pitching. Orel
Hershiser was a late addition, and general manager Steve Phillips
has not stopped pursuing another starter. The Mets should have won
the wild-card spot last season, but manager Bobby Valentine could
not figure out a way to win one of the last five games. They could
be the wild-card winner this season, but they are counting an awful
lot on a pair of aging outfielders, Rickey Henderson (40) and Bobby
Bonilla (36). Robin Ventura should help at third base, and Mike
Piazza, finally comfortable in New York, should do more than help.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Bonilla, Ventura, Henderson, Hershiser, Armando
Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Todd Hundley, Armando Reynoso, Willie Blair.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The heralded newcomers have to produce to avoid a
repeat of the 1992 debacle that was fueled by the failure of
heralded newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Phillies
</P>
<P>
   Terry Francona, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 75-87, third place
</P>
<P>
   Five losing seasons have followed their stunning 1993 World
Series loss, but the Phillies appear to be doing something right.
They have systematically integrated promising young players into
their lineup, and one of these days the Phillies may actually be a
contender again. Second baseman Marlon Anderson is this season's
rookie addition, joining shortstop Desi Relaford (last year's) and
third baseman Scott Rolen (1997's). First baseman Pat Burrell is on
deck. Catcher Mike Lieberthal and right fielder Bobby Abreu are
other examples of the influx of good-looking young players. The
Phillies only have to hope that Curt Schilling, the pitcher
everyone wants, will not be ancient by the time they are
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Ron Gant, Paul Spoljaric, Chad Ogea, Jeff
Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Ricky Bottalico, Mark Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The Phillies should not expect too much too soon.
Their idea should be just to nurture their young ones carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Expos
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Alou, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 65-97, fourth place
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Alou is the National League version of Tom Kelly, a
manager who could work elsewhere and have a chance to win but who,
out of loyalty, stays where he is. Alou could be managing the
Dodgers, but he chose to stay in Montreal and was rewarded with a
contract worth $2 million a year. His patience and his
resourcefulness will be tested again this season, but he is
comforted by the presence of Vladimir Guerrero, who is on the verge
of becoming one of the game's superstars. As a 22-year-old last
season, Guerrero batted .324, whacked 38 home runs and drove in 109
runs. Alou also likes his young pitchers, even though they threw
the pitches that Mark McGwire hit for Nos. 66 through 70.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Manny Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If Alou can work his managerial magic and foster
inspired play from his youngsters, the Expos at least should be
competitive on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Marlins
</P>
<P>
   John Boles, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 54-108, fifth place
</P>
<P>
   From World Series champion to the team with the worst record in
the majors to what? Marlins fans, if any remain, just can't wait to
find out. The team has a new owner, John Henry, who most likely
would not dismantle the Marlins if they should win the World Series
again. He does not have to worry, though, about facing that dilemma
in the foreseeable future. A bright note for the Marlins is the
return of Alex Fernandez, their No. 1 pitcher, who missed last
season with a torn rotator cuff. A gloomy note is the absence of
Mike Lowell, who was supposed to play third but is out with cancer.
A confusing note is the name of their new rookie shortstop. He is
Alex Gonzalez, and he should be Alex Gonzalez II because the Blue
Jays already have a shortstop named Alex Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Jorge Fabregas.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Edgar Renteria.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Improvement is the best the Marlins can expect,
and Fernandez and a year's experience for the young players should
make that possible.
</P>

<P>
   &UR; CENTRAL DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Astros
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 102-60, first place
</P>
<P>
   When Moises Alou (38 home runs, 124 runs batted in last year)
tore a knee ligament before spring training, the Astros appeared to
suffer a serious setback in their plans to win a third straight
division title under Larry Dierker. But then the teams that seemed
most likely to challenge them for the title, the Cubs and the
Cardinals, suffered their own disastrous injuries. Even if they had
not, though, the Astros might have had enough talent to prevail.
Richard Hidalgo, who batted .303 in 74 games in his rookie season,
replaces Alou in left field, leaving center to Carl Everett, who
batted .296 in 133 games. The Astros no longer have Randy Johnson,
but they did not have him for the first four months last season and
held first place for the last three of those months.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Johnson, Sean Berry, Brad Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The Astros just have to go out and play and leave
the thinking to Dierker, who has earned the right to stop having
people question his credentials as a broadcaster-turned-manager.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 77-85, fourth place
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden, the Reds' creative general manager, has given the
68-year-old McKeon, the majors' oldest manager, an interesting
team. How good it will be remains to be seen. Bowden would like to
steal the wild-card spot, but if the Reds are not in contention for
it by late July, watch Bowden trade away some of his higher-priced
players. Greg Vaughn, who last winter became the first player
traded after hitting 50 home runs, is one centerpiece of the wild
card-or-trade plan. Another is Denny Neagle, the good left-handed
pitcher, who opens the season on the disabled list. The Reds will
also rely on younger players like Sean Casey, Pokey Reese and Aaron
Boone, who make up three-fourths of the infield, and Mike Cameron,
who will steal some bases (27 last year).
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Vaughn, Neagle, Cameron, Steve Avery.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Bret Boone, Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If everything breaks right, and that includes
pitching contributions from Avery and Jason Bere, the Reds could be
a distant second to the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   Tony La Russa, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 83-79, third place
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals could not ride Mark McGwire's mind-boggling 70
home runs to a better record last season, what is he supposed to do
for them this year? The Cardinals begin with two of their starting
pitchers, Matt Morris and Alan Benes, on the disabled list; Ray
Lankford still not ready to play center, and Edgar Renteria having
played no games at shortstop this spring while recovering from a
knee injury. It is a precarious way to start for a team that wants
to contend for first place, but perhaps a newcomer, Eric Davis, and
a rookie, J.D. Drew, will help McGwire make his production
meaningful. In the absence of Morris and Benes, Jose Jimenez, an
impressive rookie, gets a chance to bolster the starting rotation.
The Cardinals may still make a trade for a pitcher, too, perhaps
Kevin Appier.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Renteria, Davis, Ricky Bottalico, Darren Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Brian Jordan, Ron Gant, Delino DeShields, John
Mabry, Jeff Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The Cardinals need peak production from their
healthy players to avoid a bleak season.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs
</P>
<P>
   Jim Riggleman, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 90-73, second place; won the wild card
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs apparently thought so much of the team that won the
one-game playoff for the playoffs last season that they only
tinkered with it. They might have made a fatal mistake. If their
failure to bolster the team was not fatal, the loss of Kerry Wood
should be. The rookie strikeout sensation is out for the season
with a torn elbow ligament, putting a major dent in the Cubs'
chances of returning to the playoffs. They did add a starting
pitcher before Wood went down, but Jon Lieber (19-28 with the
Pirates the past two years) is no Wood. Sammy Sosa is healthy, but
he is also human. The Cubs cannot expect him to give them more than
he did last season; they have to hope he can match it.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Lieber, Benito Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Mark Clark, Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: As goes Sosa, so go the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Pirates
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lamont, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 69-93, sixth place
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the days when they will have a new park, the
Pirates got a little frisky during the winter and signed some
experienced free agents. Pete Schourek will be in their starting
rotation, and Ed Sprague, Pat Meares and Mike Benjamin will make up
three-fourths of their infield, although Benjamin could share
second base with Warren Morris, a good-looking rookie. Two-thirds
of their outfield came in trades, Brian Giles from the Indians for
Ricardo Rincon, and Brant Brown from the Cubs for Jon Lieber. All
of that makes for an unusually high number of players from other
teams for a team that has been rebuilding. Also unusual is their
leadoff hitter, Jason Kendall. Catchers rarely lead off.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Meares, Sprague, Schourek, Giles, Benjamin,
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Tony Womack, Rincon, Lieber.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If the newcomers jell, the Pirates could cause
trouble in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brewers
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 74-88, fifth place
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, their erstwhile owner, is the commissioner; Robin
Yount, their 3,000-hit man, is going into the Hall of Fame, and
County Stadium is making way for a new park next season. None of
those developments will affect the way the Brewers play, but they
may be the most interesting aspects of the team's season. There is
one development to watch on the field. Jim Abbott is continuing his
comeback as a one-handed pitcher, which is heartening enough, but
he also has to bat in the National League and his ability to do
that is simply uncanny. Dave Nilsson is another unusual player. One
of five native Australians who have played in the majors, he also
is the owner of the Australian Baseball League, which he bought in
the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Sean Berry, Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Mike Matheny.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: If the Brewers get creditable pitching from
Abbott, Bill Pulsipher and the rookie Rafael Roque, they could be
interesting some of the time.

</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Dodgers
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 83-79, third place
</P>
<P>
   They signed Kevin Brown for a record $105 million, signed Devon
White and traded for Todd Hundley. But the best move the Los
Angeles Foxes made was hiring Davey Johnson to manage their team.
Felipe Alou was their first choice, and he would have been good,
too, but Johnson's record speaks volumes. In 10 full seasons of
managing, Johnson has led his teams to first- or second-place
finishes each time. This season should make it 11. The Dodgers, of
course, have spared little or no expense to ensure that Johnson's
record is not spoiled. To get Brown, for example, they paid $40
million more than the team with the next-best offer and added a
dozen round-trip charter flights for his family, as if Brown could
not pay for those flights himself.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Brown, White, Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson, Brian Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Not even Hundley's surgically repaired elbow and
Gary Sheffield's unpredictable temperament should keep the Dodgers
from winning.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Giants
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 89-74, second place
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason for the Giants to finish second other than
the fact that Dusty Baker is their manager. Throughout baseball,
Baker is credited with getting more out of his players than most of
his peers. He finds a way to be there, they say. The Giants made
virtually no moves to improve a team that missed the playoffs by
one game, the playoff game it lost to the Cubs. That could work
against them. On the other hand, they are counting on Russ Ortiz
and Chris Brock, pitchers who spent some time with them last
season, to fortify their starting rotation. Ellis Burks, whom the
Giants acquired during the season, has shifted from center field to
right, and Marvin Benard, a .322 hitter last season, has moved to
center.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITION: Scott Servais.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Jose Mesa, Orel Hershiser, Joe Carter.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Baker has to do whatever it is that makes him so
good, and the players have to keep responding.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Rockies
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 77-85, fourth place
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies have not played a regular-season game for him, but
Jim Leyland has already learned what Don Baylor, his predecessor,
lived with every year of the team's existence. Winning will not be
easy until the Rockies raise the level of talent on the pitching
staff. Jerry McMorris, the owner, gave Leyland $2 million a year to
get the Rockies back to the playoffs, where Baylor led them in
their third year. But the only starter they added was Brian
Bohanon, and he's no No. 1. Darryl Kile was No. 1 for Houston with
a 19-7 record two years ago, but with Colorado last season he had a
13-17 record and 5.20 earned run average. Pedro Astacio had an even
higher ERA, 6.23, the league's highest for pitchers who threw more
than 75 innings.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: None.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Runs will continue to pour across the plate for
the Rockies. Leyland's job is to stop the the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 65-97, fifth place
</P>
<P>
   The fastest way to respectability, if not the playoffs, is with
pitching, the Diamondbacks' brain trust concluded. The fastest way
to good pitching, they decided, was the free-agent market. Enter
Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso. But pitchers
cannot win games by themselves, unless they pitch shutouts, and in
their initial season the Diamondbacks had one of the weakest
offenses in the league. So they set out to improve there, too. They
added outfielders Luis Gonzalez, Steve Finley and Bernard Gilkey
and also acquired Tony Womack, a base-stealing second baseman, to
play in the outfield, only to have him get hit by a pitch that
broke his wrist. Matt Williams could help by wiping out one of his
worst offensive seasons (.267, 20 home runs, 71 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Johnson, Stottlemyre, Finley, Reynoso, Gonzalez,
Womack.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: The Diamondbacks have invested so much in their
pitching, it had better take them somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy, manager
</P>
<P>
   1998: 98-64, first place
</P>
<P>
   The symmetry is too good to pass up: the Padres can become the
first team to go from first to last to first to last. No, that's
not their idea of a good pattern to follow, but they are in danger
of tumbling from first to last for the second time in three years.
The Padres argue that they have not followed the example of the
Florida Marlins after their victory in the 1997 World Series, and
they really haven't. But their offers to their free agents fell
short of what others offered, and suddenly the cupboard was barer.
Their trade of Greg Vaughn, their 50-home run man, emptied it even
more and undermined their argument. Then Carlos Hernandez ruptured
his Achilles' tendon and became lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   KEY ADDITIONS: Woody Williams, Reggie Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   KEY LOSSES: Kevin Brown, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley, Joey
Hamilton, Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   KEY TO SEASON: Reggie Sanders cannot replace Vaughn's 50 home
runs, and the rookie pitchers Stan Spencer and Matt Clement cannot
replace Kevin Brown.

<P>
   More than 50 years after the ball was hit, Joe Cleary can still
see the bad hop. Coming in for the Washington Senators in his first
major league game, with two runners on base and one out, Cleary got
the first Boston batter to hit what looked like a perfect
double-play ball. Instead, it skipped into the outfield. Then the
roof fell in.
</P>
<P>
   Eight more batters came to the plate that day in August 1945,
and Cleary got only one of them out: the pitcher. The Red Sox
scored 12 runs, leaving him with an earned run average of 189.00 _
still the highest calculable ERA in the history of baseball. When
he returned to the dugout, he and his manager nearly came to blows.
And ``the short, unhappy life of Joe Cleary in the big leagues,''
as Cleary himself now calls it, was over.
</P>
<P>
   The major league season starts Sunday and, as is always the
case, dozens of rookies will see stardom looming before them. But
for all their promise, at least a few of them will become answers
to a trivia question, appearing but once. Then something _ injuries
or fate or their own abilities _ will keep them from ever coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Countless ballplayers have come up to the major leagues for the
proverbial cup of coffee, but only a few hundred have tasted the
demitasse of a single game _ often at the end of blowouts or in the
waning days of a losing season. Most were standouts at every
previous level of play. In the more democratic ranks of the minor
leagues or spring training camps, all rubbed shoulders with
baseball's immortals: names like Satchel Paige, Duke Snider, Bobby
Thomson and Ted Williams fill their reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   Some bask in those memories. For others, their short careers
still gnaw at or embarrass them. Most have replayed their cameo
appearances a thousand times, and can recall the minutest details.
And they still hear from fans. When Earl Huckleberry died a few
weeks ago at the age of 88, 65 years after starting a game for
Connie Mack, he left behind a pile of autograph requests at the
Bowlegs, Okla., post office.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Shepard, a returning veteran who had lost the bottom of his
leg when shot down over Germany, came in to relieve Joe Cleary that
day in 1945. Though he pitched well _ giving up one run on three
hits over the rest of the game _ he, too, never played in the major
leagues again. Shepard suspects it was partly a matter of sympathy.
``Nobody wanted to see me go in and get clobbered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Van Dusen, an 18-year-old fresh from Bryant High School in
New York City, got his turn 10 years later, with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth against the Milwaukee Braves. His team, the
Philadelphia Phillies, was getting trounced and had run out of
pinch-hitters, even sending up a pitcher, Robin Roberts, before Van
Dusen. He finally got his chance _ and was hit by a pitch. He never
batted again. ``Well, they didn't get me out,'' said Van Dusen, an
insurance broker in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In the ranks of these one-game wonders can be found baseball's
rarest commodity: perfection. There are numerous hitters who batted
1.000 and pitchers who never allowed a base runner. More common are
pitchers with astronomical _ or even incalculable _ ERA's and
batters with a long string of goose eggs. And numerous oddities
fall somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Like Archibald (Moonlight) Graham, the New York Giants
outfielder immortalized in ``Field of Dreams,'' Frank Verdi of the
Yankees played an inning in the field but never got to bat; Casey
Stengel sent him up to pinch hit, only to change his mind when the
Red Sox changed pitchers. John Corriden of the 1946 Brooklyn
Dodgers pinch ran and scored, but also never got to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Harley Hisner of the Red Sox struck out Mickey
Mantle twice and gave up Joe DiMaggio's last regular-season hit. He
also batted 1 for 2, ending up with a career average higher than
either of them. ``That ought to be worth $2 million now,'' said
Hisner, a retired machinist in Monroeville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1981 season, John Lickert came in to catch for
the Red Sox in the seventh inning. But the closest he got to the
batter's box (apart from crouching behind home plate) was the
on-deck circle. So upset was Lickert's father that he confronted
the Red Sox manager, Ralph Houk, in the locker room. ``I'm probably
the only guy who has 17 zeroes in the record book,'' said Lickert,
who lives in Rhode Island and delivers cars for Subaru.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the fraternity of these footnoters, there are
legends. Playing for a team cobbled together when the real Detroit
Tigers went on strike in 1912, a seminarian named Aloysius Travers
pitched a complete game, and gave up 26 hits.
</P>
<P>
   After yielding four hits to the first five batters in his debut
in 1918, a Brooklyn rookie named Harry Heitman stalked off the
mound, enlisted in the Navy and never played again. Another famous
Dodger, Walter Alston, struck out in his only at-bat for the St.
Louis Cardinals (and made an error in the field). Then there was
Eddie Gaedel, the midget who walked in his only plate appearance,
for the St. Louis Browns, in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four players Mike Palagyi of the Washington Senators
faced in one game in 1939, three were future members of the Hall of
Fame: Ted Williams and Joe Cronin, both of whom he walked, and
Jimmy Foxx, whom he hit with a pitch. ``I threw but 2 strikes out
of 15 pitches _ a very short big league career,'' Palagyi told
Richard Tellis, author of ``Once Around the Bases'' (Triumph Books,
1998), which chronicles the stories of 40 players who lasted a
single game.
</P>
<P>
   There is John Paciorek, the only player ever to get three hits
in three at-bats. And while Robin is the Yount being inducted into
the Hall of Fame this year, his older brother, Larry, has his own
superlative: perhaps the shortest major league career ever. Yount
made the box score but never threw a pitch, opting while warming up
on the mound to save his sore arm for another day, a day that never
came. ``I never thought in my wildest dreams that it would be the
end of my career,'' Yount now says.
</P>
<P>
   In a game based more on money, in which every prospect is an
investment, expansion has made manpower more precious and
serendipity and whimsy have largely vanished, the frequency of
one-game wonders has dwindled. So too, then, has the likelihood
that certain elusive milestones will ever be achieved. While two
players (pitchers, at that) have tripled in their only plate
appearances, no one has ever homered. And perhaps no one ever will.

   Bobby Davidson pitched an inning for the Yankees in 1989, enough
time to give up a two-run homer to George Brett. ``Sometimes I
think about it, it almost feels like a dream,'' he said of his
brief big league career. Davidson, who became a chimney sweeper and
now works in computers in Cincinnati, has never been back to the
Bronx; he said he can't afford the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the lost child, the prodigal son, except I don't
feel there's a way to return,'' Davidson said. ``Every spring
there's a feeling that you're not where you're supposed to be. I
don't know if that will ever leave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Roe Skidmore had been riding the bench for the Chicago
Cubs for weeks when, in September 1970, Leo Durocher sent him up to
pinch hit. He hit the second pitch from Jerry Reuss over the head
of Joe Torre, then the Cardinals' third baseman, for a single.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was then retrieved _ the ball which still sits on his
mantelpiece, the one on which his wife wrote ``1st Big League
hit,'' not knowing she could have written ``last'' or ``only'' too.
Why? He thinks Durocher had it right about nice guys finishing
last. ``I didn't whine,'' said Skidmore, now a businessman in
Decatur, Ill. Every spring training, he said, a certain hollow
feeling grabs his gut. ``I'll go two or three weeks where I don't
even want to pick up the paper,'' he said. ``I just kind of ignore
the fact that it's starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore is one of at least 60 players to go 1 for 1. Only two
went 2 for 2, and only 18-year-old John Paciorek, brother of two
other major leaguers, went 3 for 3, singling three times and
walking twice for the ninth-place Houston Colt .45's against the
last-place Mets in the final game of the 1963 season. ``Every time
I came up the ball looked like a watermelon,'' said Paciorek, now a
physical education teacher and coach at a private school in
California. But a bad back did him in.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme was Joe Campbell of the 1967 Cubs, one of
only a few players to strike out all three times he batted. (True,
George Goetz fanned all four times he got up in 1889, but he was a
pitcher.) ``I was just too anxious, not that anyone's stuff was all
that great,'' said Campbell, who runs a Chevrolet dealership in
Lexington, Ky. ``I hit four or five balls out of the park foul. I
was getting good wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Bruckbauer, the first native Minnesotan to play for the
Minnesota Twins, seemed to spend more of his career at the Mayo
Clinic, nursing a bad arm, than on any team. He faced four batters
in 1961; three got hits on bloopers and scratch singles, he insists
_ and one walked. ``We'll get 'em next time,'' the Twins' manager,
Cookie Lavagetto, told him before giving him the hook. But there
was no next time, leaving Bruckbauer with an ignominious career ERA
of infinity.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dusen, who had hit a grand slam in a high school
championship game at Ebbets Field only a few weeks before his major
league debut, can still recall what Humberto Robinson threw him.
There was a strike down the middle (``That was the one I should
have swung at''), then a check swing, then a ball. Then came the
breaking pitch that nicked him on the knee. He didn't feel it. It
was his first game, he said, and he was already numb.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter Van Dusen was in the minors, where he partied
hard __ ``a million-dollar body with a nickel head'' is how he
described himself _ and quickly went ``from being a prospect to a
suspect.'' Soon he was through, and 20 years went by before he
could live with baseball again. ``Sometimes I go to sleep thinking
about hitting a hanging curve, even to this day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 80-year-old Cleary, the last major leaguer born in
Ireland, who watched Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium and regularly
sneaked into the Polo Grounds (``it was a sieve''), he has not been
to a game since 1954, though he lives in the Bronx. Then again, his
memories are more painful.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary had played years of semipro ball _ ``You've got a great
arm there, Kid, but you throw too many curveballs,'' Grover
Cleveland Alexander once told him _ and fought overseas before his
inning of infamy. Nothing fazed him. ``I always said, I get that
ball in my hand, I'm the boss, what can they do to hurt me?'' he
recalled. ``I never had butterflies. I could hardly wait to get on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   But then came the bad hop, some wildness, some bad breaks; the
payoff pitch to Dolph Camilli, Cleary insists, could just as easily
have been called a strike. Not deigning to come to the mound, the
Washington manager, Ossie Bluege, disgustedly waved for Cleary to
come in to the dugout. ``It was like he'd just found me in bed with
his wife,'' Cleary recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cleary waited for the manager to do the right thing: to
come and get him. ``Son, I think you better leave now,'' the umpire
eventually told him. But only when Bert Shepard reached the mound _
``Anyone can have a bad day, but imagine being replaced by a guy
with one leg!'' Cleary lamented _ did he walk toward the dugout.
``I took 30-mile hikes in the Army that weren't as long,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bluege greeted him with an obscenity which suggested that he was
never much of a pitcher to begin with. Cleary replied in kind, and
only his teammates prevented a fist fight. The next day he was
shipped to the minors, and he never came back.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican immigrants have brought a passion for baseball back to
Cleary's neighborhood. On the street, at the bar, in the liquor
store where he now picks up his mail _ it gets stolen when left in
his apartment building _ he is a minor celebrity, who still gets
ribbed about his baseball career and his bloated earned run
average. But he can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only answer I give them is, `Hey, I was there,' '' he
said. ``Only 14,000 guys have made it.''

MAYOR SAYS HE SEES BOTH SIDES OF PLAN NOT TO TRY PROTESTERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that he could
``see both sides'' of the plan by prosecutors to drop charges
against the 1,200 people arrested for civil disobedience last month
over the police killing of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, noting that many of the protesters had spent several
hours in jail, said he could understand both the desire, expressed
by Police Commissioner Howard Safir, to have the arrests prosecuted
and the need to have the charges dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Police Department would have preferred that the
cases had gone forward as a vindication of the law,'' he said at a
news conference at the New York International Auto Show Saturday.
But he added: ``The district attorney made a practical judgment _
1,500 or 1,700 cases _ that the point had been made through the
retention process. He felt that was sufficient punishment. I can
see both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, had said on
Friday he would most likely ask a criminal court judge to dismiss
those charges.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made a point of highlighting how Morgenthau had
praised the police officers involved in the arrests _ often
hundreds per day _ for showing respect toward the demonstrators,
many of whom were prominent politicians or celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at how all the arrests were carried out,'' the mayor
said. ``In other times and in other places you would have seen
something very different happening. But instead what you see is an
example of, even when provoked, a very restrained, very respectful
Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, held in front of Police Headquarters, ended
last week with the arraignment of four New York City police
officers on second-degree murder charges in Diallo's shooting
death.
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of people arrested, including Sharpton, is to
appear in court on April 7.

 &HT;    U.S. TO MISS ALL 8 EDUCATIONAL TARGETS IN `GOALS 2000'
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. With GOALS-DATA. For release Sunday, April 4.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation is going to miss every one of the eight
educational goals set for next year in the ``Goals 2000'' program,
according to the state-federal panel set up to monitor its
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Some states will reach some goals, but none will achieve all
eight, according to the bipartisan National Education Goals Panel.
</P>
<P>
   The goals grew out of high-profile education summits with all 50
governors convened by President Bush in 1989 and President Clinton
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambitious aims? Of course,'' Bush said in 1990 as he announced
the first draft of the goals as Clinton and other reform-minded
governors looked on. ``Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at
stake. This nation will not accept anything less than excellence in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress made the final set of eight goals official in 1994 by
including them in the ``Goals 2000: Educate America Act.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the panel has measured significant national progress
toward only two of the goals: education and health programs for
pre-schoolers, and test scores in mathematics and science.
</P>
<P>
   It said conditions were unchanged or the record was mixed in
four areas: graduation rates, student citizenship and competency in
eight core subjects, parental participation, and schools free of
violence, drugs, firearms and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said performance has actually declined during the
1990s in the two other areas: teacher education and professional
development, and lifelong learning and adult literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in North Carolina, followed by South Carolina,
California, Colorado and Texas, have shown the most signs of
improvement in the 1990s, according to the panel. Another 13 showed
``significant'' improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Georgia and Ohio were among the 32 that missed that
honor roll.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Nelson, executive director of the panel, said the panel's
members all concluded in February that they should acknowledge that
the goals wouldn't be met.
</P>
<P>
   They adopted this recommendation: ``The national education goals
should be renamed 'America's education goals' and be continued
beyond the year 2000 without a specific deadline for their
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the deadline would be a sound idea, agreed Chairman
John Porter, R-Ill., of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
education. Otherwise, he said, ``We could end up like the former
Soviet Union, with five-year plans, 10-year plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals panel includes eight governors, four state
legislators, four members of Congress and two Clinton
administration officials. Some were disappointed by the failure to
meet the goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been there, frustrated, because over the period of
time we have been on (the panel) we have not had any measurable
change in the statistics in this country about the state of our
education,'' said Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who chairs the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
</P>
<P>
   But others took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``By setting these ambitious education goals, we challenge our
children and ourselves to be the best we can be,'' said Gov. Jim
Hunt of North Carolina. His state and Texas were cited by the panel
as the nation's most successful pioneers in tying education reforms
to measurable results, rather than to how much money or effort was
devoted to change.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Hunt said, ``Parents and educators agree
that these goals are extremely important and we have made great
progress in preparing our children for school, creating safer
schools, and preparing students to succeed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   However, national polls show that employers and college
professors aren't as happy as parents and educators about the early
impact of recent reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who employ people out of high school or teach first-year
or second-year classes continue to believe these young people don't
have the skills for the workplace or college when they graduate,''
said Deborah Wadsworth of Public Agenda, a nonprofit, nonpartisan
research organization in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Public Agenda's review of opinion polls found ``widespread
public support for all eight national goals, on somewhat different
levels of urgency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The goals with the most intense support from the most people are
ensuring school safety, raising academic achievement, lowering
dropout rates and increasing parental participation.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the Goals 2000 program has been ``a relatively
successful experiment in education in a typically American way,''
according to a study conducted for the panel by Richard F. Elmore
of Harvard University's Graduate School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every state that has ventured into reform can show
some evidence of improved student performance in at least some
subjects at some grade levels in the early stages of reform,''
Elmore said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``While the transformations have been substantial
at the level of political rhetoric and policy, they have yet to
work their way fully into the daily life of schools and local
school systems in the same dramatic way.''

SMALL GROUP OF SCOTTISH-AMERICANS MARCHES IN FIRST TARTAN DAY
PARADE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city where the ambition of just about every
ethnic, immigrant and religious group is to block traffic for a few
hours and hold its own noisy street parade, it must be said that
the Scots have been self-effacing to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   Even Saturday, at what was billed as the first annual Tartan Day
Parade, Scottish-Americans displayed a modesty rarely witnessed in
the boisterous, quarrelsome world of New York City national-day
parade organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole Scottish march, which started at the British Consulate
on 51st Street and Third Avenue and ended 10 blocks away, across
from the United Nations on First Avenue, lasted 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 100 people showed up, one-third of them musicians
from the Emerald Society, a fraternal organization for police
officers of Irish roots, and an additional 10 or so who work for
the Chicago-based beer distributor that sponsored the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish-Americans did not disrupt the city by marching on
the street. Laden with bagpipes, they kept politely to the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not by nature overly assertive,'' said Cliff Robertson,
the actor and grand marshal of the parade. ``We're not ashamed of
our history, but we're not assertive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson wore his own dark-blue-and-green kilt, tartan plaid
knee socks and a black tam-o'-shanter trimmed in red. He also
carried a tall gold staff.
</P>
<P>
   Alan L. Bain, the president of the American-Scottish Foundation
and the owner of a Manhattan real estate services company, said
Scots have taken so long to start their own parade because they
have been reluctant to assert their own ``personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call the Scottish clannish for nothing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the many famous New Yorkers of Scottish descent _
Archibald Gracie, whose mansion houses the city's mayors; the
industrialist Andrew Carnegie; the architect Stanford White and the
former Mayor, John V. Lindsay _ Scots have developed an image
problem in the very city they helped settle in the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people don't understand the difference
between the British, the Scottish, the Welsh and the Irish,'' Bain
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes that holding a Tartan Day Parade each year
might help make the distinctions clearer, although he was quick to
add that Scottish-Americans do not aspire to challenge the Irish
and their St. Patrick's Day Parade for dominance. ``The Irish,'' he
said, ``do it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The date for the parade was chosen to coincide _ almost, but not
quite _ with the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath on
April 6, 1320. The declaration, said Bain in a rare flash of
boldness, was a plea by the Scottish nobility to the pope to
preserve their independence ``from British marauders.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO said Saturday that it was planning to
send a force of 6,000 to 8,000 troops to Albania to provide
security and emergency relief for the masses of Kosovo Albanians
who have been driven from neighboring Yugoslavia by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is mobilizing all its available resources for this urgent
humanitarian requirement,'' the alliance's spokesman, Jamie P.
Shea, said. He announced that allied ambassadors had asked the top
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, for a plan to
deploy an operational headquarters, helicopters, troops and
supplies to Albania as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also said that Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain,
commanding a force of more than 10,000 British, French and German
troops in Macedonia that was originally intended for a peacekeeping
mission in Kosovo, was ordered to put all of them to work helping
Macedonia deal with the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Macedonia, saying it was overwhelmed by the flow of
people into the country, announced that it would close its border.
Defense Ministry officials in London said 200,000 Kosovo Albanians
are currently making their way toward Macedonia on the road from
Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 165,000 refugees have already arrived in Albania from
Kosovo since the allies began bombing to try to stop the Serbian
campaign, according to allied officials. Shea said that 55,000
people crossed into Albania Friday alone, and that 290,000 Kosovo
Albanians had fled into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro in the
last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate,'' Shea said Saturday, ``if you do a mathematical
calculation, Serb forces will have emptied Kosovo of its entire
population in 10 to 20 days.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that despite the missile attacks that blew
up the Yugoslav and Serbian Interior Ministries headquarters in
Belgrade shortly after midnight, bad weather overnight kept large
numbers of allied planes from going after the Serb forces driving
people from Kosovo. Those operations would continue once the
weather cleared, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea and others here deny that the air campaign targeted the
Yugoslav president, Slodoban Milosevic, who has shown no signs of
relenting in his campaign against the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians
who once lived in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the business that we're into,'' said the British
air commodore, David Wilby, the allied military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Saturday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain issued
some of the strongest statements yet by an allied leader against
the Yugoslav leader, ``Your policy of ethnic cleansing is an act of
barbarity,'' he said in a message broadcast on Sky Television. ``We
will defeat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark charged Saturday that the flood of refugees was part of a
deliberate strategy by Milosevic to destabilize the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a calculated, deliberate, arranged, pre-planned
humanitarian catastrophe,'' he told a small group reporters at the
alliance's military headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It serves two purposes,'' Clark added. ``Not only does it
change the demographics in Kosovo, but it helps to destabilize
Macedonia. So it is part of his ongoing strategy to cause
difficulty for that democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
   To help the refugees, NATO erected 3,500 tents Saturday and
plans to ship another 5,000 tents over the next 24 hours, Western
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials here said they believed that the Serbian
campaign was aimed at emptying a large triangle of territory in
Kosovo, roughly a triangle between Pristina and the cities of Pec
and Prizren, of its ethnic Albanian inhabitants and replacing them
with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some reports of Serbian refugees from the Krajina
entering Kosovo,'' said Edgar Buckley, a British official,
referring to a region of Croatia that was largely emptied of Serbs
in fighting in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With clouds and rain keeping most of the 450-odd allied planes
from hitting the Serbian military and police forces enough to keep
them from driving more refugees out, the allies are now being
forced to deal with the humanitarian disaster spreading into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who met with the
Albanian president and prime minister Saturday in Tirana, canceled
a stopover in Rome to fly to Skopje, Macedonia. The Macedonians
said they decided to close the border out of concern that the
massive influx of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could upset the
ethnic balance of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their concerns are absolutely legitimate and understandable,''
Talbott said, after meeting with Kosovo refugees in a tent city of
2,000 in Tirana. ``We are seeing with our own eyes today a policy
on the part of Yugoslavia to undercut the viability of neighboring
states.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott's delegation also sped to Macedonia with the aim of
pressuring its leaders to open up the borders again and let the
refugees in, another American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has absorbed 55,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The allies say they have observed about 25,000 people backed up
inside Kosovo behind the border crossing point waiting for the Serb
authorities to let them pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let you down,'' Blair told the refugees in his
British television interview Saturday. ``We will make sure that you
are able to return to your homes, and live in your homes in
peace,'' he said. ``That is our promise to you and we will carry it
out.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Shea said that Jackson had already asked for 1 million food
rations, 50,000 gallons of drinking water, and 187,000 blankets and
was setting up a feeding station near the border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Three American soldiers on a border patrol fell into Serbian
hands earlier in the week and were taken prisoner. A Western
official said Saturday that there was evidence the three American
soldiers now being detained in Yugoslavia were kidnapped by
Yugoslav special forces who crossed into Macedonia and took the
Americans out.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have also expressed concern about the situation in
Montenegro, which is federated with Serbia within Yugoslavia.
Milosevic replaced eight Yugoslav military commanders in Montenegro
this week, allied officials said, and could be preparing a coup
there.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to destabilize the government of Montenegro ``could
have more serious consequences,'' Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
of France said in Paris Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which fears an uncontrolled influx of refugees across the
Adriatic, asked its allies on Friday to create a force to ensure
the safety of the refugees in Albania. Italy has offered to lead
the force and provide most of the soldiers for it, according to an
Italian official here.
</P>
<P>
   American, British and French warplanes continued to launch
attacks from bases in Italy Saturday, officials said, in an effort
to stop the Serb persecution and stem the refugee flow.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the allies met here to discuss other emergency steps to
deal with the victims of the violence in Kosovo, British and NATO
officers said that the American and British cruise missiles
launched from ships at targets in central Belgrade in the predawn
hours Saturday morning had caused no significant damage to civilian
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile attacks destroyed the Serbian and Yugoslav
Interior Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Air Marshal John Day, chief of the British defense staff in
London, described these headquarters as ``the nerve center of
operations planned to drive out ethnic Albanians in a campaign of
violence, intimidation and thuggery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's attacks will continue and can be intensified even
further if necessary,'' he said. ``The weather is forecast to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only need a couple of days of good weather to be able to
have a maximized effect,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said allied planes had managed Friday to hit staging areas
used by the Yugoslav 547th Mechanized Brigade for attacks against
civilians, but he did not say how much damage the planes did.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were in three areas along the road between Prizren
and Djakovica in southwestern Kosovo.

 &HT;    Daly only thinking one game at a time
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chuck Daly says he hasn't had time to think about
whether he will return as head coach in Orlando, Fla., next season.
Daly, 68, is in the second year of a three-year, $15 million deal
that includes an option for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Daly said, ``I was talking to (team trainer) Tim
Walsh when we were sitting on the bus the other day and he said:
`Who did we play yesterday?' And he's a young guy who doesn't have
`senior' moments. I might occasionally have some senior moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can hardly remember who you played the last two games
because of the way the schedule is set up. So, quite frankly, your
job as a coach in this league is the next game. You're so worried
about the next opponent. So I really haven't had enough time to
think about anything. And I'm not going to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtics' jump-off point
</P>
<P>
   According to franchise patriarch Red Auerbach, the Celtics are
two players away from contending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a power forward _ in other words, a go-to rebounder, a
guy who, when that ball goes up, you've got this animal who's going
to get it,'' Auerbach said. ``And we need another big guard,
someone 6-3 or 6-4 that can play defense and shoot a little bit. If
we get those two, we'll be very highly competitive, because our
center position (Vitaly Potapenko) is good now, and I also like
(Tony) Battie. Battie plays hard and blocks shots; he's a perfect
backup. But if you get one more big guy, you'll really be in good
shape here.'' Coach Rick Pitino says things will be better next
season. Otherwise, he said, ``I'll kill myself. So you don't have
to worry about killing me, because I'll kill me. The best bridge to
hang from, because of my dear effects, is the (Boston University)
bridge. That's what I love the most is the BU bridge because of my
starting out there at a very young age.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel the Heat
</P>
<P>
   Upset by his team's play, Pat Riley put his players through
three rigorous, training camp-style practices before the Heat
returned to action Thursday, seeking to turn around a 4-5 slump.
Riley took some of the blame because he said he tried to implement
too many defensive schemes in recent games, which seemed to confuse
his players. Riley said his players will go back to playing defense
``his way.'' ... Jamal Mashburn is back after missing 26 games, and
he has a new role. There won't be as many isolations run for him.
Eventually, Mashburn will supplant Dan Majerle at small forward,
with Majerle shifting to the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Magic guard Nick Anderson will be out indefinitely with two
strained hamstrings. ``Yeah, both of my legs are hurting,''
Anderson told a reporter. ``You want to loan me one?'' . . .
Dominique Wilkins came off the bench to score 17 points in the
Magic's 100-98 win over New Jersey Tuesday. Wilkins played only 13
minutes, but got off 13 shots, hitting six, with six rebounds. ``I
do the things I've always done,'' said Wilkins, 39. ``I think
(Magic coaches) are starting to have more faith in me. They know
I'm going to come in and play hard.'' . . . He's hurting, but Allen
Iverson is playing through a right quadriceps injury. ``I'm not
sitting,'' Iverson said. ``I refuse to sit and watch this team
lose. I can't do it. I just can't.'' . . . In a 101-91 loss to the
Toronto Raptors, Cleveland fans screamed at coach Mike Fratello,
who said, ``I'm sorry.'' . . . When the Pistons went from the weary
walk-it-up Hawks to the run-crazed Celtics, coach Alvin Gentry
described it as ``facing Charlie Hough and his 40-mph knuckleball
one day and then Nolan Ryan the next.

 &HT;    Oakley drives Raptors
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't expect Charles Oakley to be what he's
become. You don't expect him to take a young player like Vince
Carter by the elbow and guide him through the minefields of the
NBA. You don't expect him to be the vocal leader of a team closing
in on last year's total of 18 wins and vying for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what has happened, making the Toronto Raptors'
acquisition of Oakley for Marcus Camby the best deal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   There were bigger names in bigger transactions _ Scottie Pippen
to Houston, Tom Gugliotta to Phoenix, Glen Rice to the Lakers,
Latrell Sprewell to New York, Stephon Marbury to New Jersey. But
none has had the impact of Oakley's bruising presence and _ get
this _ calming influence.
</P>
<P>
   Going to Toronto required Oakley to become a true leader, and
not just by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the respect of the younger players,'' said coach Butch
Carter, who has done a commendable job of using his talent. ``Oak
has been through the wars, and he's sharing his knowledge. He's
been great. They all listen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Carter has had his ear bent by Oakley. ``I give a
lot of credit to him,'' said Carter, the front-runner for rookie of
the year. ``He's taken me under his wing and helped me on the
attitude I need to have to play in this league, the way to prepare
for games and anything else you can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held Oakley in the highest regard. When the Raptors
visited New York's Madison Square Garden in February, the Knicks
showed a one-minute video montage of Oakley highlights as a tribute
to the player whose physical nature epitomized their successful
teams of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But it was shown at halftime of the game, when the Raptors were
in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to do something, they should have done it
before the game,'' Oakley said. ``I appreciate it, but do it
professionally. They always talk about being professional. I didn't
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Oakley _ brutally blunt. When told by Knicks general
manager Ernie Grunfeld over the telephone that he was being traded,
Oakley interrupted and said, ``If I'm traded, I'm traded. I'm no
longer your commodity.'' Then he hung up on Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   When Oakley saw Grunfeld at John Starks' golf outing in
September, the general manager extended his hand. Oakley refused to
take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to tell the truth,'' he said, ``and (Grunfeld and
Knicks president Dave Checketts) are big on making things out like
they do everything for the community. We know it's all about making
money. They got rid of Anthony Mason because he was supposed to
create some problems, but then they come back and have Dennis Scott
and Latrell Sprewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Oakley, it's been the Knicks' loss. ``Losing Oak without
a doubt hurts you,'' said the Lakers' Derek Harper, a former Knick.
Teams ``always try to get younger. But getting younger doesn't
necessarily mean you're getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are better with Oakley. Carter is a star in the
making. Veterans Doug Christie, Dee Brown and Kevin Willis have
been steady. Youngsters Tracy McGrady and John Wallace are
talented. And then there's the unlikely leader, Oakley, on the
unlikely playoff contender. Who would have thought this possible?

 &HT;    Sprewell wants to start
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ In two games last week, the
<TEXT>
New York Knicks had three on-court incidents that led to technical
fouls or ejections. None involved the notorious Latrell Sprewell.
<P>
   Which speaks to the behavior the former Golden State player has
displayed in his first season back since being suspended last
season for choking Warriors coach P.J. Carlisemo. The most Sprewell
has done in the way of a distraction is continually acknowledge
that he does not like his role off the Knicks' bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd like to be starting,'' he said. ``I'm not going
to say I'm happy coming off the bench.'' Asked if he would have
chosen the Knicks to sign with as a free agent if he knew he would
not be a regular, he said, ``I don't know. It's one of those things
where I'd see what's available.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy was less than pleased with Sprewell's
near-obsession with starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my druthers,'' Van Gundy said, ``would I have him
say, `The Knicks brought me here, showed a lot of faith in me _
I'll do whatever they wanted me to do to help us win?' Yeah. That's
what I'd rather have him not just say but believe. But this is the
NBA. I'm not sure that's going to happen or if it's realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In attitude, Sprewell has been exemplary. Last week, he stayed
out of trouble while watching against the Lakers as forward Kurt
Thomas was ejected for taking down Dennis Rodman and Chris Dudley
got a technical for hitting Shaquille O'Neal with the ball.
Tuesday, he saw teammate Patrick Ewing and Indiana's Jalen Rose
square off in New York.
</P>
<P>
   THE CANDY MAN
</P>
<P>
   Want the inside scoop on the emergence of Orlando's Darrell
Armstrong, the reigning NBA player of the week? He has a pregame
cup of coffee with seven packets of sugar and chocolate candy bars
before games and at halftime to build his perpetual energy.
</P>
<P>
   Since Armstrong's sweet tooth was reported in Orlando, he has
been bombarded with Easter candy. ``From where he has come three or
four years ago, it's amazing,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ''He
gives Orlando such energy and heart. He's irrepressible, absolutely
irrepressible. It's like he's on a chocolate, sugar high all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   NO LOVE FOR NCAA
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Sam Mitchell spent Monday night doing something _
anything _ other than watching the NCAA championship game. In fact,
he missed the whole tournament because he said he can't stand the
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give coaches millions of dollars (in salary),'' he said.
``You give schools millions of dollars (in revenue). And then a kid
who's got nothing gets $20 to buy a pizza or call home, and it's a
violation. When I hear the `purity and sanctity of college
basketball,' that's bull.

 &HT;    Mavs guard Nash pariah in Dallas
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fans in Dallas always have been laid-back. They are
much like Atlantans, except they have no chance of seeing their
team in the playoffs anytime soon. How then to explain Dallas fans'
strong dislike for new point guard Steve Nash?
</P>
<P>
   Since signing a six-year, $33 million contract extension before
the season and playing far below expectations ever since, the
poor-shooting Nash has been a prime target for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In a display reminiscent of the vicious disapproval aimed at
Kiki Vandeweghe in the 1980s, fans booed Nash loudly and
unrelentingly for most of the Mavericks' recent loss to Houston.
From the moment he missed a 3-pointer with 3:18 left in the opening
half _ the capper to Nash's 0-for-8 start _ he heard boos from a
sizable chunk of the 15,511 in the Reunion Arena crowd almost every
time he touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley came to Nash's defense. ``I'm very disappointed
in the Dallas fans,'' he said. ``What did he do? He's going to be
here a long time. He's a big part of their franchise. He's a good
kid. Why don't they send him down to Houston? We'll take him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whistle-blower
</P>
<P>
   Referee Marc Davis, who whistled a technical foul against Hawks
coach Lenny Wilkens for being out of the coaching box a month ago,
has been busy handing out technicals all year. He might have peaked
in Vancouver when he ejected Denver's Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, paired with Steve Javie, gave McDyess two quick
technicals with 4:46 to play, Vancouver up 86-76. With 2:05 left,
he ticketed Nuggets forward Danny Fortson and tossed him. Then,
Javie, the lead ref, gave Denver coach Mike D'Antoni the hook,
probably to keep him from going after Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Javie had tried to jump in front of Davis to keep him from
tossing Fortson, but Davis stepped around him and gave the ejection
sign.
</P>
<P>
   On joining McDyess and Fortson in the locker room before the end
of the game, D'Antoni said, ``We needed to have a team meeting, and
most of my players were in (there).''
</P>
<P>
   Hawk reject rebounds
</P>
<P>
   Remember Scot Pollard, the backup center the Hawks acquired from
Detroit and then discarded early this season with no chance to
prove himself? Well, Pollard was in the middle of the Kings' gritty
104-101 overtime victory over the Jazz last week.
</P>
<P>
   After playing a total of five minutes in two games, Pollard
stepped in for ailing Chris Webber and produced 11 points, 11
rebounds and four blocks against Karl Malone. It was Pollard who
made the play of the game in overtime with 4.2 seconds left and
Sacramento nursing a 103-101 lead. He drew an offensive foul on
Utah's Bryon Russell that nullified a basket.
</P>
<P>
   Make up your mind
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Richmond told the Washington Post that he wants to stay
with the Wizards, then told a San Francisco Bay Area paper he would
be willing to return to the Warriors, where he began his career.
Richmond, a free agent at the end of the season, said, ``All my
options are open. (Golden State) is the place where I started. My
wife is from here. I'm here in the summertime. And the relationship
I have with (general manager) Garry St. Jean is definitely a plus.
... Over the years, we've kept in touch. He's a friend of the
family. Let's put it this way _ we know each others' pluses and
minuses.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, St. Jean blamed Richmond for ruining his team
in Sacramento when he returned from the '96 Olympics and complained
bitterly that he was underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Cleamons' record in Dallas sagged to 28-70 after he
remade the team, Don Nelson fired him. Nelson's record over his
first 98 games also was 28-70. Nelson will be replaced as coach by
his son, Donn, at season's end. ... A Utah-based quarterhorse owner
and trainer, Wes Giles, named a 2-year-old Ostertag. When Utah
center Greg Ostertag heard, he responded, ``What is he _ big and
slow?'' . . . In the last two weeks, Blazers guard Isaiah Rider has
missed two games for suspensions and not started two games as
discipline for being late to a shootaround and missing practice.
Still, he's ahead of last season, when he was suspended for seven
games and didn't start eight others for disciplinary reasons.

 &HT;    Young star Hoskins set to beat already high standards
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Before Brandi Hoskins became a local celebrity,
basketball had always been an escape for her. Something fun,
something to do, something to take her mind off her mother's
illness and pain. An eighth-grader at MacFarlane Middle School, she
had the audacity to think of the sport as a game.
</P>
<P>
   But now her basketball success has become a burden. Nobody
leaves her alone. College coaches already are writing her letters,
planting seeds, even though she hasn't picked a high school yet.
</P>
<P>
   Just where is she going to high school anyway? Will it be
Chaminade-Julienne, the Catholic school in downtown Dayton,
Pickerington in suburban Columbus or Dunbar in Dayton's City
League? Or maybe somewhere else?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it seems to be everybody's business, to the extent she
quit going to high school games because people kept asking about
her plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to get on my nerves,'' said Hoskins, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Just when there seems no end to the suffocation, here comes
Randy Faison, a community activist and an official with the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, pleading for Hoskins to
choose a predominantly black public school over C-J or
Pickerington.
</P>
<P>
   And if some walls could talk ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been offered coaching jobs and a lot of things I can't
tell you,'' Alan Hoskins, Brandi's father, said. ``But Brandi told
me she can't be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins' talent will sell itself, and that talent is
considerable. Which, of course, explains all the fuss being made
over this eighth-grader who, for the record, says she's leaning
toward C-J, following in the footsteps of Dayton schoolgirl legend
and University of Connecticut star Tamika Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Girls and women's basketball has undergone unprecedented success
in recent years. Although one pro league folded, the Women's
National Basketball Association, backed by the NBA, seems
financially secure. Last month's women's NCAA championship game
drew a record number of viewers. And in Dayton, more than a dozen
area girls received either full or partial basketball scholarships
to Division I colleges during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the attention given to Williams hasn't hurt
basketball's popularity here, either. While at C-J, she was
selected as national player of the year by five different groups,
including Nike and Parade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But if you listen to Williams and many local coaches, the
5-foot-9 Hoskins has the potential to be the most complete girls
player ever to come out of this region.
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins' basketball education began at age 7 when her father
told her to warm up for their Nerf game and she took him literally,
standing next to a heater.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was sweating,'' her father said. ``I said, 'What are you
doing?' She said, 'I'm getting warmed up.' She was getting all
dehydrated. I told her that's not what I meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandi eventually caught on, and her interest in basketball
increased. When her uncle Jeff took her to the Westwood Center, she
more than held her own against boys, one of whom was John
Goldsberry, son of C-J girls basketball coach Frank Goldsberry.
</P>
<P>
   John told his dad he should see this girl play.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to be a fifth-grader at the time I first saw her,''
Goldsberry said. ``Offensively, she was very difficult to stop just
because of all the moves she has.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've seen her game elevate as she's gotten older.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins played for Goldsberry's 11-year-old Amateur Athletic
Union team when she was 9, helping it win the national
championship. She played on another AAU team two years later, again
winning the national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This past season she averaged 37 points for her MacFarlane
eighth-grade team, according to coach Will McKinney. ``She has
overwhelming skills for her age,'' McKinney said. ``Brandi can
shoot and has good range, even from the arc.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Flynn, the director of the Blue Star Elite camp, lives in
Philadelphia and has heard the hype about Hoskins for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard about her game and ability from people on the
outside who watch sports as well as from one of my former players,
Tamika Williams,'' Flynn said. ``She told me she's going to be a
superstar and she's got great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn invites the nation's top freshmen and sophomores to his
July camp. He sometimes adds a few eighth graders, and this year
Hoskins will be one of four.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what high school Hoskins attends, someone will be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to lose some friends in the next couple of
weeks,'' Alan Hoskins said. ``People say C-J just wants her for
basketball, but if any of them are interested in her, it's for
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   And the interest is deep. Pickerington _ which finished this
season as No. 1 in the nation _ Trotwood-Madison, Dunbar, Dayton
Christian and C-J have all invited Brandi to visit their school.
</P>
<P>
   Hoskins and her family have toured the Trotwood-Madison campus
and met the principal, have met students at Dunbar, attended an
open house at C-J and are scheduled to visit Dayton Christian.
</P>
<P>
   It appears C-J will win the sweepstakes. C-J athletic director
Jim Place said Hoskins is already registered for the fall and that
a tuition down payment has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hoskins says he favors C-J. He is bracing for the
ramifications, predicting some of his black friends will have a
problem with Brandi attending the private school.
</P>
<P>
   Faison of the SCLC said Hoskins' ``best opportunity for positive
socialization'' is to attend Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should continue to stay in the Dayton Public Schools,''
Faison said. ``It has excellent academic programs, and she will
receive the support she needs. Brandi Hoskins, like a number of
other children, has had a wonderful experience athletically and
educationally in the Dayton Public Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Faison has met with the Hoskins, but Brandi's mother, Toni, said
she believes C-J is where her daughter can get the best education.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the pile of letters from colleges grows deeper.
</P>
<P>
   They bear the signatures of coaches from Dayton, Ohio State,
Duke, Purdue and Iowa, among others. Alan Hoskins has a special
fondness for the handwritten pieces, like the one Dayton coach Jaci
Clark sent after attending one of Brandi's junior high games.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the letter was meant to show support for the young
player. ``I would never want to interfere with the process of
growing up,'' she said. ``I just wanted to encourage her with the
gift she has and tell her to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hoskins is his daughter's personal chauffeur, driving her
across the country to play in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   He's driven her to Florida, to Oklahoma and to Richmond, Va.,
last Thursday to play in the Blue Chip Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk, we argue,'' he said. ``I like it when she sleeps. I
like music from my era, she likes music from her era.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brandi isn't listening to music or sleeping during these
excursions, she's dreaming about her mother, wishing she could come
along.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Hoskins has rarely seen her daughter play and never travels
across the country to her games because she is disabled and all but
a shut-in. The 32-year-old mother of two has cirrhosis, a
life-threatening disease of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital visits are routine for Toni, who will probably need a
transplanted liver.
</P>
<P>
   Toni's illness doesn't appear to have affected Brandi on the
court, but Brandi said it's something she often thinks about. So
before she goes on a basketball trip, she makes sure to hug her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me a lot when she's in pain,'' Brandi said. ``My
mom is like my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni prays she will be able to watch Brandi fulfill her
potenial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grace of God gets me by,'' she said. ``Brandi cries about
it more than me.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons between Williams and Hoskins are inevitable.
Both are tall _ Hoskins is already 5 feet 9, Williams 6-2 _ and
have good all-around games.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more of an outside player and I'm more inside,'' said
Williams, recently named freshman of the year by The Sporting News.
``But she has the same demeanor. We'll battle to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsberry shies away from comparing the two, preferring instead
to wait and see how Hoskins adjusts to the high-school game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first day of practice, I'll go from there,'' he
said. ``I haven't seen her play enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, if Hoskins needs advice on how to deal with the
typical problems of a budding superstar teen-age athlete, she can
call Williams, who has become a mentor and close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's almost like a little sister,'' Williams said. ``I just
tell her things, from boys to grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her, `Every record I have, I want you to break. I want
you to set a standard.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She already has.

 &HT;    Masters taking tougher course
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ They still will need to prepare for the sadistic,
slippery greens with practice putts on a kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   They still will exit off Interstate 20 to Washington Road and
turn into Magnolia Lane.
</P>
<P>
   They still will get peach cobbler on the lunch menu.
</P>
<P>
   They still will see Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead
starting things off on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, the participants of the 63rd Masters might not
recognize the Augusta National Golf Club during the 1999 Masters.
In terms of ``winds of change,'' this is a gust.
</P>
<P>
   Alterations to the hallowed grounds carved by Alister MacKenzie
and Bobby Jones are nothing new _ a pond used to front the No. 6
green and a ditch crossed the 17th tee. But not since 1980, when
the greens were switched from Bermuda to bentgrass, have there been
so many changes that could change the face, or at least the
scoring, of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rather progressive Masters chairman on the grounds.
Hootie Johnson replaced Jack Stephens, who retired.
</P>
<P>
   There have been significant changes to four holes _ 2, 11, 15
and 17 _ that have added demands on length and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   There's more than a token ``second cut'' outside Augusta
National's generous fairways. The ``flier rough,'' as the players
are calling it, has been allowed to grow to 1 3/8 inches, from
5/8ths of an inch, and will prevent players from putting backspin
on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   From a playing standpoint, the rough could be the biggest
change. For nearly two decades, the reward for negotiating Augusta
National's treacherous bentgrass greens _ by air or on the ground _
has been the near-guarantee of a perfect lie just about anywhere on
the property.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the second cut could play a big, big role in the golf
tournament, actually,'' said David Duval, runner-up to Mark O'Meara
in 1998. ``It should make it very, very interesting on those hard,
fast greens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to get on those greens from the rough would be a
nightmare,'' Tom Lehman predicted when the plan was in its
experiment phase.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think the changes were prompted by Tiger Woods'
record score of 270 in 1997. Woods' length off the tee almost
brought Augusta National to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval is not sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't grasped where that concern has come from,''
he said. ``I think if anybody had read stuff about it and heard the
outcry, that you'd have thought that Tiger had broken the
tournament record by five or six shots and just blew all these
things out of the water. . . . In all fairness, he made a three- or
four-foot putt on the last hole to beat the tournament record by
one. So it must go back to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the changes were made to help protect the tournament
for the future. High-tech clubs and balls have made the par-5s at
Augusta nearly obsolete. Something had to be done to the only major
that returns to the same venue every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of the club, we've made approximately 75
changes,'' Johnson said. ``We've moved some tees up and some tees
back. We've put in bunkers, and we've taken out bunkers. . . . But,
yes, part of our reasoning or rationale for these changes is that
these young men are hitting the ball a lot longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players accept the changes. ``The course gets better and
better every year, and you have to have (changes) like that;
otherwise the scoring would be lower and lower,'' said Spain's Jose
Maria Olazabal, the 1994 champion.
</P>
<P>
   The hole changes for 1999:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2, par 5, 575 yards: The tee was moved back 25 yards and
surrounded by a stone wall. The right fairway bunker was shifted to
the right and brought more into play.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11, par 4, 455 yards: Chiefly for flood control, the green
was raised approximately two feet, the pond about one foot. Rae's
Creek also was widened by about 50 percent. Two bunkers behind and
to the right of the green have been replaced by a single bunker.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 15, par 5, 500 yards: Fairway mounds on the right side
that could ``slingshot'' drives were reduced about 80 percent and
20 pine trees were added. Mounds on the right side of the green
were removed and six pine trees planted.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 17, par 4, 425 yards: The tee was moved back 25 yards and
a cluster of pine trees planted on the right, putting the
Eisenhower Pine on the left side, about 195 yards down the fairway,
in a larger role.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th, from pre-tournament reaction, clearly is the hole most
affected. Not everyone is prepared to hug architect Tom Fazio, who
designed the alterations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The huge difference is 17,'' said Atlanta's Billy Andrade, who
played the course in February. ``It makes you hook it off the tee,
and it's tight. The Eisenhower tree comes more into play; those
trees on the right come into play. It's going to make that hole a
lot more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price said he thinks that the extra yardage was not
necessary at the 17th, that adding the trees on the right would
have been enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That green is not designed for a 5-iron,'' said Price, who
shot 63 in the 1986 Masters. ``And downwind now, instead of us
mortals hitting wedge or 9-iron, we're going to be hitting 7-iron.
No way are you going to be able to stop it on that green.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes at 15 aren't likely to cause an uproar. With people
hitting short irons into a par-5, something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand those humps are gone, which is kind of good,''
Tom Lehman said. ``You could be 4 yards short of the next guy (and
not get the slingshot effect), and some guy will drive it 80 yards
past you. I think it will probably make the course more fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The new No. 2 seems to have the most potential to please the
majority of the players. Although the hole is lengthened, the new
angle allows more players to thread a drive into the chute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (No.) 2 is great,'' said Andrade. ``I still think the
big hitters will be able to get home, but it actually makes the
fairway wider for the average hitter. Before you were trying to hit
a hook around there, and it was tight. Now it's open more. It gives
you a little breathing room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long hitter, the (No. 2) fairway was maybe 90 yards
wide,'' said Tom Lehman. ``For me, the fairway was maybe 25 yards
wide. And I'm not short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit some 3 and 4-irons into that green, and I won't be
able to do that anymore,'' Justin Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on which day you speak with Greg Norman, the response
may differ. While telling one reporter recently that he considers
the changes ``very well balanced and needed from the standpoint of
15, 17 and 2, especially,'' he told another that he feels any
alterations are messing with the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to step on the tee and say, `Gene Sarazen did this,'
or, `Byron Nelson did this,' and feel the same piece of nostalgia
and history,'' Norman said. ``When you change it, you change all of
that.

 &HT;    Course as masterpiece
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By the end of this week, one of the hundreds of
journalists covering the Masters might write that Augusta National
architect Alister MacKenzie is spinning in his grave over the newly
grown rough and four lengthened holes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the auld Scottish doctor ever got annoyed in the
hereafter, it was probably because he never was paid properly for
his Depression-era design, according to a new book about the
course. MacKenzie and tournament co-founders Bobby Jones and
Clifford Roberts always viewed the course as a work in progress,
and over the years the suggestions of everyone from members to
spectators to sportswriters, even, have resulted in about 75
alterations to the fabled course.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the tweaking, Augusta National annually stages one
of sport's most dramatic finishes because the spirit of MacKenzie's
philosophy is still intact, confirming his place as one of the
greatest architects in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He never lived to see that kind of recognition for his work at
Augusta and died with paltry financial reward for his efforts. When
writer David Owen began researching his newly released book, ``The
Making of the Masters,'' he knew Augusta National had a rocky
start. The extent of the bad times startled him, as he discovered
documentation that included tempestuous, sometimes grimly humorous,
correspondence from MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things he said were exaggerations for humorous
effect,'' Owen said. ``But it wasn't like Augusta National was a
rich club ignoring MacKenzie. All the people were trying to make
ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Depression, Augusta National had an immensely
difficult time securing members, despite Jones' fame as the winner
of golf's Grand Slam and one of the most popular athletes of the
times. The club's archives are full of rejection letters from
businessmen who were invited to join. Facing a shortfall in funds,
grandiose plans for a grand country club were cut back to 18 golf
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Even those plans were tentative in 1931 when MacKenzie started
laying out the course over the grounds of an old nursery. The
members did not commit to build the course until early 1932.
MacKenzie reduced his fee from $10,000 to $5,000 to speed the
project, which he viewed as his finest achievement.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1932, the course had been open for several months and
MacKenzie had been paid only $2,000, not even enough to cover his
estimated expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am at the end of my tether,'' he wrote Roberts from his
California home. ``No one has paid me a cent since last June, we
have mortgaged everything we have and have not yet been able to pay
the nursing expenses of my wife's operation. . . . Can you possibly
let me have, at any rate, $500 to keep us out of the poor house?''
</P>
<P>
   With greens fees barely covering the payroll, the club didn't
have any money. A few months later, MacKenzie wrote again, saying
that his electricity and phone were about to be cut off and he
feared foreclosure on his house. Perhaps the worst indignity: ``I
have been reduced to playing golf with four clubs and a Woolworth
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   To save pennies, he and his wife started trimming each other's
hair and gathering fallen wood to heat their home. In 1934, the
63-year-old MacKenzie suffered a brief illness and died suddenly,
having never played Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his spirit shaped the history of the invitational tournament
started that same year. MacKenzie and Jones held the same
philosophy of design, that a course should be rewarding, not
punitive; beautiful, not artificial; surprising, but not unfair.
MacKenzie achieved those design goals by working with the land, not
merely moving it, and created two masterpieces of great natural
beauty: the heavily flowered Amen Corner at Augusta National and
the spectacular Pacific Coast views of Cypress Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his courses that I have played have been interesting; in
every instance he has placed interest and enjoyment ahead of
difficulty,'' Jones later wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That sensibility dictated Augusta National's appearance and
play. MacKenzie hated for a player to look for a lost ball, so he
designed wide fairways with many routes to the green. An errant
drive could be nullified by an excellent second shot, and it is
those approaches that require a panoply of shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The large, heavily contoured greens are so demanding that they
offer only a few spots where a player can expect a birdie, and they
influence the placement of the approach shot and the drive. Like
the bunkers, the greens are more deceptive than they look, a legacy
from MacKenzie's days in the British military as a camouflage
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one who very much equated the game of golf to life, and
he believed that the design of the golf course should parallel
that,'' said Denis Griffiths of Braselton, the designer of Chateau
Elan and former president of the American Society of Golf Course
Architects. Griffiths had just finished reading MacKenzie's book
``The Spirit of St. Andrews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Variety, excitement, disappointment were elements of the game,
and his design radiated that,'' Griffiths said. ``Fairness was not
necessarily part of the game, and if you look at Augusta National
and see what happens on the greens, that's evident. . . . Just when
you think everything is going great, there's going to be a
catastrophe on a MacKenzie course. The golfer is continually
challenged and expects the unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, MacKenzie's legacy will entice the best
players in the world into one of sport's most dramatic finishes.
Augusta National's array of back-nine birdie chances means that the
leader at the turn must attack the course, a very different
scenario from the finish at the next stop on golf's Grand Slam, the
U.S. Open. The host courses are so penal that par almost always is
a good score, and the winner is usually a plodding survivor.
</P>
<P>
   At Augusta National, Owen said, ``The back nine on Sunday is the
epitome of what MacKenzie and Jones were trying to do. They wanted
to present situations where the superior player can demonstrate his
superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the par 3s and par 5s. Based on length alone, the
145-yard 12th hole should be a pushover. But Rae's Creek, the
swirling winds and the slope of the green creates a narrow margin
of error.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the pond-fronted 16th. Second-generation
golf-course architect Rees Jones was 7 years old when his father,
Robert Trent Jones, helped redesign it. ``The thing about it,
there's no place to miss it,'' he said. ``If you're above the hole,
it's treacherous, and you can't miss it left. You can get in real
trouble in the water there and on 15, which make a kind of
make-or-break finale. It may be one of the top dozen par-3s in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Both 13 and 15, the par 5s, can be reached in two, which Jones
insisted upon, and MacKenzie concurred. They dangled that reward to
the long hitters, while entertaining the members with a hole that
wasn't terribly long.
</P>
<P>
   During the years, MacKenzie's original design has weathered
technological improvement, including lawn mowers that shave the
greens to a whisker's length, making them faster than he ever
envisioned. The pros who first played Augusta National considered
it insufferably long, because its state-of-the-art watering system
cut down on how far the ball rolled. Today, the long hitters, such
as runaway 1997 Masters champion Tiger Woods, threaten to make some
of the holes pitifully short, which is why four holes were
lengthened this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Augusta National remains a place where spectators are as
apt to talk about the course as they are about the players, and
that too is a credit to the man who never got much of it when he
was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A course like this really doesn't just happen,'' Griffiths
said. ``You wish it could happen in every design. It all fits
together. If we all experience this at least once in a round of
golf, we've done well.

 &HT;    Hollins had role at start
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No women belong to Augusta National Golf Club. But at
one point, the course's development was in the hands of Marion
Hollins, a woman far ahead of her time.
</P>
<P>
   Newly discovered correspondence that fills out the history of
Augusta National, home of the Masters, says that the course's
architect, Alister MacKenzie, sent Hollins to oversee construction
because he held her opinion in such high esteem. Her name already
might be familiar to those steeped in Masters lore, because she
played an important role in bringing together MacKenzie and Masters
co-founder Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   David Owen, the author of a new book called ``The Making of the
Masters,'' discovered Hollins' added influence in an old letter
between MacKenzie and Augusta National's other co-founder, Clifford
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians describe Hollins as the dominant female athlete
of the 1920s, the counterpart to Masters co-founder Bobby Jones in
the ranks of women's golf. She was a long-hitting winner of the
1921 U.S. Amateur, a race-car driver and a polo player who competed
against men.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a totally unintimidated figure who stood out at that
time, a larger-than-life figure in any era, but especially in the
20s,'' Owen said. ``She was an amazing athlete and a real
visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a wealthy New Yorker, Hollins moved to
California to help promote the fledgling golf courses on the
Monterey Peninsula. It was mostly her idea to build Cypress Point,
considered one of the game's greatest gems, and she suggested
MacKenzie as the architect.
</P>
<P>
   The course's signature hole is the long par-3 16th, with its
carry over a jagged inlet of the Pacific Ocean. MacKenzie credited
Hollins with that hole's design, because she erased doubts that the
challenge was too severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Hollins said she did not think it was an impossible
carry,'' MacKenzie wrote later. ``She then teed up a ball and drove
to the middle of the site for the suggested green.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollins went on to build her own golf course _ Pasatiempo,
Spanish for ``passing of time'' _ near San Francisco, and it also
was designed by MacKenzie. Its opening in 1929 featured an
exhibition by Hollins and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones played because he had unexpected free time. He had just
lost his first match in the U.S. Amateur at what is now Pebble
Beach. On the same trip, he played Cypress Point, and he was
smitten with MacKenzie's designs. He got a chance to walk and chat
with MacKenzie as he golfed with Hollins at Pasatiempo.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, MacKenzie started work on Augusta National.
When Roberts complained that he wasn't spending enough time on
site, MacKenzie sent Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are her own ideas valuable, but she is thoroughly
conversant in regard to the character of work I like,'' MacKenzie
wrote Roberts. ``I want her views and also her personal impressions
in regard to the way the work is being carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another idea that Jones and Roberts borrowed from Hollins was to
hire the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted _ the designer of Central
Park in New York and Piedmont Park in Atlanta _ as their landscape
architect. ``In a lot of ways it seemed likely that they were
inspired either directly or indirectly by what she had done at
Pasatiempo,'' Owen said. ``There are so many parallels between what
she did and what Jones and Roberts later did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollins was at her zenith during her brief stint at Augusta. The
year before, in the middle of the Depression, she had made $2.5
million on an oil deal. She sunk much of it into Pasatiempo,
turning it into a playground for some of Hollywood's biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the course ultimately drained her. In 1937, Hollins wrecked
her car and went into a physical and financial tailspin. She lost
her course and, despite a brief return to competitive golf, died of
cancer in 1944 at age 51. Today, Pasatiempo survives as one of the
best public courses in America _ and the forerunner of Augusta
National. For the flamboyant Hollins, that would have been
something to brag about

 &HT;    Woods happy at No. 2
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Tiger Woods left Augusta National in 1997 with
the 42-long green jacket, people assumed that he would collect a
wardrobe full of them by his 30s. Combined with all those Sunday
red shirts, surely his closet would look like Christmas in April.
</P>
<P>
   A source no less credible than Jack Nicklaus said Woods would
secure more Masters titles than he and Arnold Palmer combined (10),
prompting the question: Who's going to beat Tiger on those other
years?
</P>
<P>
   And now comes the answer: Well, maybe David Duval, for one. It
is doubtful to count on the same effort each year from defending
champion Mark O'Meara, but it certainly appears that Duval could
challenge for another 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome a challenge,'' Woods said. ``That's why we play out
here. I know that's why I play _ to challenge myself and hopefully
come out on top against the best players. And to know I've beaten
the best, that makes it even sweeter.''
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? Woods hasn't beaten the best since the '97
Masters. He came closest at last year's British Open, when he lost
by one stroke and beat everybody but O'Meara. Clearly, the pressure
is on for Tiger to contend this year at Augusta. If he has another
bad outing, fans are going to wonder if winning by 12 and beating
the all-time scoring record in '97 was his future or his fantasy
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Duval replaced Woods at the top of the world rankings
last Sunday _ rankings that few seem to respect _ the new No. 1
doubts that his most serious rival will just vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all regard Tiger in a very high manner,'' said
Duval, who seems genuinely excited about whatever rivalry develops
in the coming years. ``His abilities to play this game are
unbelievable. Any time my name has been put in the hat as far as (a
rivalry with Woods), I find that flattering. You're talking about a
great, great golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who chose not to defend his BellSouth title and stayed at
his home course in Orlando to play with O'Meara, is hoping that
formula works for him again. If he shoots a 59 again this week _
like he did in a practice round with O'Meara in '97, Augusta could
be his playground after a quiet tie for eighth in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can get my game to where it will be ready to go,
clicking on all cylinders,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods displayed significantly better distance control and played
more consistently in 1998 _ 13 top 10s in 20 appearances _ but he
won only once. And there have been changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ He fired agent Hughes Norton of International Management.
</P>
<P>
   _ He fired his caddie, Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan,'' replacing him
with New Zealander Steve Williams.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has a girlfriend, Jauna Jagoda from California, who wasn't
with him last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods is not convinced that it's he and Duval vs. the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to say that right now,'' Woods said. ``If I
was playing as well as I had in 1996, 1997, when I won a few
tournaments . . . it would be kind of neat to go head-to-head that
way. But as far as dominant, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Duval's ascension might help Woods in the long run. He
doesn't react well to being pulled in all directions _ example, at
the 1997 U.S. Open, when he would not talk with reporters after a
bad opening round. As long as he remains golf's greatest marketing
draw, not necessarily its best player, Woods seems reasonably
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish (the spotlight) was more on David,'' Woods said. ``I
mean, he's one of my friends out here, and it's nice that he has
actually played some great golf. But it has also been a big lift
off me, because it has taken some of the media requests that I've
had to do historically and put them on him. And now he's gotten a
little taste of it. It's very difficult to do, balance all of that.
When you're out here working, you're trying to get ready for a
tournament. It's difficult to be tugged and pulled and try and find
enough energy to play in a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't be a problem this week. Enough patience to handle
Duval could be another story.

 &HT;    Little tenure in coaching
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For several minutes, Phoenix general manager Bobby
Smith had been doing his best to smother thoughts that his hockey
coach lacked job security. Smith attributed a recent slump to
injuries. He blamed some losses on a since-demoted backup
goaltender. He said rumors of a coach's imminent firing ``are a
great way to undermine a hockey team. It gives players an excuse to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the general manager said something that seemed to indicate
that Coyotes coach Jim Schoenfeld had better look over his shoulder
after all. Asked if Schoenfeld's future was tied to the postseason,
Smith said, ``I think we all know the importance of the playoffs _
for every team, but particularly us, since we've never made it past
the first round of the playoffs. The entire makeup of our team
could be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months ago, Schoenfeld was on track to be
honored as coach of the year. Phoenix started the season 17-3-3 and
looked like a serious threat for the Stanley Cup. But the Coyotes
have played less than .500 hockey since _ including a 2-11 stretch
_ and Schoenfeld now finds himself at the core of the NHL's annual
spring fever: coaches on the firing line.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching positions might be less stable in hockey than in any of
the other three major pro sports. At least nine teams _ Phoenix,
Carolina, Chicago, Edmonton, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York
Islanders, Philadelphia and Tampa Bay _ are contemplating coaching
changes, as well as Detroit, where Scotty Bowman may retire. Three
coaches -- Vancouver's Mike Keenan, Chicago's Dirk Graham and the
Islanders' Mike Milbury, who as coach-GM fired himself from the
bench _ already have been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Six teams changed coaches before this season, four others midway
through last season. Excluding first-year Nashville, 19 of 26
coaches are in their first or second season with the team.
Schoenfeld is in the second year of a three-year deal and there
have been no extension talks. The Coyotes haven't made it to round
two of the playoffs since they were the Winnipeg Jets in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld might think that two years is a short tenure, but
it's twice as long as that of his predecessor, Don Hay.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches on the hit list:
</P>
<P>
   _ Larry Robinson, Los Angeles. Robinson turned down a contract
extension before the season, and the chances of him seeing that
offer again are slim. The Kings fizzled this season and have made
the playoffs only once in Robinson's four years. The team is moving
into a new building and has a season-ticket base this year of only
8,500. Few question Robinson's coaching ability, but some people
think that he lacks the temperament and patience to be a head
coach, having even expressed self-doubt after some losses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jacques Demers, Tampa Bay. The league's only remaining
coach-general manager most certainly will lose at least one of his
titles and possibly both. The team is under the new ownership of
Bill Davidson, and Demers is part of the old regime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roger Neilson, Philadelphia. The Flyers have had six coaches
in the last seven seasons, so there's a point at which changing
loses credibility with fans. The problem is that another playoff
failure could lead to general manager Bob Clarke's exit. Owner Ed
Snider is losing patience. If Clarke's gone, Neilson probably would
follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alain Vigneault, Montreal. The Canadiens have personnel
problems, which probably makes general manager Rejean Houle less
secure than Vigneault. But in the demanding province of Quebec,
nonplayoff seasons rarely have survivors. Montreal has had nine
coaches since Scotty Bowman left in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul Maurice, Carolina. The Hurricanes probably will win the
Southeast Division, but they could lose in the first round to a
lower seed like the Flyers. Maurice failed to make the playoffs his
first two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Stewart, N.Y. Islanders. Milbury replaced himself with
Bill Stewart, who might have talked his way out of the job by
bringing up the team's shallow talent pool and financial problems
after a recent loss.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lorne Molleken, Chicago. Promoted from assistant when Graham
was axed, Molleken has support from some of the players. It might
not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ron Low, Edmonton. General manager Glen Sathers keeps saying
that the Oilers' problems aren't Low's fault and that the coach is
safe. The first part of that sentence is true.

 &HT;    Panthers acquire damaged goods
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turns out the Florida Panthers might have been
victimized by more than bad luck when Pavel Bure required
season-ending knee surgery. How about stupidity? Team orthopedist
David Attarian told the Palm Beach Post that Bure's first
reconstructive surgery in 1995 ``set him up for a series of
injuries.'' It turns out that when Bure joined the Panthers in New
York in January after the trade with Vancouver, Florida general
manager Brian Murray had the forward examined by a New Jersey team
physician. Attarian didn't examine Bure until the team returned to
Florida a few days later. Attarian said that when he performed
arthroscopic surgery on Bure's knee last month he could see that
the original reconstructive surgery had failed. Attarian said ``a
lot of information was never made public.'' In fact, the discovery
was known by only three people _ Attarian, Murray and team
president Bill Torrey. Murray didn't even tell his brother, Terry
Murray, who happens to coach the team. Attarian backed off his
comments the next day, saying, ``I thought the risk of injury was
the same as any other player in the NHL.'' But after the admitted
earlier deception, who was going to believe him or anybody in the
organization? At the very least, Brian Murray can't look good in
the eyes of owner Wayne Huizenga _ especially with the Panthers
having just given a five-year, $46.5 million contract to a player
who has had two knee reconstructions in four years.

   Islanders interim coach Bill Stewart angered management this
past week when, after a loss to the Rangers, he said his team
didn't ``have the resources'' to compete. ``Certainly, if we had
the resources to acquire NHL talent, would it be a different story?
You answer the question. . . . Have you looked at our lineup?
Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.

   Rumors persist that coach Alain Vigneault won't be the only
casualty in Montreal after the season and that team president
Ronald Corey will clean house and elevate adviser Jacques Lemaire
to general manager. Lemaire has said he didn't want the job,
currently occupied by his close friend, Rejean Houle. . . . After a
loss to Nashville, Tampa coach Jacques Demers made his players stay
in their uniforms and skates while watching lowlights of the game
on videotape. . . . Florida's Dino Ciccarelli, 39, has been told by
a spine specialist to rest his ailing back for two months, and it's
unlikely the team will bring him back next season . . .
Pittsburgh's Matthew Barnaby, unpopular in the Buffalo locker room
before being traded, had his eye blacked and two teeth loosened
after being punched by ex-teammate Rob Ray in a game. . . . Ottawa
forward Andreas Johansen hit a $75,000 incentive bonus when he
scored his 20th goal and celebrated by taking his teammates out to
dinner. ``That's what happens,'' he said, ``when you get a bonus
and guys read about it in the paper.''

<P>
   On his decision to bypass free agency and sign a contract
extension: ``I knew everybody in my family was happy to stay in
Colorado. I was happy with the numbers, and Colorado was my first
choice for many reasons. I'm happy with the direction of the team,
getting people like (Theo) Fleury and (Dale) Hunter. They proved
that they are thinking about winning the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing this team to the Avalanche Stanley Cup teamof 1996:
``The year we won the Cup, we knew we had to beat Detroit to have a
chance. This year you have at least eight or nine very solid teams
that believe they have a chance to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   On last year's playoff collapse: ``The Olympics really hurt our
team. Emotionally, it was tough on our coach (Marc Crawford) and
some of our players. But this year everybody is confident and
fresh. I'm not saying we're going to win the Stanley Cup, but I
believe we should have a good playoff run.''

scouting at the World Championships in Norway at the time, but the
team will send a representative to New York. The Thrashers will
pick no lower than third and as high as first. They will be
weighted in the lottery to pick second, behind only the team that
finishes with the worst record (probably Tampa Bay). They will pick
second in all other rounds.

 &HT;    No Flame-out from Sutter
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA Calgary's Brian Sutter won't get any consideration for
coach of the year, but no coach is doing more with less right now.
When the Flames traded Theo Fleury to Colorado, most people
projected the team's playoff death. But Calgary still had a hold on
the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference after going 7-5-2
in its first 14 games after the Fleury trade; Calgary was 21-30-10
before the deal. One reason is the goaltending of Ken Wregget, who
has lost only four of 12 starts since returning from a back injury.
Three of the losses were by 2-1 scores. But the biggest reason is
Sutter, who has managed to hold together one of the lowest-paid,
talent-starved teams in the league, despite an eight-game losing
streak in December. In addition to losing Fleury, their best player
and spiritual leader, the Flames have been decimated by injuries.
But the Flames even earned a tie recently vs. Colorado _ and
Fleury. Sutter, once thought to be on the firing line after the
season, has the players' support, and it would difficult for
managment to justify a change. Sutter also is the lowest-paid NHL
coach, at $278,885. ``I've definitely learned more about how to win
with Brian than anyone else,'' center Andrew Cassels said.
</P>
<P>
   Hot wing
</P>
<P>
   Amid the euphoria caused by Detroit's winning ways after trades
for Chris Chelios and others, it should be noted that the biggest
reason for the upswing is Sergei Fedorov. The talented but
sometimes enigmatic Russian has played so well of late _ five goals
in six games, 23 points and a plus-seven in the last 20 _ that he
has earned praise even from coach Scotty Bowman. That's no easy
feat. ``He's playing a solid two-way game. And he's putting some
pressure on the other team's defensemen when he carries the puck.
He's been forcing the other team into making mistakes.'' . . .
Wings owner Mike Ilitch on the deals for the old and high-salaried
Chelios, Wendel Clark, Ulf Samuelsson and Bill Ranford: ``I'm
always concerned with payroll, but when it comes down to the 1-yard
line, you weigh the payroll and weigh all the other things that go
with it and the possibility of having a shot at winning the Stanley
Cup. You tell yourself it's going to be an expensive venture, it's
a dangerous venture, it's a risk, but we're risk-takers.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   From Nashville tough guy Patrick Cote after scoring his first
NHL goal: ``Now I've cracked the ice, and I can go for a second
one. By the way, I'm still going to fight.'' . . . Phoenix's Robert
Reichel had six goals and three assists in his first six games
after being traded by the Islanders. But Reichel, who will be a
restricted free agent this summer and will command well over $2
million annually, is considering returning to his native Czech
Republic. . . . Pretty startling admission by Colorado's Claude
Lemieux after the acquisition of tough guy Dale Hunter: ``Everybody
knows we're a pretty passive club when it comes to emotion.'' . . .
Flashback: When Quebec, later Colorado, traded Hunter to Washington
in 1987, the Nordiques received two players and a No. 1 draft pick,
who turned out to be Joe Sakic.

   BBO-MLB-OPENER _ The baseball season opens in Mexico for the
first time, as the Padres play the Mets on Sunday night. (Stinson,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   REDS-PREVIEW _ There is new optimism with the Reds fans because
so much has changed. There is the cosmetic _ new-look caps and
added facial hair. But some changes are more substantive. A
50-homer outfielder in Greg Vaughn. And two proven starting
pitchers _ Steve Avery and Denny Neagle. Add those players to a
team that already has Pete Harnisch and Barry Larkin alongside a
young nucleus _ Sean Casey and Dmitri Young _ and you can see why
the Reds fans believe this team can compete in the weak National
League Central. (McCoy, Dayton Daily News). 25. WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   BBO-LEMKE _ Mark Lemke can't remember the collision in Boston
last May that turned his life upside down. The next eight months of
headaches and misery are something he wishes he could forget. Now
the former Atlanta Braves second baseman says he is feeling fine
again, but he is out of the game he loves. Lemke works out each day
and waits for agent Lonnie Cooper's phone to ring. ``I'm not ready
to retire,'' says Lemke, 33. (Curtright, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25. MOVED

   BBN-JORDAN _ Like most professional baseball players, Braves
outfielder Brian Jordan, obtained from St. Louis during the
offseason, had to make a decision on what sport to play. Jordan's
decision came later than most. Jordan played pro baseball and
football before opting for a baseball career. We profile his career
and let him explain what went into his decision. (Rogers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 45. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBN-DONBAYLOR _ Chances are the Atlanta Braves would have made
no moves with the coaching staff until former Colorado manager Don
Baylor became available. Braves GM John Schuerholz saw the
opportunity to bring Baylor to Atlanta as a hitting coach and
jumped at the chance. Baylor saw the opportunity to join a
high-caliber team in a high-caliber TV market and figured the
exposure wouldn't hurt his resume. Baylor is expected to work with
Atlanta's young hitters _ Klesko and A.Jones _ in an effort to
eliminate easy outs from the lineup. But he's also sitting a few
feet from Braves manager Bobby Cox, who has drawn some criticism
for Atlanta's poor playoff performances. (Rogers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 50. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBN-LATINOS-BRAVES _ After ``mining'' Javy Lopez from Latin
America, the Braves made a conscious effort to set up shop there
with a minor league facility. The result, in part, has been a
strong Latin contingency on the 1999 team that includes Lopez,
Andres Galarraga, Eddie Perez, Bruce Chen, Andruw Jones and Ozzie
Guillen. (Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 30. MOVED

   BBN-LATINOS-CULTURE _ In one corner of the Braves' clubhouse,
the Latin American players are speaking Spanish. In another, the
Americans are playing cards. What is the process for building a
team chemistry when the players are split among nationalities?
(Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18. MOVED

   BBO-HANK-CHASE _ Those who were around 25 years ago during Hank

   BBO-HANKSIDE _ The ball, the bat, the uniform from Hank Aaron's
chase of Ruth. Where are they and what would they be worth on
today's memorabilia market? (Rosen, Atlanta Journal-Constituion).
12. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-HITTING _ When we left Atlanta during the playoffs
last year, Bobby Cox still was tinkering with his lineup, still
looking for a true leadoff hitter and still trying to hide outs.
With the addition of Brian Jordan, Bret Boone and Otis Nixon, the
Braves appear stronger. But how will the order shape up? (Stinson,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-CATCHING _ Andruw Jones has turned into one of the
best defensive center fielders in baseball. Period. We let
teammates and opponents wax eloquent about how good this guy is.
(Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-PITCHING _ After spending most of its payroll on
starting pitching, Atlanta jettisoned Denny Neagle during the
offseason, moved Kevin Millwood into the No. 4 spot and will use
rookie Bruce Chen in the fifth spot. What if it Millwood and Chen
fail? (Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-THEPEN _ Still a question mark, but the Braves are
tired of hearing it. With Mark Wohlers in limbo, what does the pen
offer in times of need? (Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.
MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BBO-BASEBALL-STATUS _ When we last left baseball, Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa were hitting huge home runs, and the New York
Yankees were winning a World Series. Baseball, everyone said, was
back. But was it? Attendance in 1998 increased by 500 a game _ and
that's with the addition of a new franchise. Fox and the Murdoch
group, as feared, was beginning to push a baseball payroll to $96
million, almost $30 million more than any other club. Certainly the
McGwire story meant a lot to the game, but the sport seems dead set
on shooting itself in the foot. That could come sooner than later.
(Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50. MOVED

<P>
   BBO-SLUGGERS _ It has become the era of the slugger. With Sosa,
McGwire, Griffey Jr., etc., how does this era rate in baseball

   GLF-MASTERS-CHANGE _ Augusta National Golf Club made some very
important changes to the course since the 1998 tournament. Here is

<P>
   GLF-MASTERS-HISTORY _ When Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts
decided to build a course in Augusta in the early 1930s, both men
immediately contacted golf course architect Alister McKenzie in
California. Jones had played McKenzie's crown jewels _ Cypress
Point at Pebble Beach and Pasatiempo in Santa Cruz and several
European courses _ and was impressed with his work. For McKenzie,
disaster followed. For three years or so, he put his life into
Augusta and went broke in the process. Because of Augusta's dire
financial situation in the early years, McKenzie was forced to
literally beg for money that never came. He died shortly before the
first Masters tournament in 1939. (Hiskey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GLF-MASTERS-HOLLINS _ Don't think it's well known that the owner
of Pasatiempo, a woman, was McKenzie's apprentice during the vision
for laying out Augusta National. In fact, McKenzie sent her on two
occasions to Augusta to look at the lay of the land before
construction began. When Bobby Jones balked at McKenize sending
``an apprentice'' to help out, McKenzie wrote to Jones that Ms.
Marion Hollins was, in his opinion, as good a golf designer as
anyone in the world. She also was a good golfer _ the 1921 U.S.
Amateur champion. (Hiskey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20. MOVED

   MASTERS-SHOPPING _ AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Augusta, Ga., is known for
it's famous country club and golf tournament, the Masters. However,
there's also plenty to do there besides watch a little dimpled
white ball soard through the air _ like, shop. The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution has produced a full page layout for use during

Something fun, something to do, something to take her mind off her

School, she had the audacity to think of the sport as a game. But
now it's getting confusing. Nobody leaves her alone. She hasn't yet
said where she'll attend high school and college coaches already
are writing her letters, planting seeds. This is the story of how
one girl's decision has become everybody's business. (Lance, Dayton

   WASHINGTON _ A few hours before U.S. cruise missiles struck
downtown Belgrade on Friday night, President Clinton met with his
top advisers in the Cabinet Room of the White House, and weighed
what one White House official who was at the meeting described
Saturday as the fundamental question: ``Can our air power make
Milosevic sue for peace?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no answer yet,'' the official said. Nevertheless,
Clinton has approved continuing attacks in and around Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, hoping that high-tech weapons can break the will of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be able to answer for a week or two,'' said the
official, who attended the meeting and discussed it on condition of
anonymity. ``We haven't turned the heat up enough. That is the
heart of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton authorized the sixth concerted cruise-missile attack on
a foreign city of his presidency _ and the first on a European
capital _ in what is now being judged as perhaps the most difficult
foreign-policy problem he has confronted.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a test of what amounts to the Clinton Doctrine: using
air power to try to coerce political change abroad at little or no
risk to U.S. soldiers. His cruise-missile diplomacy now faces a
grim calculus. If it does not soon pound Milosevic into political
submission, there will be few ethnic Albanians, maybe none, left in
Kosovo to protect.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the air campaign against the Serbs may have weakened
the security forces' infrastructure, but it has not achieved its
declared political goal of stopping the relentless campaign to push
the majority ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. Few military
commanders are openly confident that air power alone will quickly
achieve that aim.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign could take weeks or months, senior
administration officials warned. But Serbian security forces may
achieve their goal of driving ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo in as
little as 10 to 20 days, the NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The full horror of what has happened in Kosovo is still unknown,
a senior U.S. official said. There may be ``50 Srebrenicas,'' he
said, referring to the Bosnian town from which 7,000 Muslim men
fled in July 1995, only to be captured and then shot and buried by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The enormity of the campaign over Kosovo is felt across the
administration. One senior official involved in Kosovo policy said
Clinton made the ``most fateful decision of his presidency'' when
he decided in late March to go ahead with the air strikes without
considering using ground troops to stop the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, an official said there was ``anxiety across the
board'' about achieving Milosevic's capitulation, with military
officers asking basic questions, like ``Is this guy going to
yield?'' and ``Do we have the right strategy?''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said he had often wondered about when ``the big
one'' _ the foreign crisis that would threaten to spin out of
control _ might strike the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the big one,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the cruise-missile assault on Belgrade, Clinton met late
Friday with Vice President Al Gore and the tight circle known as
``the small group'' _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen; Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright; George Tenet, the director of central
intelligence; Sandy Berger, the national security adviser; and Gen.
Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The small
group reconvened Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday they discussed the military and political dimensions
of taking the war against Milosevic to the streets of his capital,
White House officials said. And they assessed the public pressure
for quick results from the continuing attack on Belgrade in days to
come, given the heart-rending images of terrified refugees fleeing
Kosovo, according to an official at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the mood at the Friday evening meeting with
Clinton was determined, if sometimes grim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Milosevic drives everyone out of Kosovo,'' he said.
``That doesn't stop the bombing. If in a week, 10 days, he's still
defiant, we'll take stock.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovo is purged of its 1.8 million ethnic Albanians, the air
campaign will continue to strike Serbian forces, hoping to push
them out of the province and eventually make way for some kind of
internationally recognized enclave guarded by NATO troops,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the room was saying, we're OK, we're on course,''
the official said. ``The weather has hampered us; the NATO
bureaucracy has hampered us. Now we're going to start to do real
damage. Let's not start looking at other options.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stay focused and turn up the pressure,'' he said.
``We're going to keep hitting Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   The political sensitivity of striking downtown Belgrade was so
strong that NATO commanders specifically sought Clinton's approval
for destroying the first targets, the Yugoslav federal Interior
Ministry and its counterpart for the republic of Serbia, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After sounding out his advisers with his customary concerns
about civilian casualties, Clinton gave a go-ahead to hit the first
targets and conduct expanded attacks in days to come, the officials
said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``He strongly believes we have to intensify the air campaign,
including the broadening of the target list to include the things
Milosevic values most,'' said a spokesman for the National Security
Council, David Leavy. ``The president has made it clear: We will go
after both troops in the field and the command and control centers
that go to the heart of Milosevic's power and his repression in
days to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent military history _ in Iraq and elsewhere _ provides
little basis for believing that smart bombs and cruise missiles
alone can convince a determined dictator to change course.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, three separate attacks on Baghdad _ first on its
intelligence headquarters and then on military targets _ did little
or nothing to undermine President Saddam Hussein. A twin assault on
Afghanistan and Sudan last year, aimed at what the administration
said were sites linked to the exiled Saudi terrorist Osama bin
Laden, created mostly disbelief among allies and defiance in the
Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Sudan, Clinton, concerned about killing
civilians, shied away from one likely military target to select a
factory that produced drugs for people and animals. The
administration has been unable to convince many allies that the
factory was tied to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Even if attacks on the fuel depots and command centers of
Milosevic's military force slow or stall his concerted attacks in
Kosovo, it is unclear that the notorious Serbian paramilitary
forces will be stopped by high-tech attacks from afar, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bombing campaign began, the ``ethnic cleansing'' of
Kosovo had just begun, and Clinton said the NATO attack aimed in
part ``to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent
civilians.'' But in his weekly radio address Saturday, the
president stopped short of predicting that air power alone would
stop the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' Clinton said, ``is to exact a very high price for
Milosevic's policy of repression and to seriously diminish his
military capacity to maintain that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton telephoned Prime Ministers Tony Blair of
Britain and Jacques Chirac of France to discuss the military and
humanitarian facts on the ground. Blair said Saturday that NATO's
attacks must ``continue until the whole policy of ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo is defeated'' and vowed that Milosevic would be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House situation room on Saturday morning, Cohen,
Albright, Shelton, Tenet and Berger reconvened to review the damage
done by the attack on downtown Belgrade and to discuss where and
when to strike again, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plans are unchanged: to bomb Milosevic to
the bargaining table.``What we're doing is thinking about the
political arrangements after he capitulates and accepts a
negotiated outcome,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   One outcome might be an ``international protectorate'' for
Kosovo under which the ethnic Albanians could return home under the
guard of NATO troops, he said. He did not say whether ethnic
Albanian leaders had been approached about such a solution. Nor is
it clear that thousands of NATO troops and millions of dollars in
Western aid would be sufficient to induce them to go back.

BRITAIN OUTLASTS U.S. TEAM IN DOUBLES TO AVOID ELIMINATION
</HEADLINE>

   BIRMINGHAM, England _ Tim and Greg. Greg and Tim. They are the
reason tennis is a year-round talking point again in Britain, and
the reason the capacity of the National Indoor Arena had to be
expanded twice to meet ticket demand for this first-round Davis Cup
match against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski played well enough
together to ensure that those ticket-holders won't have to watch
meaningless tennis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Their sweaty and lengthy 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 victory
over Todd Martin and Alex O'Brien narrowed the American lead to 2-1
in this rematch of the first Davis Cup tie in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans still need only one victory in Sunday's two
remaining singles matches to advance to the quarterfinals, while
the British need a sweep. In the first reverse singles match,
Henman will face Martin; in the second, Rusedski will face Jim
Courier.
</P>
<P>
   Courier, originally scheduled to play doubles with O'Brien,
rested instead after his 4-hour-12-minute, five-set singles victory
over Henman. For those who put stock in statistics, it is worth
noting that when Courier plays Davis Cup for his country, his
country is 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's so motivated, so positive in this setting,'' the
American captain Tom Gullikson said. ``He really feeds off the team
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and O'Brien started positively Saturday, winning the
first set after breaking Henman in the eighth game. They are a
complementary pairing: the 6-foot-6-inch Martin is forceful and one
of the game's better returners; the 6-1 O'Brien is quick around the
court and the net.
</P>
<P>
   But as the match wore on, Henman and Rusedski lifted their level
of play with the 9,400 spectators urging them on, and only some
inspired tennis from Martin and O'Brien kept the Britons from
closing out the match in the fourth-set tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth set, O'Brien saved three break points in the second
game on his serve but could not save the fourth. The Britons had a
2-0 lead, and they would not surrender it, closing out the match on
the left-handed Rusedski's serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a rough day for both of us,'' Henman said of the
Americans' two singles victories. ``But today's a bit different,
and now we're excited about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman and Rusedski, domestic rivals for public attention and
sponsorship contracts, have seldom played doubles together. But in
preparation for this event, they entered their first tournament
together in February in London and won the title.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and O'Brien are also infrequent partners. Their record
together before Saturday was 4-4. When he arrived in Birmingham,
Gullikson did not intend to use Martin in doubles because he was
still recovering from an abdominal strain and Gullikson wanted to
keep him fresh for singles. But after Martin dominated Rusedski on
Friday in straight sets by playing superbly, the American captain
changed his lineup this morning, replacing Courier with Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The result was Gullikson's 12th different doubles combination in
his 17 ties as captain, and though they produced some spectacular
tennis on occasion, the experiment was ultimately unsuccessful. &QL;

DIALLO-CASE FURY BARELY RESONATES AT GIULIANI EVENTS UPSTATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had not yet addressed the
700 business and political leaders squeezed into a college
gymnasium to eat filet mignon and hear his tips for transforming
troubled cities into centers of prosperity. But as the dinner rolls
were passed, Peter Goold was exuding enthusiasm about New York
City's graffiti-free subways and litter-free streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city seems to be not as harsh or dirty a place anymore,''
said Goold, who owns an apple orchard outside this industrial city
about 150 miles north of Manhattan. ``And Rudy Giuliani has
provided the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goold had little to say when the conversation turned to
Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African immigrant whose fatal
shooting by four white police officers has roiled that same city
for eight weeks and sparked intense criticism of Giuliani. ``People
up here aren't as close to it, so they're not as moved by it,'' he
explained. ``It just seems distant to us.''
</P>
<P>
   While elected officials, movie stars and hundreds of regular
citizens in New York City have assailed Giuliani's handling of the
Diallo case, the fury seems not to have spread to upstate New York,
where the Republican mayor recently began testing the waters for a
possible Senate race. Giuliani received standing ovations, fervent
praise and even a ``Citizen of the Year'' award during visits to
Ithaca, Syracuse and Troy last month, even as his approval ratings
back home fell precipitously and throngs of protesters accused him
of insensitivity to minority residents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews over the last few weeks, about three dozen
residents of four upstate cities _ including Republicans and
Democrats, avid followers of Giuliani and people who could barely
pronounce his name _ expressed sorrow about the shooting. But the
majority of people interviewed in those predominantly white
communities said they did not understand why the mayor has been
under attack since Diallo died in a hail of bullets on Feb. 4. Most
also defended Giuliani, applauding his crime-fighting tactics and
predicting that the Diallo incident would not hurt his chances in a
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there is an unfortunate incident, but you can't
blame Rudy,'' said Michael Verdile, a restaurant owner who came to
hear Giuliani speak last Tuesday at the Troy dinner, organized by
the Rensselaer County Regional Chamber of Commerce. ``With 40,000
police officers on his force, things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Sherman, a Troy bakery owner who did not attend the dinner
but said he had followed Giuliani's career, offered a similar view.
``He shouldn't be blamed for something the police did,'' Sherman
said. ``If you've got the police doing all this undercover stuff to
clean up the streets, some innocent people might get hurt by it.
But over all, it's going to do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani has not officially declared himself a
candidate for the Senate seat that Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a
Democrat, will relinquish when he retires next year, the Mayor has
behaved like one for months, aggressively raising money and giving
speeches around the nation. The prospect of Giuliani as a Senate
candidate has stirred considerable excitement upstate, where voters
are mostly Republican and eager for a strong candidate to make a
possible run against Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has also expressed
interest in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's Senate race between Alfonse M. D'Amato, the
Republican incumbent, and Charles E. Schumer was a strong reminder
of upstate residents' strong Republican leanings: although Schumer,
a Democrat, won the election, he carried only 6 of the 52 counties
north and west of the New York City metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   But while Giuliani has an advantage over a Democratic candidate
in upstate New York, most upstate residents interviewed said they
still knew little about him _ except that he had reduced crime. In
Schenectady, a city of 65,000 about 15 miles from Troy, Joan Grant
said all she knew about Giuliani was that ``the taxi drivers are
more friendly and the city is better-looking since he took over.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Diallo incident, Mrs. Grant said she knew from the
local television news that the actress Susan Sarandon had been
arrested while protesting the shooting. But Mrs. Grant, a volunteer
in a thrift shop, said she knew little else about the controversy
because, ``I don't want to hear news if it's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In his upstate appearances, Giuliani has talked mostly about his
strategies for reducing the city's crime rate and its welfare rolls
and for improving its economy _ strategies that he said could work
just as well in other parts of the state. But toward the end of his
speeches in Syracuse and Troy, he also offered a spirited defense
of the Police Department, saying that the police had used less
force in recent years and stressing that they deserved respect. At
both dinners, his comments on the police were met with hearty
applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in our little towns around here have a real respect for
what law enforcement goes through,'' said Neil J. Kelleher, the
Republican chairman of the Rensselaer County Legislature, who
attended the dinner in Troy. ``We tend to take things a little
slower than some of the downstate folks, and we are a little more
patient, and we are more willing to step back and allow an
investigation to take its natural course.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher was not the only person interviewed who suggested that
upstate residents had markedly different views of the Diallo
controversy than some city residents. John Stevens, a lawyer in
Ithaca who heard Giuliani speak at the Tompkins County Lincoln Day
Dinner on March 19, said it was not the shooting itself, but the
intense media coverage that followed, that had created the
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the view from here is that a lot of what goes on in
New York is a matter of screaming `Fire!''' he said. ``Every time
you turn around there is a new controversy, and it always has to
revolve around racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Several upstate residents said news of the protests that the
Rev. Al Sharpton led against Giuliani and the police had
intensified their support for the mayor, because they so strongly
disliked Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those protests will probably add five points to Rudy's
support,'' said William Troy, a lawyer who attended the Ithaca
dinner. ``Al Sharpton and his professional agitating represent
something just incomprehensible up here.''
</P>
<P>
   But while interviews suggested strong upstate support for
Giuliani and his response to the Diallo incident, they also
suggested that minority residents of upstate New York are wary of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Bradford, a black resident of Schenectady, said the case
confirmed his longstanding suspicion that Giuliani was racially
insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking a second look at Giuliani after Diallo,''
said Bradford, a gas station attendant and part-time student. ``But
not up here. Upstate is out of touch with New York City, and it's
too bad, because this kind of problem is like cancer. If you don't
cut it down down there, it's going to spread up here.''

STEINBRENNER'S KISS: IRABU GOES FROM FROG TO PRINCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif.)   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hideki Irabu was expected to rejoin the Yankees
Saturday, in the team's latest installment of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher, who was called a fat toad by the Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner after failing to cover first base in an
exhibition game on Thursday, was initially told to remain at the
team's Florida training complex, and that he would rejoin the team
Tuesday in Oakland, Calif., for the Yankees' regular-season opening
series. Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, said Ramiro
Mendoza would pitch Wednesday in a day game against the Athletics,
calling it his decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinbrenner _ who has taken on a fatherly mien as this
series of events has unfolded _ told The Associated Press in Tampa,
Fla., Saturday that ``it would be my hope'' that Irabu would start
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner also said Irabu's role ``will be determined'' by
the manager, but his stated desire that Irabu will start places
Zimmer in an uncomfortable position. Some of Irabu's teammates are
fed up with what they perceive as preferential treatment for the
hard-throwing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   If Zimmer starts Mendoza, as he said Friday he intends to do,
then he will be contravening the wishes of the owner. On the other
hand, if he starts Irabu, Zimmer will appear powerless in the eyes
of those disgusted players.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, in recent years, has been as active as always in
the formulation of the team.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the owner made the decision last November to sign
Bernie Williams, once it appeared Albert Belle would sign with
Baltimore and Williams could be headed to the rival Boston Red Sox.
It was Steinbrenner's decision to keep Orlando Hernandez in the
pitching rotation last June and move Mendoza to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, however, has allowed Manager Joe Torre great
flexibility in determining how he would use players, and except in
rare instances, the owner's involvement in day-to-day decisions has
been kept out of public view. But as Torre recovers from
prostate-cancer surgery and Zimmer tries to establish himself,
Steinbrenner is in the forefront of the team's handling of Irabu _
perhaps because he feels the right-hander is hampered by a lack of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``His teammates are anxious to have him back,'' Steinbrenner
said. ``He will do fine. It's a good day for the Yankees. We wanted
Hideki to know we are all behind him. I'm glad he spent the two
days here.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu worked out for 18 minutes in a bullpen early Saturday with
Billy Connors, the director of player personnel, while Steinbrenner
met with Irabu's agent, Don Nomura. Irabu did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens will pitch the regular-season opener for the
Yankees on Monday night, with Hernandez going on Tuesday night. For
now, Mendoza is scheduled to pitch Wednesday afternoon, but this
appears to be a fluid situation.

 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Past rows of vacant rooms, at the end of a corridor
deep in the dust of demolition and renovation, a handwritten sign
taped to the door of No. 701 is like a muffled cry: ``Occupied.
Please do not touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Here lives Suzanne Remy, one of the last residents of the
Allerton Hotel for Women. In her time, Mademoiselle Remy created
hats for Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. She sold $17,000 gowns
at Bergdorf Goodman on commission. When the Germans occupied her
native Paris 59 years ago, she worked the switchboard at the
American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though her tenancy is protected by law, just staying put,
she said, seems like an act of defiance. In her 8-by-10-foot room,
with a broken faucet and a hot plate, Ms. Remy is part of a
dwindling band of 48 residents who have withstood a campaign to
drive them from the Allerton, a faded grande dame of single room
occupancy at East 57th Street and Lexington Avenue that its owners
hope to convert into a luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Like the better-known Barbizon, the 448-room Allerton opened in
the 1920s as a genteel residential hotel for young ladies of good
breeding and professional aspiration. As recently as the 1960s, it
still had a marble staircase, grand pianos in the lobby, and
white-gloved elevator maids who enforced the cardinal rule: no men
above the third floor. But decades of neglect took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   Today the hotel is hard-fought terrain in New York City's real
estate wars. Tourist demand and a booming economy are driving the
biggest surge of SRO conversions since the early 1980s. For tenant
advocates and landlords alike, the Allerton is a new testing ground
for 15-year-old local laws that try to restrict the redevelopment
of single room occupancies in an effort to stem homelessness and
protect longtime residents from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, the Allerton's management waged an
illegal campaign of lockouts and verbal abuse to oust tenants, most
of them elderly or frail, from rent-regulated rooms, an
administrative hearing officer for the city's Department of Housing
Preservation and Development concluded late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotel employees shouting at tenants, cursing at tenants,
referring to them as losers or crazy, screaming at tenants about
rent in the street, following a tenant into a diner daily for
several weeks and asking her about moving out, and threatening
placement in a nursing home if tenants did not go away are examples
of harassment,'' the hearing officer, Frances Lippa, wrote in a
decision rendered December 31, after hearing testimony over a
13-month period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where could I go?'' asked Ms. Remy, a tiny woman with a black
organdy bow in upswept hair, perched on a floral bedspread piled
with doctor bills and medicine for asthma, emphysema and glaucoma.
Still chic after all these years (exactly how many, she would not
say), she gave a small shrug at the water-damaged ceiling and
mottled walls of the room where she has lived since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   She pays $153 a week, much more than the $3.27-a-day charged for
the room where the longest permanent resident, a former model, has
lived for five decades, but low compared to the alternatives.
Studios in the neighborhood start at $1,195 a month, and at the
Allerton, recently renamed the Habitat Hotel, modestly renovated
rooms without private bath or toilet cost tourists $75 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Property Markets Group, a real estate investment
company that took control of the hotel in 1997, say that whatever
harassment the tenants endured under the previous management has
nothing to do with them. Ongoing renovations, including a new
lobby, new pipes and electrical rewiring, represent major
improvements in exchange for minor inconveniences, they say, not a
form of harassment, as some tenants have charged.
</P>
<P>
   The company pressed city housing officials to overrule the
hearing officer and grant the hotel a ``certificate of
no-harassment,'' which is legally required before vacant rooms in
an SRO can be reconfigured into the upscale suites of a more
lucrative tourist-class hotel. But last month, after most tenants
refused to go along, the city denied the application. The hotel
management must now wait three years before it can reapply and then
must show that tenants were not harassed during that period. For
now, only renovations that do not change the number of units are
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that justice was served,'' said Franklin R.
Kaiman, the lawyer who opposed the city's harassment case against
the hotel, on behalf of the hotel's longtime owner, Allan Goldman,
and for Property Markets Group, which has agreed to lease the hotel
from Goldman for 49 years at $2.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the incidents cited by the hearing officer occurred when
Goldman controlled the hotel and employed a manager to run it.
Goldman said in an interview that he was unaware of any harassment,
but the hearing officer concluded that it was conducted on his
behalf, and that pressure to force tenants out continued to some
degree after Property Markets Group took over. Technically Goldman
still owns the hotel, but all business decisions, and profits or
losses, fall to Property Markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company, owned by Kevin P. Maloney, a former banker, and
Ziel Feldman, a real estate lawyer, controls about 75
rent-regulated buildings in Manhattan, including two other SRO's
where luxury hotel conversions are planned and one SRO where
conversion is underway even as tenants have filed harassment
complaints and a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Around a conference table on the fifth floor of the former
Allerton, the thump and whine of construction in the background,
Kaiman and his frustrated clients said it was not rational for
tenants to reject offers of settlement that had included better
rooms, private bathrooms, and in a few cases, up to $15,000, all
contingent on enough tenant support for the conversion to win city
approval. Since that never happened, they said, tenants who wanted
a deal lost out.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiman contended that tenants who rejected the offers were
manipulated by MFY Legal Services, a city-financed nonprofit agency
that provides representation for SRO tenants.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for MFY counter that tenants made up their own
minds, and with good reasons. Amy J. Mayer, who has handled the
case since the hearing, said the company's tactics and track record
alienated most of the tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really strong group of women,'' she said. ``They
stood up for themselves in a very brave way.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Last year, developers filed 99 applications for certificates of
no-harassment affecting 2,331 SRO units in Manhattan, more than a
fourfold increase since 1993, according to an analysis of city
figures by the West Side SRO project. The Allerton application was
one of only three denied since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The women of the Allerton seem unlikely combatants. Some, like
the red-haired secretary who retired from NASA soon after Neil
Armstrong walked on the Moon, say they are too fearful of
management retaliation to let a newspaper print their names.
Others, like the woman who worked for a New Deal think tank in the
1930s, are too proud to draw attention to their reduced
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But Mehru Ramnagar, a 74-year-old retired nurse who has been a
mainstay of the revolt, said softly, ``Just because they are old,
it doesn't mean that they are nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel declined rapidly in the 1980s, when many of its rooms
were ``warehoused,'' or deliberately kept vacant, according to city
findings. Tenants testified that verbal abuse began in 1993, when
Goldman hired Gary Greene as the hotel's manager. Greene, the
tenants said, told people he had been hired to clear out the place.
Greene denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the harassment hearing began late in 1997, there
were fewer than 60 residents and Property Markets Group had taken
charge.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, men, some of them Marymount Manhattan College
students, were lodged on floors where only women had lived before.
The students soon left and sued, contending their rooms were
uninhabitable. Then workers ripped out communal bathrooms and
toilets floor by floor, and tore up the hallways, making them
treacherous to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Some floors were left like that for months, and heat, hot water,
electricity, telephone and elevator service were repeatedly
disrupted, tenants and their lawyers said. The hotel management
said the disruptions were minimal considering the scale of needed
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   City records show that the hotel was fined at least five times
by city agencies last year for creating a fire hazard, working
without permits and not supplying heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not targeting elderly women to recapture rooms _ that's
totally ridiculous,'' responded Ron Simoncini, whose public
relations company represents Property Markets Group. ``The
suggestion that we've done anything but what we're supposed to do
here insults us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, before the harassment hearing concluded, Kaiman, the
lawyer for the hotel's owners, sent a letter offering each of the
seven tenants who had testified $15,000 and a renovated room with
private bath if all would recant their testimony, and an extra
$10,000 each if they moved out. The five remaining tenants refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dirty money,'' said one tenant witness, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, saying she did not want old friends to know
how she lives now. She testified that desk clerks ridiculed her use
of a walker and called her a loser.
</P>
<P>
   When the hearing officer's decision went against the hotel, a
new flurry of settlement offers appeared under tenant doors: They
would be moved away from construction and provided private
bathrooms with no rent increase for life if they agreed to the
conversion and the city approved it despite the harassment finding.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 11 of the 48 tenants showed interest in the deal,
according to documents supplied by both sides. One wrote the city
that as a past victim of rape, she was tormented by having to share
a bathroom with strange men and wanted the private bathroom offered
in the deal. ``Yes, construction is noisy and messy, but it is also
temporary,'' she said, in a letter supplied by Kaiman, ``and when
it is completed, our standard of living will have soared.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the tenants felt bullied and insulted, Ms. Mayer
said, and dreaded more construction. Some already considered
modernization a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the light over my bed,'' one lamented. ``They said I
could have a fax.''
</P>
<P>
   The divide between the real estate men and their tenants runs
deep. Maloney, a 40-year-old native of Casper, Wyo., cited Internet
capability and durable pipes as improvements worth the disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from now, 90 percent of the people will say it's so
much better here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Remy does not expect to live that long. ``I'm being very
strong about it,'' she said, with a wave of her hand that released
a faint whiff of Chanel No. 5. ``But believe me, at night I have my
weak moments.''

<P>
   The scout was a careful man, never given to hyperbole,
distinguished and respected, with a courtly manner that earned him
the nickname of the Prince in his days as a pitcher. He watched
17-year-old Derek Jeter play baseball in the summer of 1991 in
Kalamazoo, Mich., tracking him into the spring of 1992. He liked
Jeter's arm and lean frame and his speed, but the scout looked for
more.
</P>
<P>
   In his eighth decade, the scout wrote out his reports, his
handwriting and his choice of words precise; there was no doubt how
this scout felt about any player, his supervisor would say years
later. You read his reports and the scout either liked a player or
he didn't. There was no hedging.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's skills were impressive and he radiated joy when he
played, the scout thought. Intrigued, he did what all good scouts
do: he started asking around, a private investigator with a
stopwatch and a radar gun. What kind of kid is Derek? Do his
teammates like him? Is his ego out of control? Is he a good
student? Does he want to go to college? What's his family like?
</P>
<P>
   The scout would learn a lot about Derek Jeter. Good things.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Jeter is set to begin his fourth year as the
Yankees' everyday shortstop. They open the 1999 season in Oakland
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ask around Kalamazoo, and everybody seems to have only good
things to say about Derek Jeter and his family. Derek was the type
of kid, Evelyn Lal said, ``that you wanted your kid to be friends
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanti Lal, her son, befriended Derek in the fourth grade, in
Mrs. Garzelloni's class at St. Augustine Cathedral School in
Kalamazoo. ``Derek was one of those kids you just never forget, and
I would say that even if he wasn't playing baseball,'' said Shirley
Garzelloni, who retired last year. ``He was the kind of student any
teacher would want to have. I was just struck with how much he
cared about his fellow classmates.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared a little shy and quiet, she thought, but had a
composed confidence, even as a boy. He got along with everybody and
succeeded without needing to be prodded or praised. ``He was
completely self-motivated, creative, never wasted any time,''
Garzelloni recalled. ``There are kids who will say to you, `I don't
have anything to do' _ not with Derek. He always found something to
do. I remember doing a report card and thinking, `Does he realize
just how intelligent he is?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As smart as he was, Garzelloni said, Jeter never carried himself
as if he were any different from his classmates. Evelyn Lal said,
``He's quiet, but at the same time, he's very smart _ he knows how
to fit in, to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   He was comfortable around different types of people and, his
father suggested, that made sense. Charles Jeter is black and from
Alabama and Dorothy Jeter is white and from New Jersey, and Derek
seemed at ease with kids from all kinds of backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   There were the trials of youth: Charles Jeter remembered that
once when Derek was perhaps 10 or 11, a teacher told them that
Derek had said something cruel to a classmate. His parents
chastised Derek, told him this was unacceptable. You treat people
the way you want to be treated, they said, and Derek thought about
this quietly, absorbing and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty much head and shoulders above his
contemporaries, but he never came across as being arrogant,'' said
Chris Oosterban _ Jeter stills calls her ``Mrs. O'' _ who taught
writing and history to Jeter at St. Augustine when he was in the
seventh and eighth grade. ``He didn't paint a glowing picture of
himself, and he didn't have this `I'm really cool' attitude. He was
very genuine and humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter worked as a tutor in a computer laboratory in his last two
years of high school at Kalamazoo Central, and Sally Padley, who
taught Jeter in British literature, thought he conducted himself
perfectly. ``He just had an easy manner, no signs of conceit, and
when he was helping people, he didn't make any of them feel less
important,'' said Padley.
</P>
<P>
   She taught him in the last hour of school, a time when some
student-athletes departed to prepare for games. ``He absolutely
never asked for any special consideration,'' Padley recalled. ``He
never asked out of class, never bragged about his baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball was significant to him. His favorite team, Derek
told his fourth-grade teacher, was the New York Yankees, and he
wrote an essay in the eighth grade of his desire to play shortstop
for the Yankees. Padley asked her 11th-grade students to create a
coat of arms, unique to each of them and their personalities. In
one corner of Jeter's rendering, he included a picture of himself
wearing a Yankees uniform. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scout, careful and understated as he was, wrote an
assessment of Jeter: He's a special player and he's a special kid,
and this caught the attention of his supervisor, who had never read
words like this from the scout. Derek Jeter, the scout told his
supervisor, is going to be the anchor and the foundation of a
winning club.
</P>
<P>
   There was a meeting of all the team's scouts just before the
draft in 1992, and they discussed the available players. In these
meetings, they talk about skills, they analyze how good a prospect
is today and how his abilities will evolve over time. With high
school seniors _ like Jeter in 1992 _ they talk about whether the
prep star intends to play college baseball and how large a signing
bonus he wants. The names of prospective draftees are listed on
giant boards, the stock of some going up while others move down the
board.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted a college player with speed, there was Jeffrey
Hammonds, the outfielder from Stanford. Cal State-Fullerton's Phil
Nevin could become a great hitter, they agreed, the type of player
who might ascend quickly to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The distinguished scout from Michigan spoke of Jeter, of his
skills and his personality, and said it might require $1 million to
sign him _ a staggering bonus for that time. ``No one is worth $1
million,'' said the 74-year-old scout, who pitched for a few
thousand dollars a year in his day. ``But if one kid is worth that,
it's this kid.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To reinforce their reports on Jeter, this scout and others
mentioned his parents: a great kid with great parents. Dorothy and
Charles Jeter were always involved, Derek's former teachers say,
always at the teacher-parent conferences, supportive of their
suggestions, interested in their input. Derek Jeter called his
11th-grade teacher ``Mrs. Padley,'' and so, too, did his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have extremely strong values,'' said Padley. ``They are
some of the best parents I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jeter was raised in a single-parent home, with a mother
who encouraged him and expected him to be accountable for the way
he treated others; Dorothy Jeter's parents supported her endeavors,
as well, and together, the Jeters believed in encouraging their two
children. When Derek said he wanted to be the shortstop for the
Yankees, they told him that with hard work, anything was possible,
and sometimes the four of them would go in their backyard to
practice _ Charles hitting ground balls, Derek fielding and
throwing the ball to his younger sister, Sharlee, perhaps Dorothy
pitching Wiffleball.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of each school year, Charles and Dorothy Jeter
sat down with a yellow legal pad and drew up a contract with Derek.
They agreed to terms on grades, on sports, on extracurricular
activities, on how to handle drugs, and the parents and their son
would sign together.
</P>
<P>
   Ace Adams, formerly the assistant baseball coach at the
University of Michigan, said the Jeters were the best parents of
any recruit he ever dealt with. Adams recalled how, after the
Yankees drafted Derek, the teen-ager informed him daily of the
progress of his contract negotiations, so that the Wolverines would
be prepared to replace Jeter if he signed.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent to Adams that Derek Jeter was going to be a
star, yet he and his parents never took Adams or the school for
granted. Dorothy Jeter once asked Adams, ``Are you sure Derek is
good enough to play here?'' Adams replied, ``Mrs. Jeter, he
could've started here when he was in the eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Padley, Oosterban and Garzelloni all spoke of their belief that
no matter how big a celebrity Jeter became, no matter how much
money he made, he would be rooted. ``Derek has a lot of things he's
going to learn about people, and being in the eye of the public,''
said Padley. ``But I believe he's going to remain a very decent
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter could never change _ never let the success go to his head
_ and get away with it, he said recently. ``I couldn't go home. I'm
no different than anybody else,'' Jeter said, except that he has a
pretty good job.
</P>
<P>
   He's still Derek from Kalamazoo, with the same friends from high
school, friends who are scattered around the country now. Doug
Biro, a friend from the fourth grade, stopped by the other day to
have dinner with him in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Shanti Lal, his friend from Mrs. Garzelloni's class, visited him
in the minor leagues in Columbus, Ohio, and in spring training two
years ago. They grew up together, laughed together; Derek and
Shanti and another friend had entered a talent contest, the three
of them, as the Jackson 5, with wigs and blue suits.
</P>
<P>
   Lal planned to go to medical school, but on May 4, 1997, his
sport utility vehicle rolled over on Interstate 94, and he was
thrown from it and killed. Dorothy Jeter was the first to arrive at
Evelyn Lal's house. Derek heard the news, and later, past midnight,
he called home and spoke to his father. ``I can't believe it,'' he
said. ``Shanti's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a baseball season, Jeter could not attend his
friend's service, but he wrote a letter, and his sister read the
words aloud, about his friendship with Shanti, how long they had
known each other, all their shared experiences, their last days in
Tampa together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek, he's a very good kid,'' Evelyn Lal said last week. ``He
is the type of kid I want my kids to be with, my Shanti.''
</P>
<P>
   The scout, who worked for the Houston Astros, got a phone call
from his supervisor, Dan O'Brien, just before the '92 draft.
O'Brien, then the scouting director for Houston, called to say the
Astros planned to select Nevin with the first overall pick. ``It's
an organizational decision,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The scout _ Hal Newhouser _ was ``extremely disappointed,''
O'Brien recalled. Newhouser implored club officials to reconsider
their decision. But the Astros drafted Nevin; Jeter fell into the
hands of the Yankees, who had the sixth pick in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouser began his baseball career in 1939 with the Detroit
Tigers, at age 18, won 207 games and two Most Valuable Player
awards and was inducted into the Hall of Fame, and in more than 50
years in the game, he had distinct tastes. He did not like Albert
Belle, he decided. ``I don't like his manners,'' he said once. ``I
don't like his attitude. As far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't pay to
see him play.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked Derek Jeter, everything about him. After the Astros
picked Nevin instead of Jeter, Newhouser _ nearing retirement,
anyway _ quit baseball in disgust. He died at age 78 last fall, a
month after Jeter anchored the infield of history's most successful
team, the foundation of two championships in his first three years
in the majors.

   KUKES, Albania _ The stark evidence of the failure of NATO air
raids to prevent Serbian forces from driving hundreds of thousands
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo is in the haunted eyes of almost
300,000 who have already been driven out, and in their unconfirmed,
but uniform tales of horror.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer enormity of the Serbian drive recalls both the spring
and the summer of 1992 in Bosnia, when an estimated 750,000
Bosnians were driven from their homes, and Balkan wars stretching
back to the 1870s. In this region of Europe, making policy by
shifting populations has a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia seem to
be keeping to that tradition, stripping Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
of the farms and houses that are their only source of wealth, and
then reportedly taking identity documents, property deeds and car
license plates _ everything that would prove they had lived in the
southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The shattered refugees who have crossed the border here for the
past nine days have told of Serbian forces rampaging through the
countryside looting, pillaging, burning and killing at will and,
finally, hounding the Albanians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a calculated program of ``massive ethnic cleansing,'' a
NATO spokesman, Sir David Wilby, said at a briefing in Brussels,
Belgium, on Saturday, ``manufactured in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO says this forced exodus from Kosovo is rapidly turning into
the biggest population movement in Europe since World War II. A
NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, estimated on Saturday that Kosovo could
be cleared of its entire ethnic Albanian population in 10 to 20
days if the current pace at which refugees are arriving keeps up.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more refugees poured over the border here on Friday
night in the rain, spending the night on windswept hillsides with
no shelter other than plastic sheets over their farm carts. This
little town in northern Albania has been swamped with refugees, its
cracked streets filled and what little infrastructure there is
overwhelmed. Water supplies shut off and in the grimy hospital on
the edge of town doctors were pulling shrapnel from refugee
patients without anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   In the long, dejected lines of refugees, people tell almost
identical stories _ differing only in time and place _ of the
arrival of armed men, from the special Interior Ministry police,
the Yugoslav army, or private, ultranationalist paramilitary
militias like the ``Tigers,'' run by the warlord Zeljko
Raznjatovic, better known as Arkan.
</P>
<P>
   Straggling over the border in the last two days have been clumps
of people _ almost all women, children and a few old men _ from the
region around Malisevo who say they have been on the run for days,
hiding in the mountains and woods and under shellfire from tanks,
mortars and Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kind of widely dispersed, small-unit tactics that
could only be countered by opposing ground troops. To date,
President Clinton and other NATO leaders have said they would not
send ground troops into Kosovo to fight, although NATO planners and
senior administration officials have suggested that allied forces
may go into the province to create what they term a protectorate _
essentially a guarded enclave to which Kosovo's Albanians could
return, under NATO protection.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Serbian strategy of driving the ethnic Albanians out without
documents not only makes it difficult for them to prove that they
ever lived there, but also for them to be integrated into the more
regulated societies of other European countries, if they cannot or
will not eventually return home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they have no money. This is a part of the world
where accumulated wealth is traditionally not kept in banks or
other investments, but is put primarily into building and improving
one's home and furnishing it with material possessions. Thus, by
burning the houses, the Serbs are wiping out everything the ethnic
Albanians have accumulated over generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years of work, from the father to the son, and now
everything is gone,'' said Osman Osman, 44.
</P>
<P>
   If the hometowns and villages _ mostly now burned _ of the
arriving refugees are traced on a map, a clear pattern emerges of
the population being systematically swept from whole regions.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, the first refugees were mainly from around the
nearest city of Prizren, which lies on a main highway running
through the border, and then from around Dakovica, on a secondary
road to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Next, people from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, arrived,
saying that they were pulled from their homes, marched between
lines of masked gunmen, held overnight in a railroad station and
then bused en masse to the border.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees arriving now, villagers, are from more
outlying areas like Dragas, a pocket to the southeast, or around
Malisevo to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The first refugees had several hours or overnight to gather a
few belongings. For the past several days, the refugees have been
carrying only a blanket or a few clothes in a plastic bag. Many are
on foot and have not had food or water for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers at the border say that they are now seeing more sick
and wounded people, partly because they have been on the road
longer and are suffering from exposure and exhaustion, or are
coming from areas that have been under shellfire.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Speaking from inside Kosovo, a top commander
of the rebel army Saturday described what he called massacres of
civilians in parts of the province and continuing attacks by
Yugoslav air force jets, tanks and artillery against villages
despite 10 days of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, a member of the General Staff of the Kosovo
Liberation Army who goes by the name Drini, also asked for the
first time for emergency air drops of food from outside countries
to ease what he called a ``terrible'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   The commander's account, in a telephone interview, could not be
independently confirmed. He is a figure well known to foreign
journalists and verifiers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and has proven a reliable source of
information in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Since foreign journalists were expelled from Kosovo last week,
precise information has been difficult to obtain on possible
atrocities in the province and the level of resistance being
offered by a desperately outgunned rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday Drini said that he and his men were persevering in
their fight against Serbian forces and trying to protect civilians,
who are fleeing the province by the hundreds of thousands. He
repeated an impassioned appeal by the guerrillas for supplies of
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing tactical maneuvers to try and save the population
from the Serb army,'' he said. ``But where we are using a unit of
50 to 60 men, they are up against a whole division, with tanks,
artillery and infantry.''
</P>
<P>
   If the outside world gave military support, he added, ``we could
do much more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav forces are still bombing villages with MiG fighter
jets, Drini said, and using tanks and heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   He said bad weather had prevented NATO bombers working with full
effectiveness. ``Even God turned its back on the Albanians,'' he
said. ``For 12 days there have been no clear skies, and we have not
had airstrikes'' in his area of central Kosovo, though he would not
disclose where he was speaking from exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and its NATO allies have acknowledged that the
weather has seriously hampered attacks by high-flying allied jets,
although they have given few specifics about their actions over and
in Kosovo. No outside power has said it is ready to arm or supply
the rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   Drini said that his forces were now fighting on several fronts
around Kosovo and coming under heavy pressure as ammunition and
food were running low.
</P>
<P>
   Supply lines from Albania have been cut, the rebel army said
earlier in the week. The rebels said the food situation was so
desperate that they were having to use their own rations to feed
the thousands of displaced civilians inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian situation is terrible,'' he said. ``People
are under the open skies and it is now raining. There is a lack of
food and we are giving out our reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Drini, who said he was wounded this week, related what he said
were three separate incidents of mass killings of civilians by
Serbian forces in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   He said 150 people, including women and children, had been found
killed in Izbica, in northern Drenica region, northeast of the
Kosovo capital, Pristina. Another 70 had been killed in the village
of Pusto Selo, and another 34 people in Jovic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the incidents could be confirmed independently.
</P>
<P>
   The commander also said that Yugoslav MiG-29s hit a school
Friday in a heavily contested area of northern Kosovo. ``There were
200 people there,'' he said ``but fortunately casualties were low.
Only 3 people were killed and 27 wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees crossing the border into Albania on Saturday said that
one target of the Serbian MiGs two nights ago was the village of
Negovac, where Albanians from a half-dozen smaller hamlets had
gathered for safety, according to several overlapping accounts
given to foreign journalists and relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 2 o'clock in the morning,'' said Rahman Helshawi, 44.
``They bombed from airplanes twice and the village was destroyed.
There are many, many people dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Drini said that while NATO bombing was succeeding in cutting
Serbian military supply routes and would inevitably demoralize the
military, ground troops are the only answer now to contain the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is exhausting the big war machine of the Serbs,'' he
said. ``But air power never solves the problem. We see NATO ground
forces as the only way to solve the problem in Kosovo,'' he said.
``NATO knows that, and if they can help us with military materiel
and supplies, we will be able to make enough trouble for a month
until they can come in.''

<P>
</P>
<P>
   His call for assistance is not the first from the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and the message is now reaching Western
governments, diplomats and foreign military observers here said.
</P>
<P>
   Drini, 38, who has 20 years of military schooling and experience
in the former Yugoslav People's Army, is emerging as one of the
guerrilla army's top military men. Until recently commander of one
of the six zones in Kosovo, he was promoted two weeks ago to the
General Staff of the rebel army, which seeks independence for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He and others with solid military experience have been credited
over the last year with transforming the KLA from the ragtag
peasant force into a well-coordinated fighting force. Better
trained and equipped than before, the guerrillas have engaged in
serious fighting in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   It fought off the Serbian military in a battle in northern
Kosovo in December and in recent fighting has managed to inflict
some damage and casualties on attacking forces. Yet it remains
vastly outgunned. NATO shot down one MiG-29 jet Thursday, he said,
but the Serbian air force still had five more jets in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Drini also passionately pressed an urgent request issued earlier
this week by the chief of staff of the guerrilla army for countries
to provide food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is burning all around us,'' Drini said. ``There are
convoys of people stuck, trying to flee to Albania and Macedonia.
They are fleeing for their lives. I cannot describe to you the
state they are in. They are like zombies.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, European observers and diplomatic staff have been at the
border region in Macedonia this week to assess the refugee
situation and report back to their respective organizations and
governments.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the American ambassador at large for War Crimes
Issues, spent hours over the last two days interviewing refugees at
the vast camp developing in the Macedonian town of Blace, just
south of the border with Kosovo. He said he would be returning to
the United States to report to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has steered clear of showing support for the
rebel army as a military organization, and administration officials
pushed the rebels during peace talks in France to transform
themselves into a political movement.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO said Saturday that it was planning to
send a force of 6,000 to 8,000 troops to Albania to provide
security and emergency relief for the masses of Kosovo Albanians
who have been driven from neighboring Yugoslavia by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is mobilizing all its available resources for this urgent
humanitarian requirement,'' the alliance's spokesman, Jamie P.
Shea, said. He announced that allied ambassadors had asked the top
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, for a plan to
deploy an operational headquarters, helicopters, troops and
supplies to Albania as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also said that Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain,
commanding a force of more than 10,000 British, French and German
troops in Macedonia that was originally intended for a peacekeeping
mission in Kosovo, was ordered to put all of them to work helping
Macedonia deal with the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Macedonia, saying it was overwhelmed by the flow of
people into the country, announced that it would close its border.
Defense Ministry officials in London said 200,000 Kosovo Albanians
are currently making their way toward Macedonia on the road from
Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 165,000 refugees have already arrived in Albania from
Kosovo since the allies began bombing to try to stop the Serbian
campaign, according to allied officials. Shea said that 55,000
people crossed into Albania Friday alone, and that 290,000 Kosovo
Albanians had fled into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro in the
last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate,'' Shea said Saturday, ``if you do a mathematical
calculation, Serb forces will have emptied Kosovo of its entire
population in 10 to 20 days.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that despite the missile attacks that blew
up the Yugoslav and Serbian Interior Ministries headquarters in
Belgrade shortly after midnight, bad weather overnight kept large
numbers of allied planes from going after the Serb forces driving
people from Kosovo. Those operations would continue once the
weather cleared, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea and others here deny that the air campaign targeted the
Yugoslav president, Slodoban Milosevic, who has shown no signs of
relenting in his campaign against the 1.8 million ethnic Albanians
who once lived in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the business that we're into,'' said the British
air commodore, David Wilby, the allied military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Saturday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain issued
some of the strongest statements yet by an allied leader against
the Yugoslav leader, ``Your policy of ethnic cleansing is an act of
barbarity,'' he said in a message broadcast on Sky Television. ``We
will defeat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark charged Saturday that the flood of refugees was part of a
deliberate strategy by Milosevic to destabilize the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a calculated, deliberate, arranged, pre-planned
humanitarian catastrophe,'' he told a small group reporters at the
alliance's military headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It serves two purposes,'' Clark added. ``Not only does it
change the demographics in Kosovo, but it helps to destabilize
Macedonia. So it is part of his ongoing strategy to cause
difficulty for that democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
   To help the refugees, NATO erected 3,500 tents Saturday and
plans to ship another 5,000 tents over the next 24 hours, Western
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials here said they believed that the Serbian
campaign was aimed at emptying a large triangle of territory in
Kosovo, roughly a triangle between Pristina and the cities of Pec
and Prizren, of its ethnic Albanian inhabitants and replacing them
with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen some reports of Serbian refugees from the Krajina
entering Kosovo,'' said Edgar Buckley, a British official,
referring to a region of Croatia that was largely emptied of Serbs
in fighting in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With clouds and rain keeping most of the 450-odd allied planes
from hitting the Serbian military and police forces enough to keep
them from driving more refugees out, the allies are now being
forced to deal with the humanitarian disaster spreading into
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who met with the
Albanian president and prime minister Saturday in Tirana, canceled
a stopover in Rome to fly to Skopje, Macedonia. The Macedonians
said they decided to close the border out of concern that the
massive influx of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could upset the
ethnic balance of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their concerns are absolutely legitimate and understandable,''
Talbott said, after meeting with Kosovo refugees in a tent city of
2,000 in Tirana. ``We are seeing with our own eyes today a policy
on the part of Yugoslavia to undercut the viability of neighboring
states.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott's delegation also sped to Macedonia with the aim of
pressuring its leaders to open up the borders again and let the
refugees in, another American official said.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has absorbed 55,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The allies say they have observed about 25,000 people backed up
inside Kosovo behind the border crossing point waiting for the Serb
authorities to let them pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let you down,'' Blair told the refugees in his
British television interview Saturday. ``We will make sure that you
are able to return to your homes, and live in your homes in
peace,'' he said. ``That is our promise to you and we will carry it
out.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Shea said that Jackson had already asked for 1 million food
rations, 50,000 gallons of drinking water, and 187,000 blankets and
was setting up a feeding station near the border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Three American soldiers on a border patrol fell into Serbian
hands earlier in the week and were taken prisoner. A Western
official said Saturday that there was evidence the three American
soldiers now being detained in Yugoslavia were kidnapped by
Yugoslav special forces who crossed into Macedonia and took the
Americans out.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have also expressed concern about the situation in
Montenegro, which is federated with Serbia within Yugoslavia.
Milosevic replaced eight Yugoslav military commanders in Montenegro
this week, allied officials said, and could be preparing a coup
there.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to destabilize the government of Montenegro ``could
have more serious consequences,'' Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
of France said in Paris Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which fears an uncontrolled influx of refugees across the
Adriatic, asked its allies on Friday to create a force to ensure
the safety of the refugees in Albania. Italy has offered to lead
the force and provide most of the soldiers for it, according to an
Italian official here.
</P>
<P>
   American, British and French warplanes continued to launch
attacks from bases in Italy Saturday, officials said, in an effort
to stop the Serb persecution and stem the refugee flow.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the allies met here to discuss other emergency steps to
deal with the victims of the violence in Kosovo, British and NATO
officers said that the American and British cruise missiles
launched from ships at targets in central Belgrade in the predawn
hours Saturday morning had caused no significant damage to civilian
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile attacks destroyed the Serbian and Yugoslav
Interior Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Air Marshal John Day, chief of the British defense staff in
London, described these headquarters as ``the nerve center of
operations planned to drive out ethnic Albanians in a campaign of
violence, intimidation and thuggery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's attacks will continue and can be intensified even
further if necessary,'' he said. ``The weather is forecast to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only need a couple of days of good weather to be able to
have a maximized effect,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said allied planes had managed Friday to hit staging areas
used by the Yugoslav 547th Mechanized Brigade for attacks against
civilians, but he did not say how much damage the planes did.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were in three areas along the road between Prizren
and Djakovica in southwestern Kosovo.

REAL ESTATE: MAKING TENEMENTS MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN S. OSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's a tenement?'' asked Daniel Khodadadian, a
28-year-old physician doing his residency at Lenox Hill Hospital,
as he stood, keys in hand, ready to enter his own renovated
tenement building at 167 East 77th St. a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khodadadian and his parents arrived in the United States
from Iran via Israel only 14 years ago, settling on Long Island,
his unfamiliarity with the term is understandable. But what would
the reformers of yesteryear say if they heard that at a rent of
almost $1,300 a month he is living in an apartment that is only 10
feet wide and 20 feet long?
</P>
<P>
   It has a living room, with a stove, refrigerator and sink on one
side, and a bedroom. The bathroom is about 7 feet square. Lenox
Hill Hospital, which is around the corner, is the tenant of record
and pays part of the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very small and there's not much light, but convenience is
the main reason I live there,'' Khodadadian said. ``Actually when I
moved in two years ago I was on the first floor in under 150 square
feet. I've moved up in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are living in an era of tenement renaissance, and
the rents that a tenement building like 167 East 77th St. can
capture because of its Upper East Side location are only one side
of the story. Another side is that it is happening with both public
and private investment, sometimes in the same project, and in
Manhattan it encompasses neighborhoods that vary greatly in average
household income.
</P>
<P>
   As a housing type, tenements are nothing more than residential
buildings constructed for use by three families or more before
changes in building standards were made by the Multiple Dwelling
Law of 1929. The critical change was that all windows that provide
light and ventilation had to be at least 30 feet from any wall or
other obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   After that, new apartments had more light and air, although
because of the Depression, it took years before many were built. In
tenements of earlier vintage many apartments are dark and airless
because interior windows face narrow light shafts, if there are
interior windows at all.
</P>
<P>
   Tenements were built by the thousands in the middle and late
19th century and the early 1900s under regulations that
progressively introduced higher standards for light and air and
fire safety. They are classified as Old Law tenements when they
were built under the rules of the Tenement House Act of 1879, and
New Law tenements when built under reform legislation adopted in
1901.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pre-Old Law tenements, built both before and
after the initial Tenement House Act of 1867.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Law (1879) gave rise to narrow interior light shafts in
tenement buildings, at first mere slots, and then wider openings
athwart a building shaped like an upside-down T when viewed
head-on, and finally two air shafts, usually 18 feet wide, in a
dumbbell-shaped building. Many Old Law tenements are 80 feet long,
built on lots 20 to 25 feet wide and 100 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   The New Law (1901) mandated lot coverage of no more than 70
percent, replacing the unenforceable 65 percent maximum in the Old
Law, according to Richard Plunz in his 1990 book ``A History of
Housing in New York City,'' published by Columbia University Press.
But air-shaft dimensions were increased to courtyard size, obliging
builders to utilize larger sites.
</P>
<P>
   These and other rules gave rise to pre-World War II buildings
that provide superior housing to this day. The better New Law
buildings were called apartment houses. ``Middle-class people
didn't want to say they lived in a tenement,'' Plunz said.
</P>
<P>
   The early tenements, with small and poorly ventilated rooms and
possibly toilets in rear-yard outhouses or hallways, became
synonymous with the overcrowded, unsanitary and unsafe housing
conditions of the immigrant poor on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these conditions still exist. ``What I see,'' said
Victor Papa, the court-appointed administrator of a building near
Chinatown, ``is what Jacob Riis saw _ squalid situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Riis was the 19th-century writer who turned tenement reform into
a crusade with newspaper articles and then a book, ``How the Other
Half Lives,'' in 1889.
</P>
<P>
   Papa runs the 1904 midblock tenement at 211 Madison St., between
Clinton and Rutgers streets. It is in a section of the city that is
densely populated by Chinese immigrants, many of whom are crowded
into small apartments with outmoded appliances and poorly
functioning plumbing. ``I see cramped apartments, rodents, broken
windows,'' Papa said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen of the 20 apartments in 211 Madison have tubs in the
kitchen and tiny toilet rooms, as they did nearly 100 years ago,
Papa said. Rents average only $312 a month, although the existing
tenants, faithful rent-payers, could probably pay twice that
amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Papa said he hopes to get a low-interest city loan of about
$20,000 an apartment to improve the building. He said he considers
long-term owner negligence to be the principal cause of the
building's conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What has brought so many tenements back _ with modernized
apartments _ has been a combination of forces: governmental subsidy
programs and the inability of the private market to supply enough
new apartments for a mass market, and the rising level of market
rents in Manhattan locations that are filled with tenement
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Since contemporary society resists the relocations that are
necessary for demolition and the construction of modern buildings
in the areas of greatest housing demand, rehabilitation becomes a
housing safety valve.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results are the anomalies suggested by Khodadadian's
situation: For the privilege of living in a strong market location
he is paying a higher rent for less space in an old building than a
low-income tenant is paying in East Harlem or West Harlem for a new
family-sized apartment built or renovated with city subsidies.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Newly built apartments in gut-renovated _ and usually subsidized
_ buildings are perhaps the cream of late 20th-century tenement
housing stock. Next in line come the moderate rehabilitations done
to occupied tenement buildings. In the private market, improvements
are made to individual apartments only after long-term tenants
vacate. But in subsidized projects building-wide improvements are
combined with the reconstruction of bathrooms and kitchens even in
occupied apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, one goes to residential buildings that years ago
fell into city hands through foreclosure to find the finest
examples of tenement revival in Manhattan. And one goes to areas of
market strength, where the private market is able to upgrade
apartments without public assistance, to find the oldest tenement
buildings upgraded with modernized, if often quite small,
apartments for incoming tenants.
</P>
<P>
   On East 13th Street between Avenue A and Avenue B in the East
Village, Dana Discordia, a 33-year-old actor and filmmaker who grew
up in Saugerties, rented a 250-square-foot apartment two months ago
up one flight of stairs at the rear of the building, paying $815 a
month. ``I found a pullout couch that was 5 feet 1 inch long _ it
wasn't easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also found privacy, his goal after living with a roommate on
Bleecker Street and paying half the $612 rent each month. ``There
the bathroom was in the hallway, but here it's inside, and that's a
plus,'' Discordia said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Eldon Bullock, who is also an actor, lives in a
modern fourth-floor one-bedroom apartment at 827 10th Ave., near
55th Street. It was renovated with tenants in occupancy four years
ago at a cost of $40,000 an apartment under the city's Tenant
Interim Lease program. The building was one of five contiguous
occupied 1880s tenements on an urban-renewal site.
</P>
<P>
   With Bullock taking the lead, the tenants organized and
ultimately bought the building from the city for $1, later
converting it to a limited-equity co-op by making an equity payment
to the co-op of $250 a unit. Bullock now pays maintenance of $403 a
month for 600 square feet of well-lighted modern space on the
fourth floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Settlement Housing Fund, the nonprofit company that served
as the tenants' development consultant, has itself been involved in
upgrading 86 tenement buildings with 3,000 apartments over the last
27 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renovating these buildings isn't an easy thing to do,'' said
Carol Lamberg, executive director of the Settlement Housing Fund
``Each one is unique. It's not a cookie cutter. You can't do things
on the cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost constraints are a constant issue between developers and the
city government in tenement renovations. Current controversies in
gut renovation often revolve around the question of whether
elevators should be installed in six-story tenements that are being
totally rebuilt, or whether trash chutes should be installed so
that tenants don't have to carry garbage to the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   A high-cost renovation to a six-story building that is left a
walk-up may prove a poor investment in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   But basically these buildings, rebuilt for low- or
moderate-income tenants, get far more dollars invested in them than
do the privately owned tenements, which usually need less systems
replacement. Many government-assisted buildings were vacant or
severely deteriorated when work began, and that alone means higher
costs per apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Vacancy has important advantages in housing restoration. It
leads to better buildings, and imaginative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Mandel, the principal in the architectural firm bearing
his name, has been the architect in 20 city-assisted gut
rehabilitations of Manhattan tenements since 1980, usually working
on behalf nonprofit developers.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Hope Community Inc., as the nonprofit developer,
completed the amalgamation of a strip of five Old Law tenements
east of Fifth Avenue on 110th Street into a single modern elevator
building, 8-18 East 110th St. A center hall runs east and west
through all five buildings on all five floors. There are 59
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   A new five-story element with the lobby and the elevator was
built on what had been vacant land at the west side of the
tenements. ``That structure made it possible for us to construct
essentially a single new elevator building,'' Mandel said.
</P>
<P>
   But from the outside it looks like a strip of Old Law walk-ups.
Tenants pay $400 to $600 a month for apartments that range in size
from studios to three-bedrooms. Financing came from the federal
government's low-income tax-credit program and a long-term 1
percent mortgage from the city.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, on East 115th Street between First and Pleasant
avenues, a series of empty Old Law and early New Law tenements were
rebuilt with a small park in the middle where a building once
stood. ``In the early days I kissed off Old Law tenements,'' Mandel
said. ``But if we aren't forced to reuse the old interior light
shafts for bedroom light, they have real potential.''
</P>
<P>
   As rehabilitations rather than new buildings, bedrooms with
windows facing shafts are legal. And the higher the bedroom count
in an apartment, the larger the subsidy a low-income apartment is
entitled to. Therefore there is an incentive to create high bedroom
counts, which can mean chopped-up apartments with poorly lighted
interior rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way to get family-sized units into Old Law
tenements,'' said Beth Cooper Lawrence, a Manhattan architect.
</P>
<P>
   Often tenants themselves want more bedrooms, however tiny they
are. That has been the experience of Robert Perl, president of
Tower Brokerage on East 10th Street, the owner-developer in 25
tenement renovations since 1985, mainly in the East Village and
Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In three 1880s tenements at 213 to 217 East 10th St., for
example, he has upgraded half the 70 apartments over the last six
years as tenants have moved, totally gutting, reconfiguring and
re-equipping those that had had very long-term occupancy by the
prior tenant. Twenty long-occupied units still have old-fashioned
tubs in the kitchen for bathing, and tiny but ventilated rooms for
a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many arrivals are singles in their 20s and they want separate
bedrooms,'' Perl said. Typically, two singles with incomes of
$30,000 to $50,000 a year rent 450 square feet of modern space with
a full ``three-piece'' bathroom _ sink, toilet, and either a tub
with a shower or a shower stall _ paying from $1,100 to $1,400 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Many apartments are in dumbbell-style buildings, with two
apartments in front, two in the rear, with a center stairway, small
corridors and a narrow air shaft between buildings. Rehabilitation
upon vacancy may not produce an apartment reconfiguration, as it
usually does in vacant tenements when public financing is
available.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What would Jacob Riis say about these conditions, Perl was
asked. ``Jacob Riis would be thrilled,'' he said. He noted that
there are full bathrooms with sink, toilet and tubs or showers,
plus adequate light and air, and few young children to generate
overcrowding. ``We have modern apartments for students and young
professionals starting careers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the East Village renovator will look for much
higher rents. Perl spoke of a vacant rundown tenement at 510 East
11th St., which he renovated three years ago for $300,000, putting
in a pub on the ground floor and three floor-through apartments
upstairs. The apartments were rented at about $2,500 a month.
``They're worth about $3,000 now,'' Perl said.
</P>
<P>
   Builders often say that the cost of gut-renovating and
rebuilding an individual Old Law tenement is not justified by the
quality of the building and apartments that result.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases it would make more sense to build new efficient
multiple dwellings instead of renovating the old tenements,'' said
Jeffrey Levine, the principal in Levine Builders of Douglaston,
Queens. He spoke from the experience of having renovated many an
old tenement.
</P>
<P>
   At 350 West 14th St., on Ninth Avenue, Levine consolidated four
vacant tenements and added three floors above with duplex
apartments with terraces, creating 49 condominium apartments for
the developer Alan Friedberg in 1987. The apartments sold out in
six months at an average price of $175,000.
</P>
<P>
   Levine was also the builder in the gut renovation of three Old
Law tenements on West 116th Street just east of Frederick Douglass
Boulevard. They stand in the midst of similar but unrenovated
tenements of the same vintage, enhancing the value of the entire
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   This work was done with financing from the city's
participation-loan program, which has been one of the key financial
engines for tenement improvement work. Blended with private
market-rate financing, the public-private loan holds rents down.
</P>
<P>
   The city has financed or helped finance rehabilitations in 703
tenement buildings since 1994, the start of the Giuliani
administration, and the Department of Housing Preservation and
Development expects to fund 423 more over the next two years. In
prior administrations many more were financed, but the figures were
not available.
</P>
<P>
   Tenement renovations are under way without public assistance as
well, most recently gaining steam in East Harlem. The most active
company is R.E. Management, at Third Avenue and 99th Street, the
owner of 50 buildings with 1,200 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Its ``crown jewel'' is the six-story walk-up at 244 East 117th
St., said Leonard Pikaard Jr., executive vice president. Only last
year a total renovation was completed, creating 41 apartments. Now
these small but well-equipped and well-lighted apartments provide
young one- and two-person households with modern apartments renting
for $800 to $1,100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The developer spent an average of $50,000 an apartment to put in
all new building systems, new windows, a new roof and doors, and
new apartment interiors. In addition, there is marble in the foyer,
ceramic-tile floors, a new marble stairway in the center and a new
intercom system.
</P>
<P>
   In consideration of the fact that the market principally
consists of young adults without children, the developer maintained
the high apartment count of the unrenovated tenement. Many
apartments have no more than 450 square feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to gear renovations to the Section 8 and welfare
market, which basically meant a mother with several children, so we
had a lot of bedrooms,'' Pikaard said. ``Now we're gearing
buildings to younger families, so we have fewer bedrooms and larger
rooms, but the same number of apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   On East 114th Street, between Pleasant and First avenues
opposite Jefferson Park, a typical tenement renovation approach is
under way. As two-bedroom railroad flats are vacated, they are
converted into large studios, renting for about $800 a month. Five
years ago, each railroad flat _ a floor-through with small rooms in
a straight row _ would have become one subsidized three-bedroom
apartment, Pikaard said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the company's apartments have not been
renovated in over 50 years, Pikaard said. ``Some of them look as
though they've been trashed, but others have been well taken care
of, even though the equipment is antique,'' he said. Most of these
are rent-controlled units renting for $70 to $300 a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One long-term low-rent tenant in a postage-stamp size apartment
is Frank Reginio, 79, who retired as a postal worker in 1974 and
has lived at 235 East 111th St., second floor rear, since 1944. His
mother-in-law had the twin apartment next door when he moved in,
and when she died in the 1960s he and his wife took it over. They
now pay $75 for each apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I raised two children here,'' Reginio said. ``We
used to have to make two coal fires every day in the stove for
heat, until they put steam in.'' He still has a tub in the kitchen
for bathing. His mother-in-law's apartment is for sleeping. ``I
wouldn't want to move,'' he said. ``I'm used to it here. I'm used
to the neighborhood. I feel safe in it. Where would I move to?''

THE UNDERMANNED NETS STILL OVERCOME THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With Jayson Williams, their leading
warrior, in the hospital with his broken right leg immobilized, the
Nets played with the desire and intensity that Williams so often
exhibited to defeat the Miami Heat, 88-77, Saturday at the
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, a huge upset that gave the Nets two straight
victories for the first time in this bizarre season, came one game
after Williams suffered his season-ending injury in a 90-85 victory
over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (19-11) had demolished the Nets (7-24) in two previous
meetings this season, winning by a combined total of 49 points.
Alonzo Mourning, the brutish center who is playing as well as
anyone in the league, treated New Jersey as his own little punching
bag, totaling 49 points, 28 rebounds and 9 blocks in the two games.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams _ not to mention his backups Jim McIlvaine and
Rony Seikaly _ out with injuries, the sentiment going in was that
Mourning would have a heyday against the small, depleted Nets and
their inexperienced starter, Will Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning indeed had his way, recording 23 points, 17 rebounds
and seemingly blocking one out of every three Nets' shots in
swatting away nine. But the Nets overcame his dominance with
hustle, balance and ferocity, and attacked the basket to foul him
out with 3 minutes 53 seconds remaining and the Nets ahead by
77-69.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn led the Nets with 27 points, but shot only 6 for
24 from the floor. Though his touch was missing, Van Horn, who was
4 for 20 entering the fourth, scored six straight points to spark
an 11-2 run midway through the fourth that put the Nets up by 13
points with 6:27 left to play. Chris Carr's 3-pointer made it
74-61.
</P>
<P>
   Miami pulled within 80-74 on a 3-pointer by Terry Porter with
1:11 left to play, but Stephon Marbury scored on the Nets' next two
possessions on a driving layup and two free throws that sealed it.
Marbury, whose backup Elliot Perry played exceptionally well,
finished with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Though he scored only 15 points, Kendall Gill was the Nets' star
because of his defensive brilliance. Recording his first
triple-double as a Net, Gill grabbed 10 rebounds and made an
incredible 11 steals, which broke assistant coach Eddie Jordan's
franchise record of 10. His final rebound came on the last shot of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth straight loss for Pat Riley's Heat.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A spirited second quarter by the Nets shocked nearly everyone at
Continental Arena, especially the Heat. Playing outstanding
defense, New Jersey outscored Miami by 28-14 in the quarter to turn
a 24-16 first-quarter deficit into a 44-38 halftime lead. The most
remarkable thing about the run was that much of it occurred with
Marbury, Van Horn and Kerry Kittles on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   A Nets' lineup of Gill, Elliot Perry, Mark Hendrickson, Jamie
Feick and Chris Carr outscored Miami by 11-4 over a 3 minute 41
second stretch to give the Nets a 30-28 lead midway through the
quarter. Gill, whose tremendous defense helped the Nets defeat the
Atlanta Hawks on Thursday, was key again, making five of the club's
six steals in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's hustle, combined with the team's excellent rotations,
enabled the Nets to limit Miami to just six field goal attempts
over the first seven and a half minutes of the quarter. With no
true center on the floor, Casey and his main assistants, Jim Lynam
and Eddie Jordan, had the Nets rotating and trapping in ways that
disrupted the Heat's attack. The Nets also used a half-court trap
that sped up the game and helped nullify Miami's size advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, streaking in the open court, carried much of the load
offensively as well, scoring six points. Carr, who hoisted nine
shots in the quarter, scored eight points, and Feick helped the
Nets outrebound Miami in the first half with four second-quarter
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury and Van Horn returned with 6 minutes 2 seconds left in
the half and, seemingly energized by the play of the reserves,
sparked the Nets to a 12-2 run that pushed the lead to 12 points,
42-30, on a 3-pointer by Marbury three minutes before the half. One
minute later, Casey reinserted Kittles, who had sat out the entire
quarter, for Gill.
</P>
<P>
   The move backfired, as the defensive intensity dropped
immediately, and Miami cut the lead to six by intermission. The
Heat, probably responding to a vigorous tongue-lashing by their
head coach, Pat Riley, opened the third quarter fiercely, pulling
within two points twice in the first four and a half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nets had the answer in Marbury. Hitting a 16-footer, two
driving layups and a free throw, the fearless point guard helped
rebuild the Nets' lead to 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gill continued to shine on both ends of the floor, especially
defensively, as New Jersey limited Miami to six made shots (two of
which came on goaltending calls against Van Horn ) in the quarter.
Confident and at their best, the Nets led by 61-52 heading into the
final period.

DROP ANCHOR, NO PROBLEM. BUT NOW TRY PULLING IT UP.

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, Calif., R.I.)   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Competitive sailors, buoyed by tactical skills
and time on the water, generally assume a take-it-or-leave-it
approach when it comes to physical fitness. As chewing gum is to a
baseball player, fitness training has been a personal thing for
sailors. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the U.S. Sailing Team has hired a roving
strength and conditioning coach. On a commercial level, one of the
top female sailors in the country recently produced an extensive
exercise videotape geared for boaters at sea or on the dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing is not more physical than it used to be,'' Jonathan
Harley, Olympic director for U.S. Sailing, the sport's governing
body, said last week. ``But everybody else is treating it as
such.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, sailing and powerboating are sports that can require
as little energy as tweaking a mainsail sheet or throwing a dock
line. But at the highest rung of the sport, fitness is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Boaters often need abdominal and back muscles for such tasks as
pulling up an anchor, sheeting in a mainsail, or hiking out; arm
muscles for grinding on a winch or hauling an engine; and leg
muscles for lifting a spinnaker pole, or moving wet sails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing is like a big chess match,'' Harley said. ``It's a
fairly cerebral game. But at the Olympic level, sailors in foreign
countries with better funding than the United States are pouring
their money into people. We need to spend our own money
judiciously, but our people have got to get in better shape too.''
</P>
<P>
   Reality set in for the American team when it became apparent
that one-design classes such as the Finn, a boat once revered for
the brawny sailors it attracted, is now slimming down. A Finn
sailor a decade ago who weighed 210 pounds might well weigh 190
pounds today. Yet the 1990s sailor is likely to be stronger and
more agile.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to the workout focus is Betsy Alison, a four-time
yachtswoman of the year from Newport, R.I. She is currently
competing with an all-female crew in the International Rolex Cup
Regatta in St. Thomas, V.I. But off the water, Alison has a new
business.
</P>
<P>
   She and a partner, Sandy Hayes, began marketing a two-part
videotape two months ago entitled ``Fitness Afloat.'' Hayes, a
nationally certified personal trainer from Scituate, Mass., also
sails competitively. The 60-minute exercise program works best on
board a boat or at the dock, but is adaptable for home, too.
</P>
<P>
   Workout tools include a towel, a coiled line and a 26-inch boat
fender. Instead of weights, they also suggest using winch handles,
or bottled water. Their exercise mat is a boat deck _ a 40-foot
Tartan sailboat was used for the video. But nearly any boat will do
as long as it is big enough to stretch out on. ``Sandy used the
workout program on a boat-delivery home from Bermuda, and I've done
it on a trawler in Seattle,'' Alison said.
</P>
<P>
   The series focuses on the needs of boaters, both competitive and
recreational. Over all, balance is key.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of that theory came last March at the International
Sailing Federation World Championships in Dubai, United Arab
Emirates. Alison's team won a gold medal in the women's
match-racing event, and a silver in fleet racing. She and two
teammates each were 38 years old; a fourth teammate was 28. The
all-female crew had worked out ahead of time in the fitness series
they helped develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in tired at the end of the day, but we never hurt even
though we sailed 38 races in 11 days,'' Alison said. ``A lot of the
other sailors were Olympic competitors, and we heard them complain
way more than I thought possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison's team did not do as well at the Congressional Cup
regatta last month in Long Beach, Calif. But it was not because of
poor fitness. The team was in 10th _ and last _ among a group of
mostly America's Cup-level men's teams. ``The guys had experience
over us,'' Alison said. ``But we were steadily improving all week,
and won a couple of starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alison-Hayes videotape series ($39.99) is meant for men and
women, but its degree of difficulty depends on the person.
Information can be obtained by calling (877) FIT-AFLOAT. An
unrelated book on the subject, ``Sailing Fitness'' ($30.95 from
Fitness Books) by Dr. Michael Blackburn, can be ordered from the
Armchair Sailor Bookstore in Newport, R.I., (800-29-CHART). &QL;

 &HT;    New season begins in Mexico
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the San Diego Padres intend to make it back to the
World Series next fall, they'll have a long way to go. Like from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 baseball season commences tonight in Monterrey, Mexico,
where the Padres face Colorado at 8 o'clock. Last week Cuba, this
week the Mexican coast. Is this the big leagues, or a Caribbean
tour excursion?
</P>
<P>
   Monterrey is giddy in hosting the first season opener ever held
in its country. When a final batch of tickets went on sale
Thursday, a crowd of 1,000 had gathered by 2 a.m. The game site
becomes doubly significant to Rockies third baseman Vinny Castilla,
born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and one of the most prominent Mexican stars
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait. I just can't wait,'' Castilla said. ''The people
in my country will give me so much support and appreciation. Now
they'll get to see me for the first time. Baseball has never had an
opening day in Mexico. We're talking about a very historic game.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also talking about the best Canadian-born player.
Rockies right fielder Larry Walker could open the season on the
disabled list after sustaining a strained rib cage muscle Tuesday
while taking batting practice. The Rockies were scrambling Saturday
for contingencies for replacing one of the game's most productive
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't have somebody, we've got a good enough team where
we can pick each other up,'' Rockies manager Jim Leyland said.
''Nobody wants to lose a player, especially a player of his
magnitude. But what the hell? That's part of the game. You can't
roll over.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on opening day. The rest of the majors pick up the
schedule Monday with a full slate of games. The Braves open the
year with a three-game series with Philadelphia beginning Monday at
4:10 p.m. Tom Glavine, 20-6 last year when he won his second Cy
Young award, will face Phillies ace Curt Schilling (15-14), opening
a seven-game homestand.

 &HT;    Lottery jackpot rolls over to $190 million
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Big Game? Fat chance!
</P>
<P>
   Nobody won Friday's record $160 million Big Game jackpot,
meaning the money will be rolled over into the next drawing, to be
held at 11 p.m. Tuesday. The new jackpot will be worth an estimated
$190 million, said Georgia Lottery spokeswoman Parquita Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers drawn were 8-25-26-28-35 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   Although the odds are slim _ about 1 in 76 million _ of winning
the six-state lottery, people were snatching up tickets at a
frenzied pace just before the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sellers, a clerk at a Chevron service station in Marietta,
had six customers waiting in line for tickets when sales ended at
10:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody don't win it Tuesday, they'll probably have to
hire all new cashiers for the store,'' said Sellers, 54. ``I have
worked every Tuesday and Friday night for the past month, and I am
dead tired when I get off work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although $190 million is a lot of money, the largest-ever
lottery jackpot was won by 13 factory workers in Columbus, Ohio,
last July. The winning Powerball ticket was worth $295.7 million.

 &HT;    NATO FIGHTS TWO ENEMIES: SERBS AND HUMAN MISERY
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Clinton administration declaring that ``no
target is off-limits'' in Yugoslavia, NATO destroyed another bridge
across the Danube River Saturday. At the same time, the alliance
raced to stop a ``demographic earthquake'' in the Balkans as
hundreds of thousands of refugees flee into the countries bordering
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus on the alliance ... is very, very much on the
demographic earthquake that we are experiencing in and around
Kosovo,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels. He spoke as
NATO prepared to use ground troops to help provide humanitarian
relief to the ethnic Albanians who have fled Kosovo since the
bombing of Yugoslavia began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   But as NATO turned its attention to the refugee problem, it also
continued its bombing campaign, now aimed at Yugoslavia's largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Serb television reported NATO destroyed a second Danube River
bridge, this one in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia's second largest city and
a major industrial center. The bridge was struck just hours after
allied missiles turned key government buildings in Belgrade, the
country's capital, into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the misery of refugees, Shea said NATO is
mobilizing ``all its available resources for this urgent
humanitarian requirement.'' He said allied ambassadors had asked
Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, NATO's commander, for a
plan to deploy up to 8,000 troops to Albania as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 24 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit,
aboard ships now in the Adriatic, were dispatched Saturday to
Macedonia and Albania to help NATO assess the humanitarian needs
there.
</P>
<P>
   The ``demographic earthquake'' consists of an estimated 290,000
refugees who have left Kosovo in the last 10 days. More than
100,000 have arrived in Albania, where 6,000 NATO troops were
dispatched to help them. Another 65,000 refugees are trapped in
cold, muddy fields in Macedonia. There, where NATO peacekeeping
forces vacated their own barracks to provide shelter to some of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate, if you do a mathematical calculation, Serb
forces will have emptied Kosovo of its entire population in 10 to
20 days,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo's neighbors facing a humanitarian disaster, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana suggested that an alliance-led
protection force could go into Kosovo to return ethnic Albanian
refugees ahead of any signing by Yugoslavia of a peace agreement.
But NATO officials emphasized that NATO ground forces are not
prepared to invade Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a C-17 left Dover Air Force Base, Del., with a first
shipment of food relief to the Balkans. Its cargo is 30,000
high-calorie packaged meals destined for Albania, via an air base
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will use private airlines to ferry additional
rations throughout the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is also airlifting 200 tents, 1,500 cots, 3,000
blankets, 8,000 sleeping bags and cargo-handling equipment such as
forklifts to help speed the dispersal of the relief.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. European Command in Germany will begin shipping 80
U.S. military trucks and another 30 trucks purchased by the State
Department to Albania. The trucks will be used to move relief
supplies from ports and airports.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his weekly radio address, urged Americans
to contact charities, churches and international relief
organizations to assist in the relief effort. ``We will remind the
victims of this conflict that for all they have lost they have not
been abandoned or forgotten,'' he said on the eve of the Christian
celebration of Easter.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has directed $91 million in humanitarian aid
to the region since last year. And last week, Clinton authorized
another $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the president was calling on Americans to ``open our
hearts and our arms'' to the refugees and to pray for the three
American soldiers being held prisoner in Yugoslavia, the spokesman
for his National Security Council was sending a chilling warning to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. That warning came one day
after cruise missiles destroyed a complex of government offices in
downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that no target is off-limits that is involved
in the repression of Kosovo, including downtown Belgrade,'' said
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy. ``As we move
forward in the days to come, we will continue to intensify the
strikes to make clear to Mr. Milosevic our determination to
significantly degrade his military capability,'' Leavy added.
</P>
<P>
   The message translated into new orders Saturday for the U.S.S.
Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear aircraft carrier with 75 aircraft,
including 46 strike planes. The carrier, known as the ``Big
Stick,'' was ordered to the Adriatic Sea instead of the Persian
Gulf. The Roosevelt battle group includes four cruisers, destroyers
and frigates, a combat support ship and a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also dispatched another 13 F-117A stealth
fighter-bombers from Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., to join NATO's
air campaign against Yugoslavia. Due to arrive Sunday, the
additional planes will bring to 24 the number of F-117s available
for missions. One crashed in Yugoslavia on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   In his address Saturday, Clinton once again reminded Americans
that the military mission in Kosovo is ``a difficult and dangerous
one,'' but contended that it is ``necessary and right.''
</P>
<P>
   But British Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered the sternest
message yet to Milosevic. In a television interview, Blair said,
``Your policy of ethnic cleansing is an act of barbarity. We will
defeat you.''

country's capital, into rubble.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the misery of refugees, Shea said NATO is
mobilizing ``all its available resources for this urgent
humanitarian requirement.'' He said allied ambassadors had asked
Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, NATO's commander, for a
plan to deploy up to 8,000 troops to Albania as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 24 Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit,
aboard ships now in the Adriatic, were dispatched Saturday to
Macedonia and Albania to help NATO assess the humanitarian needs
there.
</P>
<P>
   The ``demographic earthquake'' consists of an estimated 290,000
refugees who have left Kosovo in the last 10 days. More than
100,000 have arrived in Albania, where 6,000 NATO troops were
dispatched to help them. Another 65,000 refugees are trapped in
cold, muddy fields in Macedonia. There, where NATO peacekeeping
forces vacated their own barracks to provide shelter to some of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this rate, if you do a mathematical calculation, Serb
forces will have emptied Kosovo of its entire population in 10 to
20 days,'' Shea said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo's neighbors facing a humanitarian disaster, NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana suggested that an alliance-led
protection force could go into Kosovo to return ethnic Albanian
refugees ahead of any signing by Yugoslavia of a peace agreement.
But NATO officials emphasized that NATO ground forces are not
prepared to invade Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a C-17 left Dover Air Force Base, Del., with a first
shipment of food relief to the Balkans. Its cargo is 30,000
high-calorie packaged meals destined for Albania, via an air base
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will use private airlines to ferry additional
rations throughout the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is also airlifting 200 tents, 1,500 cots, 3,000
blankets, 8,000 sleeping bags and cargo-handling equipment such as
forklifts to help speed the dispersal of the relief.
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. European Command in Germany will begin shipping 80
U.S. military trucks and another 30 trucks purchased by the State
Department to Albania. The trucks will be used to move relief
supplies from ports and airports.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in his weekly radio address, urged Americans
to contact charities, churches and international relief
organizations to assist in the relief effort. ``We will remind the
victims of this conflict that for all they have lost they have not
been abandoned or forgotten,'' he said on the eve of the Christian
celebration of Easter.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has directed $91 million in humanitarian aid
to the region since last year. And last week, Clinton authorized
another $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the president was calling on Americans to ``open our
hearts and our arms'' to the refugees and to pray for the three
American soldiers being held prisoner in Yugoslavia, the spokesman
for his National Security Council was sending a chilling warning to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. That warning came one day
after cruise missiles destroyed a complex of government offices in
downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that no target is off-limits that is involved
in the repression of Kosovo, including downtown Belgrade,'' said
National Security Council spokesman David Leavy. ``As we move
forward in the days to come, we will continue to intensify the
strikes to make clear to Mr. Milosevic our determination to
significantly degrade his military capability,'' Leavy added.
</P>
<P>
   The message translated into new orders Saturday for the U.S.S.
Theodore Roosevelt, a nuclear aircraft carrier with 75 aircraft,
including 46 strike planes. The carrier, known as the ``Big
Stick,'' was ordered to the Adriatic Sea instead of the Persian
Gulf. The Roosevelt battle group includes four cruisers, destroyers
and frigates, a combat support ship and a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also dispatched another 13 F-117A stealth
fighter-bombers from Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., to join NATO's
air campaign against Yugoslavia. Due to arrive Sunday, the
additional planes will bring to 24 the number of F-117s available
for missions. One crashed in Yugoslavia on March 27.
</P>
<P>
   In his address Saturday, Clinton once again reminded Americans
that the military mission in Kosovo is ``a difficult and dangerous
one,'' but contended that it is ``necessary and right.''
</P>
<P>
   But British Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered the sternest
message yet to Milosevic. In a television interview, Blair said,
``Your policy of ethnic cleansing is an act of barbarity. We will
defeat you.''

 &HT;    FOR REFUGEES, FROM ONE HELL INTO ANOTHER
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHKODER, Albania A white, windowless van stops outside a white
stucco Catholic church here causing a cloud of gray dust to billow
under its wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteer church workers fling open the back door to show the
cargo. More than 20 refugees from Kosovo squint at the burst of
sunlight and begin to carefully unfold their arms and legs to step
down from the van.
</P>
<P>
   For seven hours, they have been jammed in the back of this
airless van, bouncing down a rough, winding mountain road from the
Kosovar border. They have been in the van since sunrise with
nothing to eat or drink. Most are women and children, with a few
gray-haired men. One tiny woman is in her 80s and must be helped
down and into a wheelchair. They appear dazed and exhausted as they
emerge, glancing indifferently at their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   This is their destination _ at least for a while _ after the
long exodus from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some have traveled five days from their homes inside Kosovo.
They tell the now familiar stories of being driven from their
houses by armed and masked Serbian paramilitaries. They reported
seeing bodies along the way and say that Serb forces beat refugees.
Many walked for more than 20 miles to reach the border, where they
were herded into the van and brought here.
</P>
<P>
   But they may have to move on soon. There is no room in Shkoder,
a desperately poor city already burdened by refugees who began
flooding in eight months ago as conditions in Kosovo worsened.
Despite the strain, they are welcome for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our brothers and we will welcome them,'' said Bisera
Bisdan, a Shkoder woman who was selling secondhand clothes at a
sidewalk flea market. ``But we are very poor. We live hand to
mouth. What can we give them?''
</P>
<P>
   The city can handle about 2,000 refugees by placing them in
temporary dormitories and private homes, municipal officials say.
But as of Saturday, more than 3,000 refugees had registered in the
city and more than 2,000 more were en route to a place already
unable to cope with them.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions in Shkoder, one of the half dozen destinations
for the Kosovar refugees in Albania, couldn't be more desperate. It
is remote from the capital of Tirana, located about 50 miles to the
south, and has barely enough food stores to feed the refugees
without pushing the whole town into even deeper despair. There are
no jobs for the residents, much less the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Shkoder illustrates the refugee crisis across Albania. Without
immediate help, the refugees will deplete the already limited
resources of the city, eventually making the plight of residents
and refugees hard to distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated that between 120,000 and 200,000 refugees
have come to Albania, Europe's poorest country. At the same time,
the pressure on Albania increased Saturday when neighboring
Macedonia said it would close its borders to refugees. Macedonia
called on its neighbors and the European Union to help shelter the
massive wave of ethnic Albanians. Many of the 50,000 waiting to
enter Macedonia are expected to head for Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of NATO bombing more than a week ago, there
were 26,000 refugees in Kosovo _ already considered the maximum
this very poor country could host.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is already a crisis,'' said Naim Zoto, the minister for
social affairs. ``The existing state structure will not be able to
cope with 200,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the country's bakeries have had their supplies
exhausted, and food merchants are raising prices to match growing
demands fueled by the crisis. Drinking water, urgently needed in
the explosion of makeshift refugee camps, is also in critically
short supply. Officials reported that six refugee children have
died from dehydration, while another seven adults have died from
various other causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can for a short time provide the basics _ a shelter to
sleep in and bread to eat,'' Zoto said. ``We're talking about the
very basic things a human being needs to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, officials express anxiety over what they consider a
very slow response by international aid agencies. Government
leaders worry that if aid efforts aren't accelerated immediately,
the death rate among the refugees will rise.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the road system in Albania is so poor that it will
be difficult to distribute supplies as they arrive, Zoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, traffic through Tirana has doubled with a sharp
increase in vans and heavy trucks carrying food and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   While Albanians have welcomed the refugees in their homes,
Albanian officials caution that they cannot long rely on individual
acts of generosity. In addition to the fact that most Albanian
families can barely support themselves, officials say that Kosovar
families _ they frequently number 30 or more _ often refuse to be
separated, thus making them difficult to place.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Albanians in the southern, more Mediterranean region of
the country have far less sympathy and will be less hospitable to
the refugees than those who live in the northern more mountainous
regions adjoining Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, the country's transition from a closed
communist society to an open free market has been arduous and
property ownership issues are often confusing. This makes it very
difficult for humanitarian agencies to acquire land for tent camps
or buildings to be converted into dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   This has forced the government to place refugees in public
places. Outside Tirana, more than 2,000 refugees live in a camp of
200 U.S. Army tents pitched around the drained swimming pools at
the city's aquatic center.
</P>
<P>
   In Shkoder, more than 600 refugees have been placed in the
city's Sports Palace, which is about the size of an average U.S.
high school gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   The decrepit old arena on Saturday was littered with food and
garbage. On the worn floor, teenage boys shot baskets with plastic
water bottles. Near nightfall, more than 2,000 more refugees were
expected to be crammed in the arena more than three times its
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   This prospect makes worries Titiana Littamel, an Italian who
teaches language at a university in Shkoder. Even before the
arrival of refugees, poverty-related crime has been so high in the
city that it has been dangerous for residents to venture out after
sunset. Gunfire fills the air each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot even think what it will be like,'' Littamel said.
``In the morning, then what? The problem is Shkoder it is simply
too poor. It cannot bear this.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are somewhat better at the dormitories built by the
Caratis relief agency at the Church of the Holy Rosary. The
dormitories, created from an old warehouse adjoining the church,
house 700 people, about 20 to a room. It looks like a prison, with
dark corridors and damp concrete floors. There is one toilet,
shower and sink for every ten families. All the laundry is done in
the sink. About 350 have lived there for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this is war,'' said Miska Hushi, a mother of four.
``Things could be worse, but this is not our home. People want to
live in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   When the van pulled up unexpectedly Saturday to dump 20 refugees
into the mission's care, the Franciscan monks who work there
scrambled to provide them food and water. The refugees were hustled
into the canteen and given beans, goat cheese and bottled water.
They ate and drank lustily. On one wall of the cinderblock dining
hall is written the phrase in Albanian: ``Kosovo is martyred.''
There also are pictures drawn by the children at the shelter; one
depicted the houses in her village with smoke rising from their
roofs.
</P>
<P>
   For Helena Palushaj, 17, of the Kosovo town of Kramovik, Sunday
was to be the most special day, her wedding day. Instead, she
arrived in the van here Saturday, her fiance missing.
</P>
<P>
   Helena and her father, Frrok (CQ), had been traveling for days,
often on foot after leaving their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My girl was to be married,'' said her father. ``Instead we are
here,'' he said, eating a piece of bread. ``It was to be the best
moment of our life. Now it is the worst. How can this happen?''

GROUP PLANS $1-MILLION MARCH TO PROTEST POLICE MISCONDUCT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of politicians, business executives,
religious leaders and community groups who banded together in
response to the shooting death of Amadou Diallo have turned their
energy to organizing a large demonstration aimed at illustrating
the breadth of emotion about police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say they have already raised about half the $1
million needed for the April 15 march from the federal court in
downtown Brooklyn to federal offices in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The wide coalition immersed in the planning includes labor
groups, Jewish organizations, gay civil rights advocates, state
legislators and veterans of the Rev. Al Sharpton's many protest
marches.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the event has taken the form of a high-voltage
political campaign. About a dozen strategists, including staff
members lent by elected officials and the city's largest labor
unions, have been working round the clock in an office on the
seventh floor of the headquarters of Local 1199, the National
Health and Human Service Employees Union on West 43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a prominent role is Sharpton, who has served as the
adviser to the family of Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant
who was struck down in a barrage of police gunfire in February in
the doorway of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199, has also played a major
role. And a group of business executives, led by Ed Lewis, the
publisher of Essence magazine, has raised money from other business
leaders to assist in advertising and promoting the march. Rivera
said the coalition has raised $470,000 so far.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the march are the same elected officials,
clergy and representatives of various community organizations who
met last week and listed 10 points to create ``a safer and more
just New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Those demands would involve, in some measure, changes in police
policies and the enactment of new state laws. They include hiring
of more black and Hispanic police officers, creating a permanent
special prosecutor for police brutality and corruption in New York,
strengthening the Civilian Complaint Review Board and ending the
use of hollow-point bullets. The organizers also want the Justice
Department to release annual reports documenting police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the legislators who have participated in the
coalition meetings acknowledged the difficulty in getting many of
their suggestions converted into law.
</P>
<P>
   In the State Assembly, for example, many members have already
introduced a proposed residency requirement for New York City
police officers and a bill that would bar what is known as the
48-hour rule from future contracts with the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The rule gives police officers two business days to consult with
union lawyers before they speak to investigators. It was not
invoked in the Diallo case because it applies only when the
department pursues administrative charges.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the bills have been introduced by Democrats, who
have failed to find sponsors in the Republican-controlled Senate.
``We know that some of it will not be easy to get passed,'' said
Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright, a Harlem Democrat who is chairman of
the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Caucus.

JURORS WILL SEE DUELING IMAGES OF JOHN A. GOTTI DURING TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A soft-spoken, selfless, self-made businessman who
lavishly supports charities for abused and abandoned children.
</P>
<P>
   An arrogant, brawling, greedy mobster who relishes the illicit
wealth that flows to him as the leader of one of the nation's most
powerful Mafia groups.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Januslike descriptions of John A. Gotti that will
begin unfolding on Tuesday when jury selection begins at his trial
in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti is accused of being the acting boss of the Gambino crime
family and of leading a criminal enterprise that reaped more than
$20 million from Mafia rackets in the New York City region from the
mid-1980s to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The battle looms as one of the most significant mob trials of
the decade. Mafia experts say Gotti's conviction would almost
certainly destroy the Gotti faction's domination of the family and
would probably eliminate the Gambino family as one of the major
powers in America's Mafia. Gotti's father, John J. Gotti, 58, is
serving a life sentence for murder and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   For federal prosecutors, the case appears to have weakened since
the younger Gotti was indicted with 22 other defendants in January
1998. An acquittal of Gotti, the main target of a complex
three-year federal-state investigation, would stall the
government's campaign to dismantle the Gambino family.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, who insists he has no links to organized crime, has
rejected government deals for a prison sentence of about six years
in exchange for a guilty plea to reduced charges. By risking a
trial, Gotti, 35, may face 20 years in prison if convicted of
violating the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, known as RICO.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that Gotti has strived to remake
his public image in recent years, realizing that he was under
investigation and that he would eventually face racketeering
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation, the officials add, began before his
indictment and included frequent appearances at parent-teacher
meetings and visits in which he delivered cookies for parties at
his children's schools. Gotti also spent more evenings at his
14-room, $700,000 home in Mill Neck, Nassau County, with his wife,
Kim, and four children instead of maintaining his previous schedule
of late nights in bars and dance clubs, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti has also become a generous contributor to hospitals that
help abused children and to Hale House, which cares for infants
exposed to illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti has altered his appearance as well. A stocky man, 5 feet 9
inches tall, who keeps in shape by weight lifting, he now dresses
conservatively in suit jackets with a tie or stylish turtleneck
shirts instead of in his customary attire of a track suit or jeans,
a windbreaker and a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in a request that stunned defense lawyers and
prosecutors, Gotti, who has been under house arrest since October,
asked a judge to revoke his $10 million bail and agreed to be
jailed for the duration of his trial, which is expected to last
about two months. His lawyers had indicated that he was
impoverished and unable to pay $24,000 a month for the guards who
monitor his movements. But some federal and state investigators
said the request might be a ploy to gain sympathy and to refute
government contentions that he grew rich from crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like his father, he is very publicity conscious,'' said Bruce
Mouw, a former agent with the FBI who led the bureau's Gambino
squad until his retirement last year. ``He and his father have
their own spin machines, but he really has not changed.''

they will have to look closely to find the hottest issue on the
ballot.

   How a straightforward attempt to legalize concealed firearms
became a brainteaser on the ballot is a lesson in political

<P>
   Secretary of State Rebecca Cook adopted the ballot language last
January after a lawsuit required the state to throw out language
stipulated by the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The result was something of a patchwork proposal suggested by
the sponsors of the referendum _ Rep. Wayne Crump of Potosi and
Sen. Harold Caskey of Butler _ and House Speaker Steve Gaw, Senate
leader Ed Quick of Liberty and Alex Bartlett, an attorney for gun
opponents who sued to block the lawmakers' version.

<P>
   The original language, crafted by the bill's supporters,
contained more than 50 words, which is prohibited by law. But it
also contained loaded phrases to make the referendum more palatable
to voters who might feel uneasy about their neighbors toting
concealed firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature's language talked about ``law-abiding citizens''
carrying firearms ``for personal protection,'' when the proposal
would allow people guilty of serious misdemeanors to get permits to
carry firearms for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Mills, a former state Highway Patrol superintendent who
opposes concealed firearms, sued to block the language from
appearing on the Tuesday ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cole County Circuit Court ruled that state law requires the
secretary of state, not the legislature, to draft an impartial
ballot description.
</P>
<P>
   So Cook began taking suggestions on ballot phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the parameters of the law, the secretary wanted to
reach a consensus,'' said June Doughty, Cook's general counsel.
``The goal was to find language that would avoid litigation or at
least withstand a legal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, Crump sent Cook a memo suggesting a 48-word
description that talked about law-abiding citizens getting gun
permits after passing a criminal background check and completing a
firearms training course.
</P>
<P>
   Other legislative leaders submitted oral recommendations,
Doughty said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Doughty asked for feedback on three versions. One
was Crump's version. The second asked whether Missouri should no
longer consider it a felony to carry a concealed firearm unless the
carrier lacks a permit.
</P>
<P>
   The third asked whether sheriffs should issue permits to carry
concealed firearms up to 16 inches long and let permit-holders
carry the firearms anywhere but church, school or government
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Crump sent a memo back objecting to the second and third
proposals. At a meeting Jan. 21, Cook suggested the following
wording: ``Shall sheriffs be required to issue permits to carry
concealed firearms to citizens who satisfy various statutory
requirements?''
</P>
<P>
   A later memo suggests controversy about ``sheriffs'' as opposed
to ``law enforcement'' and about ``citizens'' as opposed to
``persons.'' Questions were raised about ``be required.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, the attorney for Mills, later questioned how the bill
would apply to St. Louis County, where the bill would give the
police chief, not the sheriff, the authority to issue permits.
</P>
<P>
   Cook finally settled on this: ``Shall sheriffs, or in the case
of St. Louis County, the chief of police, be required to issue
permits to carry concealed firearms to citizens who apply if
various statutory requirements are satisfied?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point,'' Doughty said, ``was to get an accurate
summary in the form of a question that people would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that was accomplished is debatable. But the wording did
satisfy the courts, which tossed out a legal challenge from gun
supporters.

CONTRARY TO ECONOMIC REPORT, THINGS ARE BETTER NOW THAN IN THE
'70S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The wet-blanket brigade's stock in trade is
socioeconomic observations that are not only implausible but also
pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a class-warfare outfit calling itself United for a
Fair Economy issued a report trying to make the case that Americans
are worse off today than in the early '70s. If anybody thinks that,
they either weren't around back then or suffer from amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   One assertion in this regard is that U.S. workers earn less in
inflation-adjusted terms than they did a generation ago. Another
claim is that only the rich are benefiting from the stock market
boom because wealth is becoming more concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how one wants to slice and dice economic data,
there are probably statistics to support these views. Those with an
ax to grind always find a way to massage numbers of choice to make
any point they wish. However, those who insist on using data
selectively to substantiate improbable claims are like the drunk
who finds a lamppost more useful for support than for illumination.
</P>
<P>
   As Benjamin Disraeli once noted, there are ``lies, damned lies
and statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any human with powers of reasoning and observation
can't help but conclude that most Americans are materially better
off now than they were a quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published book entitled Myths of the Rich and Poor is
said to do a good job of making that point. Its thesis is that the
true economic state of the human condition is better assessed by
observing consumption patterns than wealth and income statistics.
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense, because personal consumption fuels two-thirds
of economic growth. The U.S. economy has been expanding almost
nonstop since the early '80s. It's not just the richies spending
the money driving this boom. Consumer behavior reflects broad-based
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's the point of the exercise? Is the implied goal
to achieve passage of laws ensuring a ``fair share'' of economic
output for everyone?
</P>
<P>
   The most impoverished societies in human history have resulted
from proletariat uprisings seeking equal distribution of economic
resources. Russia comes immediately to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Such exercises become even more pointless when viewed in the
context of alternatives. Even Sweden, a model of enlightened
socialism, has been forced to acknowledge the limits of trying to
create economic equality.
</P>
<P>
   If working-class Americans think they should be doing better,
where do they go to improve their lot? Despite its imperfections,
America is the last best hope for individuals seeking to fulfill
their economic, political and spiritual potential. The reason is
simple. It's called personal liberty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a market economy operating in the context of a
reasonably liberal political system makes unequal distribution of
resources inevitable. The freedom of movement ensures that those
with more money, superior smarts or better connections will fare
better than those without.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't imply, however, that the relatively disadvantaged
in this regard can't make a good life for themselves. They can,
because the freedom that works for the better off works for them,
too.
</P>
<P>
   So let's quit bellyaching and get back to work.

BECAUSE OF KINDERGARTEN LESSON, EVOLUTION IS AT ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ The debate over evolution proves that some
things never change.
</P>
<P>
   Since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859,
scientists and those who read the Bible literally have argued over
how life came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of a lesson in a kindergarten class, the teaching
of evolution has become a front-burner topic in Lawrence, and an
issue in a school board race.
</P>
<P>
   It started when Ellen and Joel Barber found out that their
kindergartner was learning about evolution, the theory that all
life forms had a common beginning and changed over time as they
adapted to their environments.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbers formed a parents group called POSH, or Parents for
Objective Science and History. POSH wants schools to present
arguments against evolution as well. It also wants children to
learn alternative theories, such as the idea that the world and its
living creatures came about by ``intelligent design.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, another group entered the fray: FLAT, or Families for
Learning Accurate Theories. FLAT, heavily populated by University
of Kansas faculty, facetiously says POSH is wrong to focus only on
evolution and suggests that the Earth is flat because the Bible
says so.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is Jack Davidson, one of seven candidates for four
school board seats that will be decided at Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's answer at a candidate forum on whether he supports
teaching evolution as fact or theory has evolution opponents
posting yard signs and his colleagues at KU scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   During the forum, Ellen Barber asked candidates where they
stood. Davidson, a professor emeritus of physics, said he would
oppose teaching evolution as fact.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, he said later, science holds no truths.
Evolution is a theory, and a theory is a consensus of thinking on a
subject. It's a structure on which to hang proven facts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a starting point because the creationists
believe the biblical ideas are just as well-proved as Darwin's
evolutionary theories are,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say evolution is the common thread running through
the life sciences. The National Academy of Sciences said last year
that evolution must be taught in public schools if children are to
understand biology.
</P>
<P>
   And the courts have agreed, striking down laws that mandated
presenting evolution on an equal footing with stories of how God
created the universe.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate has continued.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 nationwide survey by the American Museum of Natural
History, 46 percent of 1,255 adults did not accept the theory that
humans evolved from earlier species of animals. Thirty-five percent
of the respondents believed humans and dinosaurs co-existed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, hundreds of people packed hearings around
Kansas to protest the state's new science curriculum standards. The
standards name evolution as a ``unifying concept'' in biology that
students must understand, despite their spiritual beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The standards will be presented in May to the Kansas Board of
Education, which has several members who have publicly questioned
evolution's validity.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to write curriculum standards across the country have
increased public awareness of the teaching of evolution, said
Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science Education in
Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of how life came to be don't have much relevance for
the average person, she said. ``What's settled among scientists
doesn't mean it's part of public awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Barber sees the debate differently. She believes people
are coming to understand that evolution is a theory with many gaps
that can't be explained.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching evolution as fact is ``not fair,'' she said. ``That's
not what we teach at home. That's not what we believe.''
</P>
<P>
   POSH has about 40 members, Barber said. Most are parents with
children in the Lawrence schools. Although the group sent a letter
to the Lawrence school board asking for equal time, POSH members
quickly realized they could be most effective by supporting school
board candidates sympathetic to their views, Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Davidson, POSH has identified two candidates _
Jeffrey Morrow and Carmela Sibley _ who have said they agree that
evolution should be taught as a theory. They haven't said they
advocate teaching alternate theories, Barber said, but it's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates are Cille King, Mary Loveland, Scott Morgan
and Sue Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   After Barber began asking candidates their views on teaching
evolution, Leonard Krishtalka, director of the Natural History
Museum and the Biodiversity Research Center at KU, wrote a column
in the Lawrence Journal-World describing creationism as false
science. A lively debate ensued in letters to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   Then FLAT was born.
</P>
<P>
   If the creation story in Genesis is to be taken literally, so
should other parts of the Bible, said FLAT spokesman Adrian Melott,
a KU physics professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek honesty, completeness and accuracy in the teaching of
all subjects in our public schools in place of the inaccurate,
faddish, non-Bible-based ideas that are currently being fed to our
children,'' Melott said this week in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The book of Revelation, for example, describes the Earth as
having four corners. Yet the fact that the Earth is round is freely
taught in Lawrence public schools, Melott said.
</P>
<P>
   FLAT hasn't announced which candidates it supports.
</P>
<P>
   Barber said she believes FLAT's positions reveal a bias in the
scientific community against Christians who believe Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Krishtalka said accepting evolution shouldn't prohibit
Christians from drawing meaning from the creation story in Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the stewards of life on Earth,'' Krishtalka said,
describing his interpretation of the creation story. ``It's a
wonderful piece of poetry. It's a lousy piece of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said some of his KU colleagues were making fun of those
who don't agree with their views. He said he believes school board
members should be role models and shouldn't poke fun at parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculing ideas you don't believe in only makes people
angry,'' Davidson said. ``People we teach must understand that our
point of view is based on a certain way of looking at the world.''

U.S. RELIEF ORGANIZATION HELPING BALKAN REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ The flier begins with this direct plea:
``Urgent S.O.S. _ Kosovo in need.''
</P>
<P>
   In January _ well before NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia and
the forced exodus of ethnic Albanians from their native Kosovo _ a
nonprofit Kansas City, Kan., organization mailed that flier to its
1,000 members in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   North American Croatian Relief Inc. was looking for food,
clothing, bottled water, toiletries _ anything that might help the
refugees who had left or soon would be fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Now packed inside the former St. Mary's Catholic
Church are thousands of boxes. Most of them bear hastily scrawled
labels, in Croatian and English, indicating the contents: clothes
for men, women and children; bedding; nonperishable food.
</P>
<P>
   These days one usually can find volunteers packing and labeling
the boxes inside the church's dimly lighted and pewless sanctuary.
Every day the pile grows, now measuring some 60 by 30 feet. The
boxes spill onto the altar and, in places, reach as high as 9 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In two to three weeks, if all goes well, as many as four semis
will pick up the boxes for the first leg of the long journey to
Albania, one of Europe's poorest countries. More than 100,000
Kosovar refugees have entered the country, creating what the United
Nations calls a ``major humanitarian emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the boxes must wait until Croatian Relief
raises $20,000 to $30,000 to cover shipping costs. So far, the
organization has collected about $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this drive, we had no idea it would come to
this point,'' said Bob Soptic, president of North American Croatian
Relief.
</P>
<P>
   Soptic, high school counselor of Croatian descent, was referring
not only to the unfathomable generosity spread before him but also
to the equally unfathomable number of ethnic Albanians forced to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Soptic, of Roeland Park, Kan., said Croatian Relief held five
fund-raisers each year and two drives to collect goods to assist
refugees in the Balkan region. The push to help Kosovar refugees is
taking place during what would normally be this year's first drive.
</P>
<P>
   From February into early March, the donations came in at a
steady pace. Then, as speculation increased that a NATO attack
could lead to more refugees, the pace of donations picked up. Now,
St. Mary's sanctuary is nearly full.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other area organization, Heart to Heart
International of Olathe, has been soliciting help for Kosovar
refugees. But Croatian Relief is unique because its sole mission is
to provide ongoing assistance to people displaced by the conflicts
in the Balkans, regardless of their national or ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was founded in the early 1990s by members and
associates of St. John the Baptist Catholic Church. It is about a
block from St. Mary's; both sit atop Strawberry Hill, a Croatian
neighborhood in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Many Croatian Relief members are first- and second-generation
Croatians whose ancestors built the church at the turn of the
century. When they began hearing reports of displaced Croats in
letters from distraught Croatian relatives, they were moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had to be done,'' said Soptic, who grew up in St.
John the Baptist parish but now is a member of another Catholic
church. ``We had to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the organization focused only on Balkan children.
Then in 1993, the parish sent its new pastor, the Rev. Frank
Horvat, to Croatia to see how the church could help. What Horvat
saw astonished him: Entire towns and cities destroyed. Cemeteries
plowed over. Babies and elderly people in orphanages and refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   After Horvat's visit, the organization's members decided to
provide relief to refugees of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Croatian Relief has members from 17 states, including
Missouri. Soptic estimates that over the years the organization has
sent more than 900,000 pounds of commodities to the Balkans, trying
to ship goods to where the need is most urgent.
</P>
<P>
   To help assess that need, the organization relies on Boris
Stancic, who emigrated from Yugoslavia to the United States in
1969. Stancic, a board vice president, keeps in touch with the
Croatian Red Cross, Croatian Catholic Charities and Croatian
bishops, priests and nuns. He has made four trips to Croatia since
1992 and has witnessed the same scenes of desperation that Horvat
saw.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Horvat, Stancic, of Kansas City, Mo., is able to draw
from personal experience to make sense of what he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, at the age of 17, Stancic experienced life without home
and country himself. Dissatisfied with his life under Yugoslavia's
then-Communist regime, he fled to Italy, where he and several
hundred other Hungarians and Yugoslavs lived in a former Nazi work
camp. Three months after Stancic arrived, the Italian government,
giving no reason, sent Stancic and several others back to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Stancic was jailed after Yugoslav forces caught
him and two companions trying to cross the Italian border. A decade
later, Yugoslavia relaxed its borders, and Stancic and his family
came to Kansas City, Kan., where his brother had been living for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal,'' Stancic said of his struggle to find a
permanent home. ``If you move to another country, you have to look
for a roof above your head, and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, inside St. Mary's sanctuary, Stancic motioned to the
thousands of boxes before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That right here,'' he said in his thick Croatian accent, ``is
love.''

 &HT;    THE DEATH OF PEC: HOW THE SERBS BESIEGED AND EMPTIED A KOSOVAR
CITY
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROZAJE, Montenegro, Yugoslavia First came the uneasy delight at
the news that NATO warplanes were striking their enemy, the Serbs.
Hours later came the terror of growling tanks through their streets
and gunfire echoing from house to house.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the sorrowful mass exodus as thousands of
ethnic Albanians from the Kosovo city of Pec an hour drive from
this border hamlet were ordered out of their homes and out of their
country by hundreds of well-armed Serb security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Families were separated. Young men disappeared and were presumed
to be executed. Lifelong memories and treasured possessions were
left behind as the people of Pec were made refugees.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Sunday, a caravan of cars, buses and trucks, scores
of them with police behind the wheels, carried the refugees north
toward the border with Montenegro. Behind them, parts of their city
were smoldering and in ruins at the hands of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the five days that followed the start on March 24 of U.S.-led
air strikes against Yugoslavia, Serb security forces had expelled
or executed most of Albanian population of Pec (pronounced Pesch),
refugees said. By the middle of last week, NATO satellite and spy
plane imagery confirmed that the city and surrounding villages of
180,000 were virtually deserted and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo have streamed through
the border town of Rozaje, in the neighboring republic of
Montenegro. In interviews, two dozen refugees offered accounts _
all impossible to independently verify _ of the dismantling of Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Some blamed the Yugoslav army and Serb police. Others spoke of
paramilitary troops and thugs in ski masks and black gloves.
</P>
<P>
   All agree that only hours after the NATO attacks began March 24,
Serb forces backed by army tanks and armored vehicles began a
systematic sweep of the city to expel the ethnic Albanians and
destroy their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some men were arrested and are now presumed dead. Many families
were robbed of their money and valuables.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians were forced from their homes and eventually
across the border to Montenegro, Albania or Macedonia, part of an
estimated 300,000 Kosovars that have fled bloodshed and anarchy
inside their own borders since NATO air strikes began.
</P>
<P>
   For Enver Kelmenoj, 26, an apprentice electrician, the fear
began even before U.S. and NATO warplanes left their bases. He was
awake at 11:30 on the Tuesday night before the air campaign began,
listening to a Voice of America radio report that NATO strikes on
Serb targets were imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Like most ethnic Albanians in the besieged Kosovo province, we
was elated that NATO was soon to be in action. ``But we knew what
that meant. We knew we would have to go,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The following night, March 24, Lumtunje Arifaj, needed no radio
to tell her the air strikes had begun. The 23-year-old lived in a
house in Pec near the Yugoslav Army barracks. She heard the tanks
and armored cars rumble to a start and pull out of the gate late
that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bah-boom, all night this was the music,'' she recalled. ``We
are near the military barracks and we heard the tanks going out and
some voices in Serbian saying, 'Faster, faster, speed up,' telling
each other to hurry. They were firing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the city, Kelmenoj listened at the window
from his darkened bedroom. ``We could hear the soldiers firing
their guns and singing their army songs, like they were
celebrating,'' he recalled. ``I heard a burst of automatic fire and
then them singing, 'Kosovo is Ours.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Serb offensive intensified and most ethnic
Albanians were huddled in their homes, listening to increasingly
frequent explosions and gunfire resounding outside. Those with
cellars hid there. Electricity was cut and the phones went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Columns of thick, black smoke rose over the city as houses
blazed. People saw soldiers firing into structures and buildings
crumbling as tank rounds slammed into them.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Serb forces had been running raids in the villages
surrounding Pec, trying to root out the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) and halt their hit-and-run guerrilla war. Many residents of
Pec had believed they were off limits, that the war would not reach
the commercial center of western Kosovo, which had a small Serb
minority.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, those illusions had disappeared for Isa Ramea, 49, a
metal worker. His cellar was occupied with his wife and three
daughters and five other families, ``35 people in all,'' cowering
in the bowels of his house near an historic monastery in the
western outskirts of Pec. Earlier he had seen some blocks of houses
flattened by tanks or artillery. Three tanks and about
</P>
<P>
   50 troops moved down his street. ``This part of the city was
surrounded by paramilitary and police. We couldn't move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They lived on bread and cucumbers and shared two candles between
them for light. They could hear footsteps above as police searched
the house and took belongings. Eventually, their candles and their
luck ran out. The security forces discovered them and forced them
to began the march to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Deme Kosova, 65, considers himself a Yugoslavian first, a
Kosovar Albanian second. When U.S.-brokered peace talks failed to
reach a settlement on Kosovo, his wife told him they should leave.
When NATO air attacks began, she told him again. He told her time
and again that Pec was their home and they would be safe. But after
watching his city smolder for several days, he
</P>
<P>
   finally began to take notice when Serbian neighbors in his
apartment block, worried about his safety, suggested that it was
time for him to go. The following day, Sunday, they would leave in
what would be an organized expulsion of thousands from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs and Albanians, we all got along together when I was a
child ... The tragic loss is that I lost my trust. I lost my
illusions that in the end there would be unity as Yugoslavians,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, March 28, was departure day for thousands from Pec. The
security forces assembled scores of buses, trucks and cars along
the broad promenade in the city center and herded much of the
population there.
</P>
<P>
   From his apartment building, Kosova did not wait for the police
to come to him. At 11 a.m., he could see from his apartment the
exodus: ``I told my wife that we cannot wait for the police to come
because if we wait for them to come they may kill us here. So we
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, 14-year-old Drilon Zeka and his little brother,
Qendrim, 9, ran into the woods near their house after their uncle
told them Serb troops were heading down the street. They found a
shed in which to hide. Hearing rumors of previous Serb atrocities,
Drilon feared the troops would kill his little brother. With the
help of a couple of young men also in the shed, they
</P>
<P>
   wedged the little boy between two piles of wood. They didn't
remain concealed for long. Serbian police found them and arrested
the two men. Drilon and his brother were herded along with others
to the center of town and the forced evacuation to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Sunday, most of the city was on the move,
some on foot but most driven to the border of Montenegro, where
they made their way to the grimy truck-stop town of Rozaje, on a
mountain pass near Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Undiscovered, Zoje Kastrati, 31, her husband Mehmat, a farm
hand, and their two young sons, remained in their home in Pec,
apparently in one of the last neighborhoods to be reached in the
terrifying sweep. Since the NATO air strikes began, they took in
five other families, covered the windows with heavy blankets and
attempted to remain as quiet as possible for the next five
</P>
<P>
   days in hopes that their house would not be entered. Ironically,
their four-story home was near the city center where most of the
population was being herded the day before.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, armed men, some uniformed and others in civilian
clothing, entered the house and demanded that the family leave.
They claimed to be part of a militia and they dragged Mehmat down
the stairs, claiming he was with the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that I would never see him again because they would
kill him or take him away forever,'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   After a check of his documents, they released him, but demanded
money and jewelry. The family said they gave the forces about
$1,700 and jewelry in return for a promise that they and their
family and friends could remain in the house for another three
days.
</P>
<P>
   The promise lasted only until Wednesday, when they were forced
out by security forces. They walked over the border on foot.
</P>
<P>
   She had given up the family's fortune in vain, hoping to buy
three more days in Pec. Perhaps the siege would end. Perhaps NATO's
air war would prevail. Perhaps peace talks would resume. Kastrati
said: ``We hoped something would happen that would allow us to stay
forever there.''

HO HUM: NEW YORK, CANADA MAKE TRANSITION TO YEAR 2000 WITHOUT
HITCHES

   UNDATED: Another critical Y2K date. Another day of ho's and
hum's...no news is good news...yawn...let's load up Quake on the
Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the only fool on April 1 was the man in the sandwich
board proclaiming digital doom. New York, the first state to face a
Y2K fiscal year test, made the transition to the Year 2000 without
a hitch. Up north, the Canadians did the same, as that country
moved into the 2000 fiscal year unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on this since April 1996, so having this
confirmation is still gratifying,'' said Gary Davis, Year 2000
project manager for New York. ``It is an important date, but Jan. 1
is still the real test.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 Project Office for Canada's Treasury Board
Secretariat also reported no problems with government computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's been a nonevent,'' said Jim Bimson of the Year
2000 office.
</P>
<P>
   The New York and Canada switchovers weren't the only good news
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines did an airborne Year 2000 communications
test on Thursday. It tested the air-to-ground data link
communications system, and airline officials said the
first-of-its-kind test went off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This demonstration flight shows that we can achieve
consistent, reliable air-to-ground communications through and
beyond the millennium clock rollover,'' said Janet Wejman,
Continental's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys and polls continue to drive home the message of calm in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the federal government reported that 92 percent of
its 6,123 crucial computer systems met President Clinton's March 31
deadline for making ``mission critical'' computers ready for the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But, reported the Associated Press, it was more than hard work
and No-Doz that got the job done. An analysis showed that some
agencies merely redefined what it means to be ``mission citical''
and boosted their completion percentage.
</P>
<P>
   At the Department of Defense, for example, the number of mission
critical systems went from 3,695 to 2,581, boosting the completion
percentage from 18 percent to 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And although the numbers are generally considered a positive
sign of progress, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Texas
Republican, criticized the report, saying the administration ``is
fooling itself and luring the American public into a false sense of
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Wednesday federal and Thursday New York state
deadlines are the latest in a series of critical Y2K dates that
have passed with few or no problems.
</P>
<P>
   The New York changeover happened as Ziff-Davis, a media firm
that publishes computer magazines and produces TV programs
dedicated to technology, stood by.
</P>
<P>
   ``...When the computers continued to function and the state's
director of information technology said `Nothing happened,' there
was a distinct air of disappointment in the control room at the
television studio,'' writes Mitch Ratcliffe on the {www.zdy2k.com}
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Y2K, and the reason that the growing litany
of successes are not being reported is that a successful
remediation program makes a boring headline.''
</P>
<P>
   It also isn't good for the survivalist industry. Equipping those
who believe Jan. 1, 2000, computer chaos will make the world a
dangerous place has become a big business on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Did all the good Y2K news this week quiet the barking dogs who
say TEOTWAWKI _ The End Of The World As We Know It _ is on its way?
Nope. They're still baying at the moon of doom and gloom _ although
they've had to change their strategy a bit.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web at www.y2knewswire.com, a ``news service'' run by a
survivalist supply company, the headline Friday morning read:
``4/2/1999 _ Threat of war now rising//Y2K impact unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   After diligently reporting that New York and Canada had no
problems Thursday, Y2K Newswire switched strategy and suggested the
possibility of war between the United States and Russia over
Kosovo. Stock up now.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the site links readers to Y2K Supply, another
Web site owned by the same company, an Oregon marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the bad news...
</P>
<P>
   PLD Telekom Inc., a New York-based company that provides phone
services in the former Soviet Union, said its operations could be
hurt because the Yugoslavian crisis has prompted the Russian
government to limit its efforts to fix the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   PLD told the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Russian
government recently said it intended to limit its cooperation with
companies that are fixing the Year 2000 computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   PLD, which provides local, long-distance and cellular services,
said there is ``significant risk'' that the company's operations
may be disrupted because its customers and partners won't be able
to complete phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   PLD also said Y2K readiness in Russia is ``substantially
behind'' that of Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   Have code, will travel
</P>
<P>
   Elewhere on the global front, the International Y2K Cooperation
Center in Washington is holding a press conference Tuesday to
announce the launch of its ``YES'' force, a cadre of Y2K Expert
Services.

<P>
   Sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, the center
hopes to attract a volunteer force of computer experts to travel to
far-off places and fix faulty code.

MISSOURI BANNED CONCEALED WEAPONS IN 1800S TO APPEAR MORE
CIVILIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For years Jesse James and his gang terrorized
Missouri, firing their guns without remorse as they robbed banks,
trains and homes.
</P>
<P>
   They were fired upon, too, as Union soldiers, vigilantes, lawmen
and ordinary citizens in pursuit turned to their guns for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Pinkerton agents bombed James' farmhouse in Clay
County in 1875, killing the outlaw's half brother and maiming his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri lawmakers, convinced that this escalation of violence
was hurting the state's image, outlawed concealed weapons several
months later.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Missouri voters will decide whether to make
concealed firearms legal again. If Proposition B passes, Missouri
will join 43 states that allow some form of concealed firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Few states, however, match the heritage of conflict and violence
in Missouri, home of James and site of the Union Station Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's 1875 concealed-weapons measure was born, in part, out
of the embarrassment of Democratic state officials. The state's
inability to stop James and his colleagues from preying on rail
traffic was providing campaign fodder for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The concealed-weapons provision, part of a new constitution
pounded out over 74 days in 1875, was an effort to persuade those
outside Missouri of the state's regard for law, said Dick Steward,
social sciences professor at Lincoln University in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that would attract new settlers and new investments
was seen as a positive step,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the law also was designed to keep weapons out of the hands
of people that some legislators deemed untrustworthy, such as freed
slaves, said Tom Carroll, associate professor of sociology and
criminology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Missouri having been a slaveholding state, with a large
number of freed ex-slaves, there were considerable fears that the
weapons might be used for what the legislators considered nefarious
purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest days of the Missouri territory, the problem was
not too many guns but too few.
</P>
<P>
   A 1792 federal law mandated that, in all states and territories,
male residents ages 18 to 45 maintain a personal military
preparedness. That included reporting to occasional militia musters
for drilling.
</P>
<P>
   It also included owning a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Missouri's men felt that an intrusion. Some even mocked
the law, showing up for musters with rakes, poles and cornstalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Average, ordinary working men just didn't like to be bothered
with state or federal regulations,'' said Mary Ellen Rowe,
associate professor of history at Central Missouri State University
in Warrensburg.
</P>
<P>
   One reason was the expense. ``If you are talking about a day
laborer in St. Louis, you are talking about six months' wages just
to provide yourself with a halfway decent musket, plus powder and
lead,'' Rowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes prevailed even in wartime. In the War of 1812 the
Missouri territorial governor complained that only about a quarter
of Missouri militia members were battle-ready. That was despite a
decision in 1807 by the federal government to dole out old Army
surplus weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent years before statehood in 1821, though,
territorial authorities near St. Louis began confiscating weapons
that possibly had been stolen from federal arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1836 the city of St. Louis passed an ordinance against
concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom was that getting concealed weapons out
of the hands of ordinary citizens was a step toward demonstrating
Missouri's more civilized nature,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   This was necessary, in part, because of Missouri's taste for
dueling in the decades before the Civil War. Among states west of
the Mississippi River, only Louisiana has served as the site of
more duels, said Steward.
</P>
<P>
   A sandbar in the Mississippi River came to be called Bloody
Island, after about 40 duels were staged there in full view of St.
Louis spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would line up on the shore and watch,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   Dueling was especially popular in St. Louis, where many doctors,
lawyers and professionals had brought with them their fascination
with the dueling code upon migrating from the South, Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City gun owners, meanwhile, were not nearly so civilized.
The brutal guerrilla warfare that raged before and during the Civil
War was so pitiless that ``even hardened prostitutes stayed away''
from this area, writes Kansas City historian Lawrence Larsen in an
upcoming encyclopedia on violence in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the end of the Civil War ushered in the outlaw era.
</P>
<P>
   Just one month after the war ended, ``Wild'' Bill Hickok gunned
down an outlaw next to the courthouse steps in Springfield. The
next year, in 1866, a bold gang of bandits thought to have included
Jesse James stunned residents of Liberty by robbing a bank in
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1875 lawmakers hoping to curb violence in the state made
concealed weapons illegal. But those hoping for a more civilized
20th century in Missouri would be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City streets under the management of the Thomas
Pendergast machine, which flourished in the late 1920s and
throughout the 1930s, often proved just as dangerous as during the
city's frontier days.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Mayerberg, a Kansas City religious leader who spoke out
against the machine, survived an assassination attempt in the early
1930s. Four persons died of gunshot wounds at polls in the 1934
municipal elections. MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ 1934 municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   But of all such outrages, the most far-reaching would be the
June 1933 Union Station Massacre in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Many know how four law officers, along with fugitive Frank Nash,
died in an exchange of gunfire just outside the station. Less
well-known, according to author Bob Unger, was how the massacre was
sparked by a panicking federal agent discharging a shotgun he was
unschooled in operating. With two shots he killed Nash and two
fellow lawmen.
</P>
<P>
   The agent was not even supposed to be armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``By law, agents were not supposed to carry guns except under
the most extreme conditions,'' said Unger, author of The Union
Station Massacre. ``But the reality was that whenever they felt
threatened, they carried all the weapons they could get their hands
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Within about a year of the massacre, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt had signed nine anti-crime bills into law, creating a new
federal code. One change allowed federal agents to use and carry
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But J. Edgar Hoover (who became FBI director) didn't wait for
that,'' Unger said. ``He shipped machine guns to agents in Kansas
City in about three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite violent incidents such as the massacre, random violence
was not common, said Bill Gilmer, a Kansas City police officer from
1939 to 1969. Gilmer said few people thought to carry guns for
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They respected law enforcement for having weapons and being
there to take care of them,'' said Gilmer, who wrote Glory Be to
St. John, a history of the Police Department. ``There was a deep
respect of guns and what they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the most visible violence shifted from
political thuggery to random crime, said Gilmer, the last officer
Pendergast appointed. Gradually, people became more open to guns,
he said. Still, it has only been in the last two decades that the
gun culture has become more prevalent. Ironically, Gilmer said,
law-enforcement technology has advanced, giving police greater
weapons against criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think people feel as safe as they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in an era of falling crime rates, it's still the
perception of widespread lawlessness that is fueling support for
Proposition B.

 &HT;    Reds `armed and dangerous'
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ No matter what venue the Cincinnati Reds visited
for exhibition games this season, or no matter what team came to Ed
Smith Stadium in gorgeous Sarasota, the reaction was the same.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts, general managers and baseball officials scanned the
roster, looked up at the team wearing their spring-training black
hats, and said, ``Amazing. This was put together with a payroll
just over $34million. You can say what you want, but general
manager Jim Bowden did a wondrous job over the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1995, there was reason to go to Florida
for something other than sunshine and palm trees. For the first
time since 1995, the Cincinnati Reds appear ready to compete for a
National League Central championship.
</P>
<P>
   General managers said it. Field managers said it. Baseball
officials said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is dangerous and easily could win the division,''
they said.
</P>
<P>
   And they are right.
</P>
<P>
   A team with a suspect starting rotation added left-hander Denny
Neagle, left-hander Steve Avery and right-hander Jason Bere to go
along with proven winners Pete Harnisch and Brett Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   If any of those five slip, right-hander Steve Parris and
left-hander Dennys Reyes proved last year they are more than
trinkets. They easily can be plugged into the rotation without it
being catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   A team with no visible power outlet added Greg Vaughn _ one of
only four players to hit 50 or more home runs last year. Vaughn
also had 119 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   A team with no accomplished center fielder added Mike Cameron,
who kept Mark McGwire from hitting 71 home runs last year by
leaping above the Comiskey Park right-center wall to snag McGwire's
bid for yet another home run.
</P>
<P>
   A team with no bench last year added seasoned and proven
veterans like Hal Morris, Mark Sweeney, Mark Lewis, Michael Tucker
and Brian Johnson. Add to that the veteran leadership of shortstop
Barry Larkin, and the Reds could be on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a very fun year for the Cincinnati Reds and a
not-so-fun year for other teams in the National League Central ...
in fact, the entire National League,'' said one NL scout. ``This
team is armed and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after last season had concluded, Bowden listed three
areas that needed to be addressed before the 1999 campaign began
and he put postage on each one _ the starting pitching, the bench,
defense in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we need to do this year is catch the ball,'' Harnisch
said. ``Play good, solid defense. We can't play so-so defense, we
have to be good. We have good pitching and we will score runs. If
we play defense, this team can be real, real good.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation began boldly.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden traded popular and productive second baseman Bret Boone,
along with left-handed pitcher Mike Remlinger, to the Atlanta
Braves for Neagle, Tucker and future rotation member Rob Bell, one
of Atlanta's top pitching prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, one of baseball's best defensive second basemen, had his
best offensive year, leading the team in home runs (24) and RBIs
(95). ``I love Bret Boone, as a player and as a person,'' Bowden
said. ``I hated to trade him, but when you have a chance to get the
players we got, especially a proven winning pitcher like Neagle,
you pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't shooting blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden next aimed his semi-automatic at the center fielder and
his ardor for Cameron became a mission. The Chicago White Sox
wanted Paul Konerko, a player with potential unfulfilled and not a
part of the plans in Cinergy Field. Konerko went for Cameron and
another hole was plugged.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the team was better ... but still not a
contender. Power was missing. Bowden had been trying to trade
injury-prone Reggie Sanders for nearly two years, but could find no
takers.
</P>
<P>
   Then his telephone rang in January. It was from San Diego
general manager Kevin Towers and if Bowden had known beforehand
what Towers wanted, he would have accepted a collect call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you take Greg Vaughn for Reggie Sanders?'' Towers asked.
``And, oh yeah, we'll throw in Mark Sweeney if you'll include
Damian Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden sputtered ``yes,'' and pinched himself to awake from his
dream. It was no dream. For two players Bowden didn't want, he
received two he really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes and called a press conference within the hour
before Towers changed his mind,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, most of the pieces were there.
</P>
<P>
   And not only will the team barely be recognizable because of new
faces, some of those faces will be adorned by facial hair for the
first time since 1967 and the team will be wearing new uniforms
with black trim added to the traditional red.
</P>
<P>
   For once, too, the Reds have a chance at returning to a long-ago
tradition ... winning.

MACEDONIA CLOSES BORDER TO KOSOVO REFUGEES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ This Balkan nation shut its borders on the
11th day of NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia Saturday, stranding some
55,000 refugees in a massive, muddy field where nearly a dozen
elderly ethnic Albanians and newborn infants have already died.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which marked the first border closing by a
neighboring Kosovo, alarmed Western officials still grappling to
get a handle on the refugee crisis, and heightened concerns that
governmental instability could spread.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kosovars continued to flee the province by the thousands,
NATO warplanes bombed downtown Belgrade for a second day, and
officials repeated their threat to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that ``no target is off-limits.'' President Clinton also
expressed his resolve, saying the United States must ``stand with
all our NATO allies to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation cannot do everything. We can't stop all the
violence. But there are times when looking away simply is not an
option,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not address a report that US officials were
considering taking in some of the ethnic Albanian refugees. German
officials announced Saturday they would open their doors to the
displaced, and encouraged other countries to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana also addressed the refugee
tragedy, suggesting alliance forces might be able to return ethnic
Albanians to their homes in Kosovo even if Yugoslavia did not agree
to a peace treaty. Although the plan would mean placing ground
troops in hostile Serb territory, Solana described the potential
mission as one designed to allow Kosovars to return home, not as an
effort to wage war on the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the BBC began airing footage of what it said
were sites of mass murder, showing the bodies of what were believed
to be ethnic Albanian men. British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said in a BBC interview that ``they were killed for one reason
only: they were of the wrong ethnic identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the edges of Kosovo, aid workers rushing to lend
assistance faced some of their greatest geographic and logistical
hurdles Saturday, as NATO officials estimated some 290,000 ethnic
Albanians had fled since airstrikes began March 24, and another
300,000 were on their way.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, the number of Kosovar refugees Saturday reached an
estimated 170,000, creating an enormous crisis for the poorest
nation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the ethnic Albanians flooding the northern
border, Albanian officials have been deploying buses and trucks to
move people south toward the capital, Tirana. But the pace of the
influx, combined with the country's delapidated and winding
mountain roads, has made it difficult for officials to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare situation,'' President Rexhep Meidani said.
</P>
<P>
   Meidani, along with leaders of several aid organizations, held
out hope that neighboring Macedonia would reopen its borders to the
refugees, most of whom say they were stripped of their
identification and driven from their homes in Kosovo by Serb
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, a poor nation of 2 million residents, has already
taken in approximately 115,000 ethnic Albanians since NATO
airstrikes began and Milosevic began stepping up his campaign of
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   US and Western allies were rushing to send some 200 tents, 8,000
sleeping bags and 1,500 beds to Macedonia, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said their forces would also step in to help.
General Mike Jackson, the British commander of 11,000 NATO troops
in Macedonia, was Saturday given authority to direct soldiers to
provide assistance in the refugee crisis. NATO officials also plan
to send 6,000 troops to Albania. There were no immediate plans to
send US or NATO military assistance to Montenegro, which is still a
part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and where some 32,000
ethnic Albanians have fled in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In Blace, Macedonia, the human misery had only worsened
overnight. Overnight rain reduced to a swamp the huge valley field
where up to 50,000 refugees were waiting to be allowed in. Several
were reported to have died waiting to leave the field. The crying
of children pierced the air. Scuffles broke out as hungry,
exhausted refugees clashed with police who held them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unbelievable scene,'' said US Major Henry Cate, a
NATO spokesman in Blace. ``We are going to try to help these people
as best we can. But it is a monumental undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the population of Kosovo continued to empty out, NATO
and Pentagon officials indicated increasing success in the air
campaign against Milosevic, saying that on Friday they had struck a
complex of military headquarters in downtown Belgrade and set them
on fire. Serb television also reported Saturday that a second
bridge had been hit in the major city of Novi Sad, two days after
NATO missiles destroyed a bridge over the Danube River, blocking
the major commercial route.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, NATO forces continued to rely on sea-launched Tomahawk
missiles, which can function despite the bad weather conditions
that have clung to the region for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Defense specialists had begun to worry that the supply of
Tomahawks was running low. But Pentagon officials confirmed
Saturday that the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt has been
authorized to take part in the airstrikes, instead of being sent to
the Persian Gulf for its scheduled duty near Iraq. The USS Theodore
Roosevelt, equipped with some 75 warplanes and a number of cruise
missiles, is scheduled to arrive in the Adriatic Sea Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just inside the Kosovo-Macedonia border, tens of
thousands of others waited in squalor for the chance to enter a
country that has said it will only accept refugees bound for
someplace else. Some NATO officials said they were shocked not only
at the lack of official response but also at the disorganization of
humanitarian agencies dispatched to fix the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said it ``is a tragic situation and we
are trying our best to handle it.'' But the Macedonian government,
she said, ``is understandably frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the few signs of encouragement was a sudden halt to the
trains from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, which Serb authorities
had been using to transport ethnic Albanians out of town. Refugees
claimed Pristina had been emptied out, saying hundreds of thousands
of other refugees were waiting to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly further east, the commander of the three American
soldiers who were captured on Wednesday by Yugoslav forces said he
had temporarily suspended patrols in the area where his men were
seized.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe, Lieutenant Colonel James Shufelt
said the situation in the border area northeast of Kumanovo,
populated by ethnic Serbs who oppose the bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia and who have repeatedly threatened US scouts patrolling
the area, had become ``untenable.''

ARMY BELIEVES THREE SOLDIERS TAKEN WITHIN MACEDONIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETROVAC, Macedonia _ Staff Sergeant Chris Stone's voice was so
flat, so unemotional, that when he radioed for help Wednesday, his
superior officer, Sergeant First Class Jim LaShelle, didn't think
he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, LaShelle's skepticism inadvertently cut Stone
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grid 675. . .'' Stone said, before LaShelle broke in on the
radio line to make sure Stone wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only half of a six-digit number needed to locate
Stone and two other soldiers whose Humvee had been surrounded by
Serbs on Wednesday. His colleagues had a general location, but not
an exact one. When Stone repeated that they were taking direct
fire, LaShelle knew it was true and bolted up straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plow through 'em!'' LaShelle yelled. ``Plow through 'em!''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Stone heard him, or whether they could have been saved
even if Stone had not been cut off, is still unclear. The radio
went dead, and most of Stone's comrades in the 1st Squadron of the
4th US Cavalry assumed Stone, Staff Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez, and
Specialist Steven M. Gonzales were dead, too.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 hours later, pictures of the soldiers, bruised and
sullen, turned up on Serbian television, abruptly ending what had
been a desperate search for them in rugged, hostile terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with those who were out patrolling with the three US
soldiers suggest they were on a routine but inherently dangerous
mission, skirting the border with a paranoid country that may have
been convinced that US troops were preparing to invade.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers' colleagues insist that their comrades were too
experienced and knew the frontier too well to have strayed
inadvertently into enemy territory. They said they believe the
three were victims of edgy Serb forces and an unmarked, disputed
border.
</P>
<P>
   According to the interviews, conducted Saturday at the home base
here of the 350 soldiers from the squadron to which the three
prisoners belong, the patrol made them vulnerable to anyone
determined to snatch them. And the capture has made them a
bargaining chip in President Slobodan Milosevic's showdown with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers of the US Cavalry pride themselves on being
flexible and adaptable. They are the successors of the Cavalry that
scouted the American frontier and that were depicted riding to the
rescue in Saturday matinees of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, they were part of a United Nations mission that kept
watch along Macedonia's border with Yugoslavia. While there were
twice as many troops from Nordic countries taking part, it was the
presence of the 350 Americans that made Milosevic hesitant to
encroach on the border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But the UN mission ended abruptly in February when China,
angered over Macedonia's recognition of Taiwan, and exercising its
veto as one of the UN's five Security Council members, refused to
renew the mission's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Cavalry could be sent back to its headquarters in
Germany, however, the situation in Kosovo deteriorated sharply. On
March 24, the day NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, the Cavalry
formally began scouting the border to protect 11,000 NATO troops
waiting in Macedonia to implement a peace plan in Kosovo. They
peeled off their blue UN patches and berets, and changed the paint
on their armored vehicles from UN white to standard Army green.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Colonel James Shufelt, the captured soldiers'
commanding officer, said the mission went from simple observation
to combat reconnaisance _ that is, surreptitiously looking for Serb
troop movements and locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a UN mission, you want to be seen,'' Shufelt said. ``Now
the tactical mission was not to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the bombing and heightened hostilities, the Americans were
theoretically in more danger than before. But the reconnaisance
missions in fact took them farther from, not closer to, the border,
so they should have been even less likely to encounter Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the border is unmarked, and there has been a long-running
dispute between Yugoslavia and Macedonia about its exact location.
Fed a steady diet of stories suggesting that US reluctance to
commit ground troops in Kosovo was an American trick, Yugoslav
forces moved closer to the border. The captured soldiers' comrades
are convinced that the Yugoslavs crossed the border to surround and
snatch them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Serb forces crossed the border and dug trenches in
Macedonian territory, in the area where the soldiers were taken,
according to Alexander Ivanofsky, a former Macedonian soldier.
Ivanofsky and other Macedonian soldiers dug their own trenches
about 70 yards away, but the standoff ended peacefully four days
later when the Serbs left as abruptly as they had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   While some in Congress have criticized the Army, saying the
captured soldiers should not have been allowed to patrol alone and
were too lightly armed, Shufelt said the criticism is fine in
hindsight, but does not take into account the operational demands
put on his troops.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 1st Infantry, the Cavalry is among the best-armed
fighting units in the Army. But their heavy equipment was left
behind at their German headquarters, deemed inappropriate for a UN
mission. Even if it had been decided it was needed for border
scouting to protect NATO troops, it is unlikely that it would have
made it here in time to avert the capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally would rather be in a tank or a Bradley,'' Shufelt
admitted, ``but the reality is you can scout from a motorcycle.
Would I prefer to have my heavy stuff? Yes. Could we do the job
with what we had? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The captured soldiers, Shufelt said, were part of a patrol that
included three Humvees. As a standard precaution, border scouts
establish what they call a ``rally point,'' to which they race if
there is a hint of danger. Once there, the patrol commander can
make sure everyone is accounted for, and take action if someone is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The rally point changes as the observation posts do. On Tuesday,
Lieutenant Wayne Mahoney found a new rally point, an isolated spot
between a group of villages northeast of Kumanovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he noticed an immediate rise in hostility once the
NATO bombing began and Cavalry vehicles reverted to their standard
Army green.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were UN, people waved at us,'' he said. ``When we went
to green, they started stoning us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the local residents were ethnic Serbs, Mahoney said
he had no reason to think they were capable of springing a trap or
tipping off Serb forces about the frequent US patrols. He believed
the rally point he picked out was isolated enough not to draw
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place was totally unthreatening,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was patrolling with Mahoney on Tuesday when the rally
point was selected, but Ramirez and Gonzales were not. While
Mahoney and those in the other two Humvees continued their patrol
Wednesday afternoon, Stone directed Ramirez to drive toward the
rally point so that Ramirez and Gonzales would know where it was.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, 24, from Los Angeles, had risen quickly in the Army and
was a career man. Stone, a Michigan native praised by his
colleagues as a meticulous student of reconnaisance, sat next to
Ramirez, using a hand-held global positioning system, which allowed
him to determine they were about 3 miles from the border. Gonzales,
21, a Texan, manned a .50-caliber Browning machine gun mounted on
top of the Humvee, his torso exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Shufelt and other officers said they believe the three soldiers
drove into either an ambush or a Serb unit that had set up a
heavily armed border patrol of its own.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a local postman, Slave Markovic, showed a Globe
reporter the unmarked dirt road he and other ethnic Serbs say the
US soldiers were driving on when they were captured. Macedonian TV
quoted residents of the Yugoslav village of Slavuevac as saying the
Americans had driven about a mile into Serbian territory before
they were captured. Markovic, 36, who said he had heard but had not
seen the shooting, added that he is convinced the Americans
unwittingly crossed the border.
</P>
<P>
   But the three soldiers' comrades vehemently dispute that, saying
they knew the border too well and had a positioning device with
them. Corporal Michael Fernicola, who did basic training with
Gonzales and is friendly with all three, said they were
conscientious soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergeant Stone would stay late to read maps, to make sure he
doesn't make mistakes. He knows that terrain. He wouldn't go off
course,'' Fernicola said.
</P>
<P>
   LaShelle, who was in charge of the three-vehicle patrol, was
even more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive they were not in Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``We had
been out there the day before. The landmarks are clearly
identifiable. They are very reliable people. I have complete faith
in their navigational ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the soldiers could have inadvertently crossed into
enemy territory, Shufelt, their commander, said, ``Is it possible?
Yes. Is it probable? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone is praised by fellow soldiers for being calm under
pressure. It was that coolness that momentarily fooled LaShelle
when the distress call came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergeant Stone's voice didn't seem right. That's why I asked
him if he was bullshitting,'' LaShelle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Four, this is Blue Five,'' Stone said. ``We're in
contact. We're taking direct fire.''
</P>
<P>
   About a mile away, LaShelle grabbed his radio, admonishing
Stone, saying, ``You better not be bullshitting me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not,'' Stone replied. ``We're taking direct fire. We're
trapped. They're all around us. We can't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, one of the nearby scouts set out on foot
to look for his comrades. It was an extremely dangerous operation,
snaking and sneaking through the farmland and rolling hills, armed
only with an M-16 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   LaShelle radioed that he was going to take his Humvee toward the
rally point to find them, but Captain Keith Igyarto, the troop
commander manning the radio back at base, ordered him not to,
fearing another ambush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing,'' LaShelle said in hindsight. ``I might have
driven right into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The captured soldiers' comrades presume they were heavily
outgunned, and the narrow dirt road made it impossible to turn and
escape.
</P>
<P>
   When Mahoney heard Stone's plea for help, ``I thought they got
shot. I thought they were hurt. I had a medic with us and I told
him to get the medical supplies ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney picked up an interpreter and began asking local
villagers if they had seen anything or heard shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they didn't know anything, or if they knew, they
weren't saying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant Jim Tighe, a Norwell native and 1997 Boston
College graduate, took a Blackhawk helicopter up to look for his
comrades. But by the time Tighe was overhead, the Humvee had
disappeared without a trace, presumably driven across enemy lines
by Yugoslav forces or sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   French, British and Italian pilots also looked for the missing
soldiers. After a frustrating, futile, all-night operation, the
search was called off suddenly when Brigadier General John Craddock
called Shufelt in the field and said, ``They've just been shown on
CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Shufelt, who had not slept in more than 24 hours, raced back to
base so he could see the pictures on TV. His soldiers looked like
they had been beaten up by their captors, but Shufelt was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the possibilities, I was just relieved to see they were
alive,'' he said. ``The challenge now is how to get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is what is frustrating Cavalry soldiers most. Stone,
Ramirez and Gonzales are now chips in a game of diplomacy. Swedish
diplomats have been thwarted in their attempts to see the soldiers.
The Serbs say they will put the soldiers on trial. President
Clinton says they are entitled to prisoner of war status under the
Geneva Convention and warns that Milosevic will pay a heavy price
if they are harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, for the first time since the bombing began, the scouts
of the US Cavalry did not go back to the area where their comrades
were captured. Shufelt called off the patrols there Friday night,
at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Wild West out there,'' Jim Shufelt said, shaking his
head.

MILOSOVIC PLANS TO DRIVE ALL ETHNIC ALBANIANS FROM KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never has it been clearer: Within three weeks, unless Slobodan
Milosevic has a sudden change of heart or unless NATO ground forces
abruptly move to intervene, Kosovo will be depopulated of almost
all its 1.8 million ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO air power alone may yet deter the Yugoslav president. Or
the alliance could dispatch troops into Kosovo, under the guise of
an international peacekeeping force to care for those Albanians he
can't rout.
</P>
<P>
   But splitting up Kosovo is still being publicly rejected by all
sides _ Serb, Albanian, even American. And if trends continue, a
NATO official indicated Saturday, a ``massive ethnic cleansing''
will be complete in the province by late this month.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Kosovo is on a path toward becoming a Serb-only
province _ the fulfillment of Serb nationalists' six-century dream
to retake their religious and ethnic heartland, a place so sacred
in Serbian history, religion, and myth that they romanticize it in
epic poetry.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House and European governments continued
Saturday to decry the persecution of ethnic Albanians, and launched
more waves of warplanes and cruise missiles to punish the Serbs,
NATO countries again indicated that they have no intention of
fighting their way into the province to stop the Albanian expulsion
or to protect displaced Albanians inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   British and US units are readied to go to the region to help
protect Kosovo refugees, a NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, announced
Saturday, but Milosevic would have to pull back his forces and give
his approval for them to enter Kosovo to set up havens. Whether
Milosevic will do that before he has cleared out most of the
Albanian population depends on whether he wants to endure more NATO
bombing so that he can pull off a historic transformation of Kosovo
_ and go down in Serb legend as the man who reversed the Kosovo
defeat of 1389 _ or whether he sees merit in cooperating (having
gotten most of what he wants) and bringing in international aid
both to help the remaining refugees and to rebuild the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO would have to move extremely quickly into the landlocked
province to stop the Serbs' aims. At the present rate of ``ethnic
cleansing,'' Shea said, Serbs ``will have emptied Kosovo in 10-20
days from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and other countries are stepping up
efforts to alleviate the suffering of refugees crossing into
Macedonia and Albania, President Clinton remains opposed to a
ground attack to protect ethnic Albanians or to roll back Serb
gains. In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton said that he
and allied leaders intended to ``exact a very high price'' from the
Serbs for driving Albanians out, but that the Operation Allied
Force bombing missions were the only method NATO would use.
</P>
<P>
   While some Balkan analysts see the merit of an ethnically
segregated Kosovo, military analysts say there is little the West
can do to establish even a foothold for ethnic Albanians without
waging a costly ground war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can do anything fast enough to make a real
difference,'' said retired Major General William Nash, who
commanded Army forces in Bosnia in 1995 and '96, and who is now at
the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs in
Washington. ``In a reasonably permissive environment, you might
have a chance to set something up, but if you go in under hostile
conditions, you end up with conditions you couldn't live with.''
</P>
<P>
   No one likes the idea of partition _ not the United States, nor
Kosovars, nor the Serbs _ and at this point Milosevic is calling
the shots in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the ground and we've got the refugees,'' said retired
Lieutenant General Terry Scott, a fellow at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government. ``Unless we are willing to take it away with
ground troops, there will never be an independent state.'' Even if
NATO could force one, said Scott, it would be a tense situation,
one he likens to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, where two rivals
peer suspiciously across an internationally supervised border,
waiting for the next war.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it is not an option, Serb nationalists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that President Milosevic wants to carve up
Kosovo, because the Serbian public is solidly behind the position
of defending Kosovo to the bitter end,'' said Radmila Milentijezic,
a former Serbian information minister.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian leaders in the United States met with Clinton
and his national security advisers last week at the White House and
urged that Kosovo not be carved up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appealed to the president not to reward Milosevic for
genocide and ethnic cleansing by giving him a piece of Kosovo,''
said Harry Bajraktari, a New York-based political advocate for
Kosovar Albanians. ``He said partition is absolutely not a
possibility. He said we are going to win this, the bombing is going
to intensify and we will hit targets that will hurt Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, when Yugoslavia was fraying, Serb intellectuals
talked openly about cantonment of the province. A former Serb
president, Dobrica Cosic, did not believe Serbs and Albanians would
be able to live together peacefully. The Belgrade Academy of Arts
and Sciences later adopted the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Milosevic unleashed Serb nationalism by
declaring to Kosovo Serbs that ``no one will ever defeat you
again,'' revoking Albanian autonomy in the province, and
sanctioning campaigns of ethnic cleansing in Croatia, Bosnia, and
Kosovo. Now the facts on the ground are changing.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees must ``go back with peace and dignity,'' Emma Bonino,
humanitarian affairs commissioner of the European Union, said
Saturday. But once people are forcibly uprooted, it is extremely
difficult to return things to normal, said retired Brigadier
General John Reppert of the Kennedy school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track record on returning war refugees is extremely bad,''
said Reppert, who has studied the problems in Bosnia, Moldova, and
Ossetia. ``Unless there is a short-term solution that freezes
positions in place, the refugee issue will become a Red Cross issue
and not a UN issue.''
</P>
<P>
   If refugees are simply herded into camps in the hills of
southwestern Kosovo, they will end up ``like Indians on a
reservation . . . they will become wards of the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will be targets for Serb artillery, said retired
Lieutenant General Bernard E. Trainor, a fellow at the Kennedy
School. ``It doesn't make any sense. They have havens right now in
Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro without having to fight for
them. Western nations should be spending their money there and
doing whatever they can to find homes for them in Cambridge, Miami,
and Australia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he and other analysts say: Unless there is a
startling turn of events, Kosovo's Albanians are not going home.

   Christians have differed over its meaning since Paul admonished
the Corinthians almost 2000 years ago for not believing in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between saying `We don't have to believe
it' and `We have difficulty believing it,' '' notes Allen Callahan,
a New Testament scholar at Harvard Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Resurrection has been all but lost in a warm and
fuzzy profusion of Easter eggs, rabbits and daffodils. What it
demands of Christians who take it seriously is awesome: a belief in
the bodily resurrection by God of his son, Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it absolutely terrifying when I have to preach on
Easter,'' says Richard Spalding, co-pastor of the Church of the
Covenant in the Back Bay, a hybrid of the United Church of Christ
and the Presbyterian Church. ``To believe in the Resurrection
stretches credulity, everything. To me, it is the Mount Everest. It
doesn't get any higher than that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a stretch that countless Christians simply cannot make.
They treat the event as metaphor, not historical fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in the bodily resurrection, but I believe in
the symbol and power of the story,'' says Betsy McAlister-Groves, a
member of Spalding's congregation. ``You can get sidetracked in
trying to figure out if it really happened. Does that then mean I'm
not a Christian? The answer for me is no.''
</P>
<P>
   For Syd Smith, another member of the congregation, who has
attended the church for 16 years, the Resurrection is even more
problematic. ``It's very scary and confusing,'' he says. ``I've
hardly known what to do with it for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is foreign to David Seales, pastor of the Central
Assembly of God, a Pentecostal church in East Boston. Seales holds
that belief in the bodily resurrection is ``absolutely crucial''to
Christianity. Must someone believe it to be a Christian?
``Certainly,'' he responds. ``Paul doesn't mince words on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the Rev. Matthew Lamb, a theology professor at
Jesuit-run Boston College. ``The `progressives' in the church are
really retrogressive,'' he says. ``Not to believe in the bodliy
resurrection is to denigrate God's creation in the whole material
universe. It is not just a moral truth. Every human being is
destined to an eternal life in the glory of heaven or the pains of
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does all of this leave a spiritual person who wants to
be a Christian but does not honestly accept the bodily resurrection
of Jesus? In a bad spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible conundrum,'' says Rose Ann Olmstead, co-pastor
with Spalding at Church of the Covenant. ``It's a place of torture
and depression, of constant feelings of failure and incompleteness.
They say, `I can't make myself fit there. I want to be a person of
faith but I don't want to give up my integrity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There is no easy answer for this group. ``They should deepen
their personal friendship with Jesus Christ,'' advises Lamb.
Olmstead takes a softer tack. ``I say to them, `Let it go. This may
not be the event or the service that's going to change your life.
God is not interested in taking captives. Find your own story.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nicholas Krommydas, chancellor of the Greek Orthodox
Diocese of Boston, acknowledges how difficult this process is, but
maintains, ``Ultimately you fall short of the intent of the New
Testament if you don't believe in the bodily resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is hamstrung by this theological knot. The Rev.
Paul Kilroy, pastor of St. Ann University Parish in the Fenway,
says the subject does not arise much among his congregation. ``It's
not a faith issue for most of our people,'' he says. ``The question
complicates the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The theologian Michael Novak believes the towering
miracle of the Resurrection is particularly hard for people to
accept today because we have lost track of the smaller miracles
that occur around us throughout the year. ``The miracles of daily
life were small steps that prepared them for the larger miracles in
the New Testament,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not so today. ``As a result,'' Novak continues, ``The
Resurrection seems far more highly unusual than for people of the
past who were much more accustomed to the terrors of life and death
and the wondrousness of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``bodily'' means is open to endless debate. Where
theologians like Lamb take it literally, others like Sam Lloyd,
rector of Trinity Church in Boston, do not. ``There was a
groundbreaking event. We don't know what it was because the
accounts are too elusive to know for sure,'' says Lloyd. ``But
Christian faith does not require Jesus's physical body to be
reassembled.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, says author James Carroll, a former Catholic
chaplain at Boston University, Paul's reference to the bodily
resurrection in his letters to the Corinthians comes secondhand.
``This is a man who never met Jesus (in the flesh),'' notes
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Kilroy chooses discretion over valor on the issue. ``I'm not
going to have a quiz on Sunday asking, `Do you believe in the
bodily resurrection?' '' he says. ``They'll respond, `What do you
mean?' and then we'll all have a fistfight.'' Besides, he adds,
``People are more interested in the results of the Resurrection and
the gift of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Carroll, ``There is theological movement within the
Catholic Church on the meaning of this story. The New Testament
reflects diversity of opinion on all of the major questions.'' The
dogged pursuit of objective data, he adds, is relatively recent.
``The proof, the physical detail _ this is an Enlightenment
obsession,'' notes Carroll. ``Before the Enlightenment, people were
much more comfortable with the mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Miracles are often more accessible to those who suffer. The
Resurrection is a case in point. ``Those on the lower strata of
society have an easier time wrestling with this,'' says Ray
Hammond, pastor of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle of the Resurrection has to be seen through the
lens of your own experience. As an African-American, the odds that
I'd be sitting here given where we were 100 years ago were very
long,'' he explains. ``It's all about faith and hope for the
impossible. In the African-American tradition, we understand what
this means in the life and death of possibility. It's very real to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, belief in the Resurrection provides the possibility
of living a different life. ``You have the capacity to risk
again,'' says Lloyd. ``The Resurrection has a huge relevance in the
orientation toward life and possibility, rather than a life of
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmstead agrees. ``What's important about it is that it makes a
mind shift possible. It allows us to see an event in a way that is
dramatically different from the view you once had of it. You see
racism for the first time. You see a Mongoloid child and realize
this is a really precious human being instead of just seeing the
limitations of that life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' she concludes, ``that God wants us to be open to
these kinds of shifts.''

CHINA-ARIZ _ Elizabeth Mann, Arizona's most important business
connection to Beijing, has risen to prominence through mastery of
what the Chinese call ``guanxi,'' the cultivation of contacts with
powerful people. Educated in the United States and China and fluent
in the languages and cultures of both countries, Mann personifies
the energetic and growing Chinese business presence in the U.S.
However, two of Mann's contacts have been linked to major scandals
and she has been the subject of two criminal investigations. By
JERRY KAMMER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GROWTH-PHX (undated) _ From Queen Creek to Surprise, Laveen to
Higley, bulldozers threaten the Mayberrys of central Arizona. Small
towns where people raise ostriches and hang out at watermelon
festivals are under siege, targeted not just for 100 or 200 new
homes, but for thousands of them. The small-town, rural atmosphere
is on a collision course with the growth machine of America's
sixth-largest city. Places that used to be in the boondocks have
become housing hot spots. By CHRIS FISCUS. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PROM (Phoenix) _ Racks and racks of donated fancy dresses lined the
quiet Phoenix store Saturday morning as a line of girls snaked
across the sidewalk outside. There is little to tell about these
dresses' pasts: a tiny hole where a pin likely held a corsage in an
elegant long purple dress; a tugging at the hem of a light pink
shift where a bridesmaid might have caught the heel of her dyed
pump; a little rip where a shimmery bracelet tore the tulle of a
white gown. But the high school girls cared less about where these
dresses _ part of a unique giveaway program _ came from and more
about where they were going. By LAURA TRUJILLO. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ I've become acquainted lately with
breathlessness, with exhaustion, with weakness. It has made me
think of young Nicky Contreraz, tortured to death at the Arizona
Boys Ranch just over a year ago. When I said I was sick, I was
believed. When Nicky said he was sick, he was forced to do push-ups
over a bucket of his excrement soiled clothing. He was required to
eat his supper while sitting on a toilet. He was ridiculed and
insulted, told he was a slacker who deserved an Academy Award. He
was killed. By E.J. MONTINI Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K''
categories. &QL;

 OLAJUWON-HNS

   &QL; 
SEATTLE _ After all the years, the seasons and the games, the shots
and the rebounds, the makes and the misses, the highs and the lows
tumble together like a kaleidoscope, and all you do is keep
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Records fall, barriers are broken, and the greatest ones never
seem to notice them, like mileposts on a wide-open freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it came to pass that Hakeem Olajuwon gathered in
the feed from Scottie Pippen in the third quarter Thursday night in
Salt Lake City, turned and fired in the sweetest 13-foot baseline
jumper to become only the 12th player in NBA history to score
25,000 points in his career, then had to be reminded of the fact
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' he said. ``I don't keep up with these things. I let
the statisticians keep up with the numbers. That is their job. Mine
is to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years he's done that like only a handful of others before
him, recently passing the likes of Elgin Baylor, Adrian Dantley and
Robert Parish on the scoring list and now closing in on greats such
as Jerry West, John Havlicek and Oscar Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the time go? And how did Olajuwon make the leap from
the young colt with the frisky legs, relentless drive and perpetual
smile at the University of Houston to a thoughtful 36-year-old and
worldwide basketball icon in the blink of our eyes?
</P>
<P>
   There's a line from Lily Tomlin's one-woman play on Broadway:
``If I'd have known it was going to be all this, I'd have settled
for half.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years with the Rockets. It's like looking through the
wrong end of a telescope. The beginning seems so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time thinking in those terms myself,'' Olajuwon
said. ``The first time anybody told me about the 25,000 points was
when we were in LA. I said, `25,000? Who are you talking about?
That can't be me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at it that way, trying to take in all 15 years
and the numbers that have been built up, and see that I am still
comfortable on the court, still full of energy, you realize that I
have been blessed to have it all happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as we have been privileged to have a courtside seat to
watch it take place. The stranger from the faraway place of Lagos,
Nigeria, who was dropped on the doorstep of Guy V. Lewis has
literally grown up in our midst, while at the same time Houston
finally has grown into a championship city because of him.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought on those first nights he stepped onto the
floor at Hofheinz Pavilion as such a raw, young talent and made
like King Kong trying to swat down every shot as if it were an
attacking airplane that he could take himself and us so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drafted him No. 1 back in 1984, we thought we were
getting a Bill Russell-type player,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, a scout in those days. ``Based on what we had seen of
him in college, we were expecting a defensive center who would be
able to challenge people coming into the lane, somebody who would
be able to go to the boards and get us some rebounds. Frankly,
anything else would have been a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   But it turned into so much more, like picking up a trinket at a
flea market and having it turn out to be the Hope Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon chuckles at the memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what they all thought of me back then,'' he said.
``Defense. That was what they got from scouting the college games.
What everybody was missing was the real learning, the real
development in my game, and all of that was taking place at Fonde
(Recreation Center).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I played against Moses (Malone) and all of the
other players from the NBA and gained my confidence. That's where I
was able to try out so many of the things that eventually became a
regular part of my game. I have always known that my game could be
much more than what other people were expecting. The seeds were
planted earlier. But Fonde is where they were cultivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular misconception is that Olajuwon's game in his early
NBA days was nothing more than an endless stream of offensive
rebounds and follow-up dunks. But if you watch the replays on ESPN
Classic Sports, you can see even then the deadly turnaround jump
shot that eventually would develop into the Dream Shake. You can
see in the highlights from the 1986 NBA Finals against the Boston
Celtics that the monster was moving faster than other big men,
spinning this way and whirling that way, and turning into something
the NBA never had seen before.
</P>
<P>
   During the NBA's golden anniversary celebration in 1997, when
Hakeem was named one of the top 50 players in history, Russell and
Wilt Chamberlain sought out Olajuwon to tell him he was the modern
player they thought carried their torch today _ relentless,
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   He has spun along the baseline and whirled in the lane like a
top for so long that we tend to forget he was the first big man to
do those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those early days in the NBA were fun, playing with Ralph
Sampson, being part of the Twin Towers,'' Olajuwon said. ``Because
we both had another big man to support us, we could both try
different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Twin Towers was an exciting time. I never thought back
then about all of the things I might be able to accomplish
individually. I have never looked at individual goals. You have to
play the game each day and always set your sights on winning a
championship right now. You can never say that your team is too
young or is several years away. You play to win now. Because the
next year or the year after are never guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw it happen up close, injuries eventually bringing
Sampson's career to a painful, grinding halt. In Olajuwon's 15
years, he has battled through phlebitis in his leg, a fractured
orbital socket and an irregular heartbeat, all the while expanding
his game and pushing at the envelope of what was possible for a big
man until it all came together in a harmonic convergence in 1994
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two years the Rockets beat us in Phoenix and went on to
win the championship, he was simply phenomenal,'' Charles Barkley
said. ``There was nothing we could do to stop him, nothing anybody
could do. He was a thing of beauty. Now, it's an honor to play with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A Most Valuable Player season in 1993-94 seemed to test his
limits, but it was only a prelude to the magical 1995 playoff run
and, in particular, the series against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like nothing I have ever seen,'' Tomjanovich said. ``To
see him take apart David Robinson the way he did. To think of all
the different moves he made. There are times today when I'll see
highlights and just feel privileged to have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the equivalent of planting a flag on Mount Everest, the
last step up to the highest peak. But from that cold, lonely place,
the only view of the world is down. That's the battle Olajuwon has
been fighting for the past three seasons as knee injuries _ and
eventually surgery on one _ took away his strength, quickness and
mobility, and the whispers grew to a roar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all of the talk, that Hakeem is not hungry anymore,
that he has his two championships and is satisfied,'' Olajuwon
said. ``They overlook the obvious, that for the past several years
I have not been physically able to play the game, to play my game,
which relies on speed and agility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so quick to forget, so quick to make judgments
without having all of the information, all of the facts. They see
me trying to play my game without getting the same results, and
suddenly it is because I am too old or not hungry anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating when you are used to being a dominating
player and you find that you can't dominate. It has nothing to do
with being satisfied. If anything, I was less satisfied over the
past several years, because I was not myself. I knew it was a
physical problem, but that did not make it easier for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated his commitment by embarking on an offseason
training program under the guidance of triple jumper Frank
Rutherford, a fellow UH alum, regaining the strength in his legs to
make all of the explosive moves and rediscovering the fluidity to
spin on the baseline for his jump shot or dance into the lane for
his baby hook.
</P>
<P>
   It was a learning process as Olajuwon searched for his timing
while hunting for his proper place in a crowded offense that
includes Barkley and Pippen. The early weeks of the shortened
season were a struggle, but the past month has seen Olajuwon
steadily regain his form. He scored 32 points against the Jazz and
dominated the third quarter with 14 points, three rebounds, two
blocked shots and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 wonderful minutes, it was all back. And those games are
stringing together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have anything to prove,'' Olajuwon said. ``Anything
that I do now is not a reaction to criticism or talk. It is about
being healthy. For the first time in several years, I can play
without the pain or the limitations that my body was putting on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exciting for me that I can make the moves and feel like
they are natural again. The game is fun again. I am enthusiastic
each night, and there is no reason to think I can't go on.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says two more years, taking him to the end of his current
contract, will be enough. It is times like these, stopping to note
mileposts like 25,000 points, that tell him it's been a longer road
than he ever imagined when getting off that plane from Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never set goals like that, but the number speaks for
itself,'' he said. ``I've had some problems, some injuries.
Overall, I have had a wonderful career.''
</P>
<P>
   The smile is warm, the satisfaction genuine. But now those
chocolate-brown eyes are dancing again, and you can tell Hakeem is
dreaming of the next time he gets the basketball, the next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' he said.

JORDAN STIRS UP HORNETS NEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA - which threatens to be fan-tas-tic all over the place
refuses to look away from its interests in Dixie, where
constituents still believe ``trail mix'' refers to the
fraternization of Coca-Cola and Jack Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the IQ of two GQ coaches, there is on-court prosperity
in Florida. Even though Mookie Blaylock's shooting percentage is
falling, a new arena is rising in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But a comprehensive revival just might hit the spot in good, ol'
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Hornets now have Eddie Jones at shooting guard, but
they're a little thin at shooting owner.
</P>
<P>
   So league commissioner David Stern and Hornets owner George
Shinn dropped a dime on Michael ``CEO'' Jordan. They want Michael
to purchase half of the team. They surveyed the box scores, and
realized Jordan has owned the Hornets for years, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, wooing Jordan sounds like a dandy plan, even though
recruiting the greatest basketball player in history for ownership
seems a bit like purchasing a stealth bomber to dust crops.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan's involvement would generate interest, and help push
Charlotte's creaking, 11-year-old, 23,000-seat arena (including its
woefully inadequate 12 skyboxes) into the abyss of obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   What it already has done is inspire Chicken Little ``scoops''
concerning Jordan's return to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Chew on this:
</P>
<P>
   Jordan would slum around with the other Hornets and lure NBC
while his ownership loot is placed in escrow. See, the NBA does not
allow players to own teams. When Jerry Buss of the Lakers was told
owners couldn't be players
</P>
<P>
   , he reflected upon his dating scorecard and thought he would be
ordered to sell the team.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with rumors of Jordan back in uniform, the obvious
incredibility leap required rumormongers to install Phil Jackson as
Charlotte's new bench boss. Free of the Zen &AMP; Jerrys management
strife he endured in Chicago, Jackson could even make personnel
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's believed Phil thinks Charlotte is too square
to truly appreciate the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Jordan's camp has announced that the tale of his
on-court return is pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ownership news is real. But if Jordan owns 50
percent and Shinn owns 50 percent, who makes the big decisions? If
Jordan is not allowed to purchase a majority interest, his bailout
investment seems like nothing more to the franchise than found
money.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely (sorry, Nike), if Jordan holds the hammer, on-court
proceedings probably would be altered in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Hornets player, having Jordan as the boss might feel
a bit like finding out your landlady is Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   At least you'd feel pressure to clean up your act.

   (SUBHED) Talking Euro trash
</P>
<P>
   The last time Stern presided over the NBA Draft's first round,
four European players (not including the University of Pacific's
Michael Olowokandi) were selected.
</P>
<P>
   After pestering several NBA scouts, we can reveal it is quite
possible that only one Euro will crack the first-round lineup in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Weiss is a 22-year-old 7-footer who's playing
professionally in France. But Weiss' most-prominent adviser also is
the big cheese of his current team. So don't be shocked if Weiss is
not in the NBA next season.
</P>
<P>
   (SUBHED) Kid stuff
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidates to hop from high school to the NBA this
year are 6-11 Jonathan Bender of Picayune, Miss., and 6-91/2
DerMarr Johnson, a Maryland kid who completed his prep career at
Maine Central Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Both players participated in a tournament at Cal State Dominguez
Hills last summer, where their alleged uninspired performances
failed to attract the blessings of greatness freely given by the
self-annointed judges of prep hoop talent.
</P>
<P>
   But Bender and Johnson are the rage now. Bender scored 31 points
in the McDonald's-sponsored all-star game to tie a record held by
Jordan. Johnson looked slick while tossing in 19.
</P>
<P>
   Some NBA watchdogs consider Bender a lottery pick, while Johnson
might be selected late in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   If they decided to bypass college.
</P>
<P>
   (SUBHED) Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls will have miles of salary-cap room after this
season, but may choose to hire a few economical players to go with
their lottery pick and a Euro or two. After helping the Magic
clobber the Bulls on Friday, Orlando's Penny Hardaway who can opt
out of his contract this summer almost begged for the Bulls to sign
him. ... It was a tough week for Portland's Isaiah ``Take It Easy''
Rider. In addition to wading into the expensive seats to hold a
debate with a Warriors fan, he was sued for causing ``emotional
distress'' during an incident in Detroit in 1997. The plaintiff, it
should be pointed out, is not former Blazers coach P.J. Carlesimo.
... If you look beyond the hype, you'll see that Vancouver's Mike
Bibby is having a better rookie season than Sacramento's Jason
Williams. Both are averaging 13 points per game, but Bibby is
shooting 42 percent from the field and handing out almost seven
assists per game. Williams' corresponding numbers are 38 percent
and 5.5 dimes. Bibby also stinks a bit less on defense. Williams'
offense has been a bit ripe the last eight games; the kid has made
just 28 percent of his field-goal attempts, which suggests a more
appropriate nickname might be ``Off-White Chocolate.''

 OLAJUWON-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
By Fran Blinebury
<TEXT>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After all the years, the seasons and the games, the
shots and the rebounds, the makes and the misses, the highs and the
lows tumble together like a kaleidoscope, and all you do is keep
playing.
</P>
<P>
   Records fall, barriers are broken, and the greatest ones never
seem to notice them, like mileposts on a wide-open freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how it came to pass that Hakeem Olajuwon gathered in
the feed from Scottie Pippen in the third quarter Thursday night in
Salt Lake City, turned and fired in the sweetest 13-foot baseline
jumper to become only the 12th player in NBA history to score
25,000 points in his career, then had to be reminded of the fact
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' he said. ``I don't keep up with these things. I let
the statisticians keep up with the numbers. That is their job. Mine
is to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years he's done that like only a handful of others before
him, recently passing the likes of Elgin Baylor, Adrian Dantley and
Robert Parish on the scoring list and now closing in on greats such
as Jerry West, John Havlicek and Oscar Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the time go? And how did Olajuwon make the leap from
the young colt with the frisky legs, relentless drive and perpetual
smile at the University of Houston to a thoughtful 36-year-old and
worldwide basketball icon in the blink of our eyes?
</P>
<P>
   There's a line from Lily Tomlin's one-woman play on Broadway:
``If I'd have known it was going to be all this, I'd have settled
for half.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years with the Rockets. It's like looking through the
wrong end of a telescope. The beginning seems so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time thinking in those terms myself,'' Olajuwon
said. ``The first time anybody told me about the 25,000 points was
when we were in LA. I said, `25,000? Who are you talking about?
That can't be me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at it that way, trying to take in all 15 years
and the numbers that have been built up, and see that I am still
comfortable on the court, still full of energy, you realize that I
have been blessed to have it all happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as we have been privileged to have a courtside seat to
watch it take place. The stranger from the faraway place of Lagos,
Nigeria, who was dropped on the doorstep of Guy V. Lewis has
literally grown up in our midst, while at the same time Houston
finally has grown into a championship city because of him.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought on those first nights he stepped onto the
floor at Hofheinz Pavilion as such a raw, young talent and made
like King Kong trying to swat down every shot as if it were an
attacking airplane that he could take himself and us so far?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drafted him No. 1 back in 1984, we thought we were
getting a Bill Russell-type player,'' said Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich, a scout in those days. ``Based on what we had seen of
him in college, we were expecting a defensive center who would be
able to challenge people coming into the lane, somebody who would
be able to go to the boards and get us some rebounds. Frankly,
anything else would have been a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   But it turned into so much more, like picking up a trinket at a
flea market and having it turn out to be the Hope Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon chuckles at the memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what they all thought of me back then,'' he said.
``Defense. That was what they got from scouting the college games.
What everybody was missing was the real learning, the real
development in my game, and all of that was taking place at Fonde
(Recreation Center).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I played against Moses (Malone) and all of the
other players from the NBA and gained my confidence. That's where I
was able to try out so many of the things that eventually became a
regular part of my game. I have always known that my game could be
much more than what other people were expecting. The seeds were
planted earlier. But Fonde is where they were cultivated.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular misconception is that Olajuwon's game in his early
NBA days was nothing more than an endless stream of offensive
rebounds and follow-up dunks. But if you watch the replays on ESPN
Classic Sports, you can see even then the deadly turnaround jump
shot that eventually would develop into the Dream Shake. You can
see in the highlights from the 1986 NBA Finals against the Boston
Celtics that the monster was moving faster than other big men,
spinning this way and whirling that way, and turning into something
the NBA never had seen before.
</P>
<P>
   During the NBA's golden anniversary celebration in 1997, when
Hakeem was named one of the top 50 players in history, Russell and
Wilt Chamberlain sought out Olajuwon to tell him he was the modern
player they thought carried their torch today _ relentless,
dominating.
</P>
<P>
   He has spun along the baseline and whirled in the lane like a
top for so long that we tend to forget he was the first big man to
do those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those early days in the NBA were fun, playing with Ralph
Sampson, being part of the Twin Towers,'' Olajuwon said. ``Because
we both had another big man to support us, we could both try
different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Twin Towers was an exciting time. I never thought back
then about all of the things I might be able to accomplish
individually. I have never looked at individual goals. You have to
play the game each day and always set your sights on winning a
championship right now. You can never say that your team is too
young or is several years away. You play to win now. Because the
next year or the year after are never guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw it happen up close, injuries eventually bringing
Sampson's career to a painful, grinding halt. In Olajuwon's 15
years, he has battled through phlebitis in his leg, a fractured
orbital socket and an irregular heartbeat, all the while expanding
his game and pushing at the envelope of what was possible for a big
man until it all came together in a harmonic convergence in 1994
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two years the Rockets beat us in Phoenix and went on to
win the championship, he was simply phenomenal,'' Charles Barkley
said. ``There was nothing we could do to stop him, nothing anybody
could do. He was a thing of beauty. Now, it's an honor to play with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   A Most Valuable Player season in 1993-94 seemed to test his
limits, but it was only a prelude to the magical 1995 playoff run
and, in particular, the series against San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like nothing I have ever seen,'' Tomjanovich said. ``To
see him take apart David Robinson the way he did. To think of all
the different moves he made. There are times today when I'll see
highlights and just feel privileged to have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the equivalent of planting a flag on Mount Everest, the
last step up to the highest peak. But from that cold, lonely place,
the only view of the world is down. That's the battle Olajuwon has
been fighting for the past three seasons as knee injuries _ and
eventually surgery on one _ took away his strength, quickness and
mobility, and the whispers grew to a roar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard all of the talk, that Hakeem is not hungry anymore,
that he has his two championships and is satisfied,'' Olajuwon
said. ``They overlook the obvious, that for the past several years
I have not been physically able to play the game, to play my game,
which relies on speed and agility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so quick to forget, so quick to make judgments
without having all of the information, all of the facts. They see
me trying to play my game without getting the same results, and
suddenly it is because I am too old or not hungry anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is frustrating when you are used to being a dominating
player and you find that you can't dominate. It has nothing to do
with being satisfied. If anything, I was less satisfied over the
past several years, because I was not myself. I knew it was a
physical problem, but that did not make it easier for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated his commitment by embarking on an offseason
training program under the guidance of triple jumper Frank
Rutherford, a fellow UH alum, regaining the strength in his legs to
make all of the explosive moves and rediscovering the fluidity to
spin on the baseline for his jump shot or dance into the lane for
his baby hook.
</P>
<P>
   It was a learning process as Olajuwon searched for his timing
while hunting for his proper place in a crowded offense that
includes Barkley and Pippen. The early weeks of the shortened
season were a struggle, but the past month has seen Olajuwon
steadily regain his form. He scored 32 points against the Jazz and
dominated the third quarter with 14 points, three rebounds, two
blocked shots and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 wonderful minutes, it was all back. And those games are
stringing together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have anything to prove,'' Olajuwon said. ``Anything
that I do now is not a reaction to criticism or talk. It is about
being healthy. For the first time in several years, I can play
without the pain or the limitations that my body was putting on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is exciting for me that I can make the moves and feel like
they are natural again. The game is fun again. I am enthusiastic
each night, and there is no reason to think I can't go on.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says two more years, taking him to the end of his current
contract, will be enough. It is times like these, stopping to note
mileposts like 25,000 points, that tell him it's been a longer road
than he ever imagined when getting off that plane from Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never set goals like that, but the number speaks for
itself,'' he said. ``I've had some problems, some injuries.
Overall, I have had a wonderful career.''
</P>
<P>
   The smile is warm, the satisfaction genuine. But now those
chocolate-brown eyes are dancing again, and you can tell Hakeem is
dreaming of the next time he gets the basketball, the next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' he said.

PLAYER COMPLAINTS ARE GORILLA WARFARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something that bothers more than a few NBA players when they
travel to Phoenix, but rarely gets discussed, has once again caused
a stir.
</P>
<P>
   The agent for Sacramento Kings center Oliver Miller is claiming
the Suns are guilty of racism because of a recent skit performed by
the infamous Gorilla mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blakeley filed a complaint through the NBA Players
Association with the league office, because Miller was upset
regarding a skit that ridiculed the 390-pound center's weight
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Gorilla lampooned the 6-foot-9 former Phoenix player by
wearing a Kings jersey with Miller's name and number on it.
</P>
<P>
   The jersey was stuffed with pillows. The Gorilla waddled, then
fell to the floor. Miller's family also happened to be in
attendance that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For an obese, black, ugly gorilla to portray a professional
African-American basketball player is very offensive,'' Blakeley
told the Toronto Globe and Mail. ``In my mind and in the minds of
many of the players who are in a predominantly black league, a
gorilla is imprudent. It's racist, we think, and we can't believe
the Suns continue to have a mascot like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that NBA players remember how stubborn Arizona
was in recognizing Martin Luther King Day.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has never controlled his weight, isn't exactly the
most credible player to protest the Gorilla's antics. But some
might feel differently if you knew the racism charge was first
leveled by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar when he played with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar once got into a shoving match with the Gorilla in
front of the Lakers bench.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Suns forward Clifford Robinson, who is an African-American, said
he doesn't consider the Gorilla to be a racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Robinson said. ``I found what he does quite
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is Suns owner Jerry Colangelo, who often acts
like he can do anything, except win an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo admitted the skit may have crossed the line of decency
but refused to consider complaints about the gorilla's racial
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say absolutely, unequivocally that has never been
true,'' Colangelo said. ``There may be different views about skits,
about whether they are in good taste or bad taste. But the fact is,
it has always been in the form of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about time Colangelo, one of the NBA's old-guard owners,
gives the Gorilla an early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Hold off the celebration: Before everyone gets too carried away
with the Trail Blazers' incredible start, two things to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _The club has a much tougher second-half schedule, including
four games with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   _Portland is showing signs of displaying its better-known
personality traits.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared throughout Wednesday's game against Sacramento,
forcing coach Mike Dunleavy into the role as the leader of what is
sometimes the NBA's most successful three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider did not play against the Kings because of a league
suspension, Stacey Augmon was ejected after a running feud with
Sacramento guard Vernon Maxwell, and Rasheed Wallace was so angry
that at one point he cursed at Dunleavy and warned the coach to get
away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No coaching job in the NBA is easy,'' diplomat Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   Not worth a dime: As further proof that Orlando's Penny Hardaway
is one of the most despised players in the league, even
professional malcontent Derrick Coleman (of all people) ragged him
hard last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically walked up to me and said I was washed up,''
Hardaway said of a little chat with DC during the game that
resulted in both getting technical fouls. ``Apparently a lot of
people around the league feel the same way. I'm not having any more
games like this for the rest of the season. You're going to see a
different Penny Hardaway. I can't have people disrespecting me.''
</P>
<P>
   So three games later, Penny goes 4 of 10 with 11 points, four
assists and three rebounds in a loss at Washington. Even worse, he
sits out the entire fourth quarter even though the Magic was down
by just four points with four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what (Chuck) Daly was thinking,'' Hardaway said.
``How do you leave your top guy on the bench with the game on the
line? It doesn't surprise me what he does. You have to go with the
flow to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   No homer: Former Celtics great Bob Cousy, who does color
commentary for the team, doesn't mind telling it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they start playing well, I'll be the biggest cheerleader
they've ever had. But when they suck, I'm going to tell people how
I feel,'' Cousy said. ``I'm not going to blame the refs (something
partner Tom Heinsohn does constantly), or say that the guy has a
bad ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie. I feel sorry for Rick Pitino right now
and I worry about him. Sometimes I think he's going to have a
nervous breakdown if he keeps going at that pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick observation: The Clippers might not have a better record
if they had drafted Toronto swingman Vince Carter (18.4 points, 6.0
rebounds, 2.6 assists, 1.35 blocked shots in 35.3 minutes per
game), but they sure would be a lot more entertaining to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the shadow: Guard Damon Frierson spent most of this past
season playing behind All-American teammate Wally Szczerbiak at
Miami University in Ohio. But Wednesday night at the Portsmouth
Invitational Tournament in Virginia, Frierson wowed NBA scouts by
scoring 17 of his game-high 25 points in the second half of the
tournament's opening game. &QL;

KNICKS TRY TO HEAL IN MIND AND BODY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ With a victory over the Indiana Pacers just
four days ago, Coach Jeff Van Gundy did not need to remind the
Knicks of strategies or tendencies as they worked out Saturday at
SUNY-Purchase. But what the team did need before flying off to face
the Pacers in Indianapolis for a nationally televised game on
Sunday afternoon was the gentle stretching and massaging of the
training staff and the not-so-gentle massaging of their minds by
the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   What they face on Sunday is not only Indiana (21-11), the
Central Division leader, but an assortment of physical ailments in
their own locker room. Larry Johnson, Patrick Ewing, Chris Dudley
and Marcus Camby all sat out Saturday's practice, leaving Kurt
Thomas, Herb Williams and Ben Davis as the only frontcourt players
available.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who sprained his right knee in the Knicks' victory over
Indiana on Tuesday, said Saturday that he would not play on Sunday.
Ewing most likely will play through the pain of a sore left
Achilles' tendon, and Dudley (sore left knee) and Camby (left groin
strain) were listed as day to day. Davis, who is on the injured
list, could be activated before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just probably jumped the gun a little bit I guess,'' said
Johnson, who sat out Thursday's game against Cleveland but said
before that game that he would return on Sunday. ``I ran that day
before the game and I rode the bike and I felt pretty good. But
when I was sitting on the bench, I didn't feel good at all. It's
not where I want it to be. I want to look at it tomorrow, try to
get there early, run up and down on the court and see how I feel.
Maybe I'll play Tuesday or Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ewing should be available, Van Gundy tried to keep the
team from using the injuries as an excuse. The two days off, Friday
and Saturday, were the first such breather for the Knicks in a
month. It was clearly not enough of a break to get the team
healthy. Even with two consecutive victories, the Knicks are 18-14,
clinging to the seventh seeding in the Eastern Conference playoff
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not discouraged,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's just how it is.
You have to deal with it the best way you can, which is to move
forward and get ready for the game. Whoever you have, you go out
there expecting to win. I don't know who we're going to have
tomorrow, but I know one thing, if we're not expecting to win, then
we shouldn't even get on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   While the physical woes may or may not be healed enough by game
time, Van Gundy said it would be simple to tell if the mental
approach was intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be able to see it by how we play,'' Van Gundy said.
``If we're playing aggressively and hard, then we're playing to
win. It's what we've got to do, because sometimes you can feel
sorry for yourself in situations like this and moan about what you
don't have instead of concentrating on what we do have. I want our
guys to concentrate on what we do have, which is enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will start Latrell Sprewell in Johnson's place on
Sunday for the second straight game. After impatiently waiting for
his opportunity to start, Sprewell struggled through an 11-point
performance with more turnovers (four) than field goals (three) on
Thursday. If Dudley and Ewing are healthy enough, they will start
in the frontcourt, with Thomas filling in.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are back to full strength after playing the Knicks
without Antonio Davis on Tuesday and losing Jalen Rose to an
ejection in the second period of that game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Van Gundy does not want players to rush back into the
lineup, particularly Johnson, who underwent a magnetic resonance
imaging examination following Tuesday's game. That revealed a
grade-one sprain of the medial collateral ligament. Johnson has not
seen the team doctors since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be back,'' Van Gundy said of Johnson. ``The
problem is you can't wait until you're totally healthy or else the
season will be over because of the schedule. And if you come back
too soon and reinjure yourself, you can miss, like, 12 games. It's
really a fine line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this season was going to be like this because of the
compacted schedule. We just have to deal with it. We'll have enough
guys. You go out there with the right mentality, we're going to
have an opportunity to win.''

NATO DESTROYS 2ND BRIDGE ON DANUBE AND A RAIL LINK

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after reducing security ministries in
downtown Belgrade to collapsed rubble, allied forces destroyed a
second bridge over the Danube River in Yugoslavia Saturday while
NATO troops in neighboring Bosnia blew up a railway that officials
said the Yugoslav army was planning to use as a resupply line for
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring a deepening military involvement, Secretary of
Defense William Cohen has approved a request by NATO's supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, to send Apache attack helicopters to
Albania along with two types of rocket batteries used to back them
up, a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the Apaches, the Army's low-flying gunship
used to destroy tanks, still needs to receive approval from NATO's
political authorities, who remain wary of the introduction of the
helicopter and the rockets. The Apaches carry the political risk of
being viewed as the introduction of ground troops, because to put a
battalion of the Apaches and a battalion of each of the rockets
into Albania would require putting a force of 2,000 Army soldiers
on the ground in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt _
with 46 strike jets _ to cancel a planned trip to the Persian Gulf
and join in the strikes against Yugoslavia. The carrier, which is
expected to enter the Adriatic Sea by Monday, is accompanied by
three other ships and two submarines able to fire Tomahawk cruise
missiles, bringing the total number of those vessels in the region
to 11.
</P>
<P>
   The order followed the addition of 13 more American F-117
stealth fighters and five B-1 bombers, as well as new contributions
from the British and French earlier this past week. Before the
attacks began on March 24, American and NATO officials had insisted
that they had more than enough air power in the region to carry out
a sustained campaign against the forces of President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes Saturday against the bridge in the northern Serbian
town of Novi Sad began what officials said would be an intense
night of air raids and missile strikes against targets throughout
Yugoslavia. Dozens of aircraft, including F-117 fighters, departed
from bases in Italy as darkness fell, while B-52s equipped with
cruise missiles left a base in England.
</P>
<P>
   Although attacks were hampered again by rain and dense clouds
reaching to 30,000 feet, there were signs of clearing Saturday
night, and officials at NATO and in Washington vowed to use any
breaks in the weather to redouble the attack against those Yugoslav
forces routing ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On the 11th day of its raids on Yugoslavia, NATO found itself
grappling with two deepening missions at once: a military one and a
humanitarian one.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it pressed attacks, the alliance announced Saturday that
it was considering sending a force of 6,000 to 8,000 troops to
Albania to help impose control along the border with Kosovo, where
thousands of refugees are massing with little food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced the delivery of the first 30,000 of
500,000 rations of food for refugees in Albania and said it planned
to send 200 tents, 8,000 sleeping bags and 1,500 cots to Macedonia,
to which thousands of refugees have fled.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge destroyed Saturday was the second blown up in Novi
Sad, a major city northwest of Belgrade. The first, a steel
suspension span, collapsed in a twisted wreck after being struck by
missiles fired from an American F-15 on Thursday. The second
bridge, a newer concrete span, was struck not long after dark in
Yugoslavia Saturday night. Serbian television showed the bridge
split in two in the Danube, Europe's longest waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav authorities and witnesses interviewed by Serbian
television said there were cars crossing the bridge at the time of
the strike, but there was no immediate report on casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks in Novi Sad cut one of the main transportation links
between Belgrade and the northern part of the country. NATO
commanders defended the destruction of the bridges, even though
both are far from the fighting in Kosovo to the south. At NATO's
headquarters in Brussels, a military spokesman, Air Commodore David
Wilby of Britain, said Saturday that ``vital supplies'' for
Yugoslav military and police units crossed the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual expansion of its tactics, NATO also used its
peacekeeping troops in neighboring Bosnia to destroy a rail link
between Yugoslavia's dominant republic, Serbia, and the second
remaining republic, Montenegro. Some six miles of the railway
skirted Bosnian territory, a legacy of the formerly unified
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said troops from NATO's Stabilization
Force blew up the railway early Saturday morning, ostensibly to
enforce the terms of the peace agreement governing Bosnia, which
prohibits hostile forces from operating anywhere in the country.
But the officials said NATO believed that Milosevic's forces were
preparing to use the link to send troops and equipment into
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   While such forces could have continued on to Kosovo to reinforce
the campaign under way there, Milosevic may also have been moving
to crack down against Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, who
has not displayed blind loyalty to Belgrade since the attacks
began.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the NATO allies have seen Djukanovic as a
potential challenger to Milosevic's iron grip on what remains of
Yugoslavia. And cutting the railway could well help head off
attempts by Belgrade to crack down there, attempts that Britain's
Ministry of Defense warned on Friday appeared to be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the raids, Milosevic's forces continued their attacks in
Kosovo. Wilby said two Serbian paramilitary groups ``with a proven
record of brutality'' _ the Tigers and the White Eagles _ were
looting villages.
</P>
<P>
   With the foul weather grounding most aircraft, NATO has been
able to do little to attack the forces fighting in the field in
Kosovo.

DODGERS' MALONE PLAYS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No task is too small for Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone. If he's going to do something, he's going to give it
his all. And he expects to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   All the time.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he was hired by the Dodgers last year, a retreat to
Vero Beach, Fla., was organized so all the new faces in the team's
front office could get to know each other better. As a bonding
exercise, people were split into teams to compete in a series of
contests designed to build teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team won all the games,'' Malone said. There was a timed
contest to build a bridge made of Legos. Malone's team not only won
but set the all-time team record for time and pieces used. His team
also won the song contest and the sheep calling contest.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat ended with a softball game. Malone managed one team
against former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda's team. Any guesses on
the winner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maloney's Baloneys won,'' Malone said with a coy smile.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, 41, doesn't just enjoy competition, he thrives on it.
That's how you go from being a $12,000-a-year scout to the top
baseball official of one of the most powerful organizations in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so competitive-spirited,'' Dodgers president and CEO Bob
Graziano said. ``What I like about him is his thorough and complete
understanding of scouting and baseball. You have to have that
spirit to be able to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been that way for Malone, who grew up in Louisville,
Ky. His brother Kyle remembers how intense he was. Once in a Little
League game, in the last inning of a blowout, the coach asked Kyle
to play right field. Kyle declined, saying he didn't want to get
hot and sweaty for one meaningless inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin came over, grabbed me, threw me on the ground and kicked
dirt on me,'' Kyle said. ``Then he said, `Now you're dirty so get
out there.' . . . Nobody wanted to play the Malone boys in our
neighborhood. Kevin never let us lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone despises losing in any context. This spring at
Dodgertown, Malone would play basketball almost nightly.
</P>
<P>
   The games were measured by sweat buckets and bruises. On most
nights, Malone's team would win (who would beat the boss?), but
when he lost he would often lament the next day about what he could
have done differently to win, or he'd stay on the court afterward
to work on his jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Late at night at his Louisville home, his father, Tim, said he
was often awakened by loud noises in the backyard. It would be
young Kevin, throwing a ball against the house or swinging a bat
against an old tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wanted to win so he worked so hard,'' Tim Malone
said. ``Baseball. He loved it. He always wanted to play. He always
wanted to get a game going. I never heard him say, `Oh, no. Not
today.' He couldn't get enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, get enough of losing in Montreal. After two
years as the Expos general manager, Malone was frustrated that
ownership wanted him to preside over a fire sale less than two
years after the Expos went a major- league-best 74-40 before the
1994 players' strike.
</P>
<P>
   His personality doesn't jive with not trying to win. In good
conscience, Malone couldn't remain in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I lose I get sick to my stomach,'' Malone said. ``People
in the smaller markets saying they have no hope, they have no
chance _ that's unacceptable. If I ever heard my general manager
say that, I'd fire him. Find a way to get it done or go do
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that attitude that allowed Malone to build a career.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was a second baseman, playing at Florida Southern
University for a semester before he transferred to the University
of Louisville, where he earned a baseball scholarship and was later
inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame. When his playing
days were done, he found another way to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Malone began at the bottom as an area scout for the
California Angels. He spent three years sitting in Los Angeles
traffic, hurrying from one game to another. He scouted for the
Minnesota Twins, then moved up through the Expos organization
before spending the last two seasons as assistant general manager
of the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has an eye for scouting players, a talent. But it's
backed up equally by hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he called us last September,'' his father
recalls. ``He said, `I got the job in Los Angeles.' I got choked up
and his mother started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Tim Malone, he'll tell you dedication and an
unrelenting drive got his son the Dodgers' job.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone doesn't disagree, but he is quick to point out one
other factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting this Dodger job, I've worked hard and I had some
success and I have some knowledge,'' Malone said, ``but it had to
be by the grace of God. It had to be by His control that I'm the
Dodgers general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone can boast with the best, but in this instant he is humble
because he is also a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Between his playing days and his scouting days, he spent time at
the Tennessee Temple Theological Seminary in Chattanooga, Tenn,
where he met his wife, Marilyn. He had planned to enter the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Malone delicately balances an imaginary line. He
will not overburden anyone with his religious beliefs, but he will
quote Scripture during difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here on this earth to point people toward Him, and that
doesn't mean I'm a freak,'' Malone said. ``I've been called a Jesus
freak. I've been called a lot of things, but my point was always,
`Hey, you saw the way I used to live my life _ selfish, no regard
for people, took advantage of people, used people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was _ (begin ital)was(end ital) _ a freak. Then I suddenly
have a change in my life . . . and now I'm what they call a Jesus
freak.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the other side of Malone, a devoted family man who takes
his two children, Shannon (12) and Shawn (9) to school most days.
He says his discovery of religion saved him from peril. He's still
a competitor, but he conducts himself with humility and compassion
for others.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting in the press box at Dodgertown's Holman Stadium,
Malone sometimes stopped kids who were passing by. He'd offer them
a soda, pose for pictures, sign a baseball or just chat.
</P>
<P>
   But competition and challenge are the major reasons Malone took
the job with the Dodgers. He said the Fox Group told him he would
receive the financial support needed to build a winning team.
</P>
<P>
   So he spent $124 million on free agents, revamped the
minor-league system and restored confidence bordering on cockiness
to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what's going to happen with injuries,'' Malone
said during spring training. ``If we stay healthy, I think we can
be in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   With Malone, you wouldn't expect it any other way.

HOLLANDSWORTH GOES ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Todd Hollandsworth, the former Rookie of the Year
who had nailed down the Dodgers' fourth outfielder spot, was placed
on the 15-day disabled list Saturday with a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth suffered the injury to his right leg after running
out a ground ball during Friday night's 8-1 victory over the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Hollandsworth was walking without a limp. But
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Hollandsworth ``could barely
walk'' Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, who demanded a trade in the offseason, was the
Dodgers' top hitter this spring, batting .418 with three homers and
eight RBI in a team-high 79 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a workhorse (this spring),'' Johnson said. ``I was
shocked to see him go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Placing Hollandsworth on the DL probably means outfielders
Trenidad Hubbard and Jacob Brumfield will make the roster. But
Johnson said he's leaning toward carrying three catchers: Todd
Hundley, Rick Wilkins and rookie Paul LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hundley)'s legs were a little heavy last night,'' Johnson
said. ``I don't want to bury him after the first week to 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca, 26, played in 126 games at Triple-A Albuquerque last
year and six with the Dodgers. He entered Saturday with a .316
spring batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've contributed to the team,'' LoDuca said.
``I've handled the pitching staff OK. Yes, I would be disappointed
if I didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Auditioning: Three rookie pitchers bidding to make the roster
pitched Friday in Anaheim, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handers Jeff Williams and Onan Masaoka and right-hander
Jamie Arnold all pitched scoreless innings, but Williams and
Masaoka both walked two and Arnold walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka, the most impressive rookie in Vero Beach, struck out
Garret Anderson to get out of a bases-loaded situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to see Masaoka get out of a little jam,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, who just turned 25, is an intriguing prospect. He was a
first-round pick by the Braves in 1992 but only pitched in nine
games above Double-A in seven seasons. He is a converted starter
with a career minor-league record of 32-44.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran relievers Greg Cadaret and Pedro Borbon were scheduled
to make appearances Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my left-handers in the bullpen to get a taste of their
left-handed hitters,'' Johnson said. ``They may not like the taste
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilly preview: It was fitting the first visit by the Yankees to
Dodger Stadium since the 1981 World Series was accompanied by a
temperature that dipped into the 50s during batting practice. It
was weather that, well, reminded one of October.
</P>
<P>
   Will these two teams meet again in the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best team in baseball,'' said Kevin Malone, the
Dodgers general manager, of the world-champion Yankees. ``They have
proved they are the best. They are where we want to be.''

GENERAL CHALLENGE ROMPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- General Challenge, taught a few lessons during a trip
to Louisiana last month, took a talented Santa Anita Derby field to
school Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden confidently by Gary Stevens, the 3-year-old gelding went
into high gear at the three-eighths pole and cruised to a 3
1/2-length victory over 2-1 favorite Prime Timber in the $750,000
Grade I steppingstone to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   It was another 3 1/2 lengths back to 5-2 second choice Desert
Hero before an on-track crowd of 35,023.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge's reputation took a hit in the Louisiana Derby
when he lunged at the start, made a big move and then flattened out
in the stretch. Now, he could be favored when the field goes
postward for the Kentucky Derby on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That race was kind of a disaster,'' Stevens said of General
Challenge's first action outside of California. ``But I think it
worked out as a positive for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot happen to him in just the last month, with
shipping to New Orleans for his first time racing out of town and
then flying back here. He's been asked to clear some pretty good
hurdles.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of General Meeting cleared his latest hurdle with plenty
to spare. He looked more like the horse who won the Grade II Santa
Catalina Stakes so impressively in January at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like once they have that initial experience of
traveling and being in a battle, they're either going to respond
negatively or positively,'' Stevens said. ``That's what separates
the very good horses from the mediocre horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had every right today to regress again, but he took a huge
step forward. I think that says a lot for his character and what
kind of race horse he is.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge sat just off pacesetter High Wire Act's early
fractions of 23.46, 47.30 and 1:11.46 before Stevens moved on him
as the field approached the far turn. He led by a half-length at
the top of the stretch and toyed with the others the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it was the addition of blinkers that helped a Bob
Baffert-trained horse. Baffert added blinkers to Prime Timber in
last month's Grade II San Felipe Stakse and he responded with a
two-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was General Challenge's turn, and he loved the
equipment change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't make him run faster, but they did make him
focus,'' Stevens said. ``It's basically like the little kid that
you tell 'em to sit in the corner and keep their mouth shut and
their eyes and ears open. That's what the blinkers do for him.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge's final time of 1:48 4/5 for the 1 1/8 miles
was well off the stakes record of 1:47, but it was good enough to
give Baffert his third Santa Anita Derby victory in the past four
years. It was Stevens' seventh victory in the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sent off as the 5-2 third choice in the wagering, General
Challenge returned $7.60 for his fourth victory in five races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for him to do this,'' Baffert said. ``He's
just learning how to run. He just plays around. The blinkers made
the difference. He was a big, goofy son-of-a-gun. He needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest disappointment in the race was trainer Bobby
Frankel's filly, Honest Lady. The daughter of Seattle Slew laid
close much of the race along the rail, but had nothing in the
stretch and faded to seventh in the eight-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was not available for comment, but jockey Kent
Desormeaux was puzzled by the showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think something is amiss with her,'' he said.
``She just wasn't herself today. We didn't want the lead today. I
loved my spot. I was sitting right in the pocket, waiting to
explode. Unfortunately, when the opportunity presented itself to
push forward, my gun wasn't loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber almost did not run. Baffert said the son of Sultry
Song had a large bruise on his left hind leg Friday and came close
to being scratched before it improved by early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   David Flores had Prime Timber sitting fifth through much of the
early going before he unleashed a nice kick that resulted in a
second-place finish and a probable berth in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with the way he finished,'' Flores said. ``I
know that Silver Charm was second in this race two years ago and
Real Quiet was second last year. I think we're in a pretty good
spot right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm and Real Quiet parlayed second-place finishes here
into Kentucky Derby victories.
</P>
<P>
   Said Corey Nakatani, rider for Desert Hero: ``The other horse
was just in an easy gallop. But still, I thought we were going to
get him at any point. But the winner just kept on running, finding
another gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero, running his first race for new trainer Richard
Mandella, is also likely to travel to Churchill Downs for the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens will be there, and though he would not say if he's
committed to ride General Challenge, the veteran jockey left little
doubt where his heart lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious what my feelings are about this horse,''
he said. ``My biggest hope right now is that he just stays healthy
through the next month.''

INJURED STARS TUMBLE TO BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _The buzz coming into yesterday's game between the
Stars and the St. Louis Blues was about who was going to be playing
for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The difference turned out to be who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, flamboyant winger Brett Hull played his first game in St.
Louis since jumping from the Blues to the Stars through free agency
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Centers Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and Guy Carbonneau didn't
play, though, and therein lies the reason for the Blues' 5-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to use it as an excuse, but your No. 1, No.
2 and No. 3 centers ... '' said Hull, the implication obvious.
``You don't use it as an excuse, but as a challenge, and we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent injuries prevented Modano (groin), Nieuwendyk (knee) and
Carbonneau (ankle) from playing in Hull's welcome-back game, an
outing steeped in anticipation and short on delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Modano and Co. prevented the Stars from playing their
game.
</P>
<P>
   They struggled to generate any type of consistent offensive
threat. The most glaring evidence of the trio's absence was seen on
faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start with the puck,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said, ``and you're not going to win many games if you don't start
with the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   The times when a team is most likely to have the puck _ power
plays _ the Stars played as if they didn't want it.
</P>
<P>
   Hull described the power play as ``awful,'' with the 0-for-5
result as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``No shots, no aggressiveness,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor
explained. ``We had chances, and our power play has to come
through.'
</P>
<P>
   The problems, injury-based and otherwise, finally caught up to
the Stars in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner than Stars center Tony Hrkac had tied the score at 2-2
did the Blues add three goals in 10 minutes, including two by left
winger Pavol Demitra, who finished with two goals and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the way we needed to play to win,'' Hitchcock said,
``for two periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig: ``That's what happens when
you get down by a couple of goals, you start pinching, trying to
make something happen and there is a lot of room to look really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis seemed always to be playing with a lead. Each time,
the Stars scored to tie it, the Blues untied it.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues were up 1-0 when Hull scored his first goal at the
Kiel Center as a member of the visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   His goal had a certain style that defined his time in St. Louis.
He spun around to the side of the goal, faked as if he was going to
pass and instead slipped it past Blues goalie Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, like his presence, elicited a few boos and a
smattering of applause from the 20,113 fans in attendance. Mostly
though, fans greeted Hull with casual indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Hull had a much stronger reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first period, I could barely move,'' he said afterward.
``I was really nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   He had played in St. Louis for 11 seasons and looked forward to
playing against his former team in his former city on Nov. 21, but
was sidelined with a bruised kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he had to wait better than four months for his return.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too much time had passed. Maybe it's too close to the
playoffs. Maybe the Stars' uniform has come to look natural on him.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Hull's homecoming turned out to be about
who wasn't here instead of that he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play for the Blues anymore,'' Hull said.

STARS' LONG SEASON ENDS WITH SPICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know what you've always said, and I've never disagreed _ the
baseball season is simply too long.
</P>
<P>
   But we were both wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I got your looooong season right here:
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars are about to catch the Rangers, both going and
coming.
</P>
<P>
   The last time we saw the Rangers in Arlington, they were playing
for the right to win a world championship. Sorta.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were attempting to survive against the Yankees in
the opening round of the baseball playoffs. God apparently was not
pleased about such frivolous competition. He made it rain real
hard. A game that started on Oct. 2 ended in the wee hours of Oct.
3. In two days, the Rangers scored no runs and went home for the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the Stars started skating for the right to win a
world championship. The Stanley Cup, everyone predicted, was theirs
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, nothing has changed, except the Rangers open
another American League season tomorrow, and the Stars are still
killing time, waiting on the Stanley Cup playoffs. But there are
two weeks remaining in the NHL's regular season. Will it ever end?
</P>
<P>
   Being the best hasn't been a problem for the Stars thus far.
Definite proof, however, won't be available until the playoffs
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is our comfort level,'' said winger Pat (''Little
Ball of Hate'') Verbeek. ``With our record, we put ourselves in a
position of being comfortable at this point. That is both good and
bad. Lately, it's been bad. We haven't played with desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the Cowboys, none of the local Big Four has ever had
a better shot at winning a world championship. And it may be a long
while before the Cowboys are again considered title titans. The
Stars are our only hope.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the taskmaster, Ken Hitchcock has had this team
playoff-ready since February, but gliding through these next two
weeks is not exactly on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a blessing,'' Hitchcock said, ``that our remaining
schedule is as tough as it is. Detroit \Rtoday\S, Phoenix twice,
Colorado, Anaheim _ these are the kind of games when pride and
competitiveness take over. We need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Speak of a blessing, maybe it also wore a different disguise
last week when Mike Modano had to sit down. Something about a
pulled groin muscle. Modano will be out seven to 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fear this time of year centers on a key injury,''
said Hitchcock. ``But the time Mo will miss could mean renewed
energy when we need him the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk joined Modano on the injured-scratched list
yesterday when the Stars lost in St. Louis. Health is a current
team concern, but all the ailing will return for the start of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And in early April, the Stars will accept any kind of playoff
edge. Modano may have also figured, accidentally and painfully, in
another of those.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, he was leveled by Jeremy Roenick of Phoenix.
Roenick was slapped with a game misconduct for what the Stars
termed a ``cheap shot,'' but he was not suspended by the league.
</P>
<P>
   From some of us came a howl that the Stars didn't ignite a riot
after Modano took that hit in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what it did for that game was wake us up, and suddenly
Derian Hatcher took over, and we went on to win,'' said Hitchcock.
``It's also something that has not been forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the Stars will go back-to-back with Phoenix, playing
at Reunion on the 14th and there on the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Stars have an answer directed right at Roenick?
Locker-room talk suggests as much, but there might be more involved
here.
</P>
<P>
   A Coyotes-Stars playoff series is certainly a possibility. One
player didn't want to be quoted last week, his theory being why
talk about it publicly until it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are some teams you have a healthy hate for,'' he
added. ``You don't like them, but you respect them. Detroit and
Edmonton fall in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Roenick took that cheap shot, we didn't have much of a
rivalry with Phoenix. Now there's a hate. And it's not a healthy
hate. We don't like that team, and we don't respect that team.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice here, the sound of playoff gears starting to grind to
life.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball locally has gone and come, the hockey team awaits
the end of the longest season. And then the serious stuff can
start.

HOLDING THEIR BREATH FOR JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've become acquainted lately with breathlessness, with
exhaustion, with weakness. It has made me think of young Nicky
Contreraz, who died a tor turous death at the Arizona Boys Ranch
just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pneumonia has left me feeling loose and tangled as a puppet cut
away from his strings. And yet my trouble is nothing compared with
the infection that caused Contreraz to lose his breath, vomit con
stantly and suffer through uncontrolled diarrhea. And which
eventually left 2{ quarts of pus in the linings of his lungs for
the medical examiner to find.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one of the differences be tween us. Another is this:
</P>
<P>
   When I said I was sick, I was believed.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicky said he was sick, he was forced to do push-ups over a
bucket of his excrement-soiled clothing. He was re quired to eat
his supper while sitting on a toilet. He was ridiculed and
insulted, told he was a slacker who deserved an Acad emy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Then he died.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Pinal County prosecutors filed first-degree murder
charges against five Boys Ranch employees in connection with
Contreraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   The story disappeared under all the news of war in Kosovo, the
murder of a local police officer and the freak winter storm that
descended on the state. &QL; 
LOST COMMENTS
</P>
<P>
   With that story were lost the comments of lawyers working for
ranch employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutor doesn't know what's going on,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wonder if this is simply a response to aggressive
lawyers,'' added another. ``This is absolutely beyond real ity. No
one has ever thought that this was a first-degree murder case.''
</P>
<P>
   He's never spoken, I guess, to the fam ily of 15-year-old
Nicholaus Contreraz.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they live with themselves saying stuff like that,
defending people who did what they did to Nicky?'' asked Connie
Woodward, Contreraz's grand mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have children? Would they feel that way if someone did
this to their child?''
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of questions prose cutors will ask a jury _
and should ask a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz was in Boys Ranch because he'd gotten into trouble,
most recently for joy-riding in a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   The boot camp outside of Oracle was supposed to be a place where
discipline and hard work were used to straighten out wayward kids.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz wasn't straightened, however. He was broken. &UR; He had
been sick for days before he died. The nurse who saw him during
this time, and is one of those charged in his death, declared him
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But how could the others not have known he was ill?
</P>
<P>
   They've been around kids. Is it com mon for a youngster who's
``faking it'' to vomit constantly and defecate in his pants? Or
were they so bent on punish ment, on setting young Nicky straight,
that they ignored the obvious?
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing into the charges has been scheduled for
April 13. &QL; 
`GOT TO BE SOME JUSTICE'
</P>
<P>
   Among those who will be there are Contreraz's mother and
grandmother. They'll be making the trip from outside of Sacramento,
from which they sent Nicky to Arizona. And to which he was returned
in a box.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has got to be some justice somewhere in all this,''
Connie Wood ward said. ``Arizona must have laws against murder,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   It does. And they say if someone dies during the commission of a
felony _ like abusing a child _ the charge can be mur der in the
first degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Nicky in my sleep almost every night,'' Woodward said.
``I'll never forget the Friday before he died, talking to him, and
having the people at the ranch tell me, `Don't worry, you've got a
strong healthy young man here.' It haunts me.''
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict won't change that.
</P>
<P>
   It can't reverse the pain and the humili ation. It can't revive
a suffocated boy. But it might, at least in a small way, help his
tortured family breathe a little easier. &QL;

MABEES GET A SECOND CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA -- Thanks to General Challenge's powerful victory in
Saturday's Grade I Santa Anita Derby, owners John and Betty Mabee
figure to get another shot at the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Best Pal ran second at Churchill Downs for the Mabees in 1991
after finishing second to Dinard in the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert said that after General Challenge finished a
disappointing fifth in the Louisiana Derby last month, the gelding
became known as ``Rodman'' around the barn. They figured the real
General Challenge did not show up in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rodman shows up (in Kentucky), he'll be tough,'' John Mabee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the General Challenge camp also has another nickname for
their horse -- the `Paint Horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he stepped in a bucket of paint,'' Baffert said.
``He's got all that white.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Mabees have a lot more green stuff after Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gary Stevens does not think the Kentucky Derby distance of 1
1/4 miles will be a problem for General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a long, fluid stride, Stevens said of the strapping
son of General Meeting. `He feels like he will run all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Big Jag made it three consecutive victories when he won the
Grade II $200,000 Potrero Grande Breeders' Cup Handicap by a neck
over 21-1 longshot Early Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Big Jag, a 6-year-old gelding, ran the 6 1/2 furlongs on the
main track in 1:15 1/5 and returned $3.60 as the 4-5 favorite. Gold
Land was the official second-place finisher after Early Pioneer was
disqualified and placed fourth for interference at the top of the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse feels like a machine to me,'' said winning rider
Jose Valdivia. ``I've never been on one that can run the way he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The guaranteed $1 million Pick Six pool was $1,564,444. Five
of the six winners were favorites, and a winning ticket returned
$374.40.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Neil Drysdale-trained Sweet Life, ridden by Alex Solis,
rallied in the stretch to overtake pacesetter Lady At Peace and win
the $75,000 Providencia Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at 1 1/8
miles on the turf.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive victory for the daughter of Kris
S. and first stakes triumph. Sweet Life was the 2-1 favorite and
won by a head. Smittenby finished third.

BAFFERT HAS DECISIONS TO MAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ By saddling the first- and second-place finishers in
the Santa Anita Derby, Bob Baffert put a month of headaches behind
him _ and condemned himself to another.
</P>
<P>
   March was not the trainer's best month. An injury forced the
abrupt retirement of once top-ranked 3-year-old Exploit. Two other
Kentucky Derby hopefuls, General Challenge and Straight Man,
suffered their first losses. Silver Charm, the 1997 Derby winner,
ran up the track in Dubai, and Real Quiet, the '98 Derby winner,
was withdrawn from a major race in Arkansas. A shouting match with
a jockey agent over riding assignments led to Baffert shoving the
man _ and left the impression he was cracking under all that bad
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person I know of who had a worse week than I had was
Coach K,'' Baffert said more than once in recent days, referring to
Mike Krzyzewski, coach of NCAA final loser Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at about noon Friday, Baffert discovered that new
top-ranked 3-year-old Prime Timber had a tender hind foot and might
have to be scratched from the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that after the big performances by General Challenge
and Prime Timber in the West's major Kentucky Derby prep race
Saturday, Baffert pleaded for a few hours to savor the victory
before being forced to think about what's next.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Baffert's chances of winning a record third straight
Run for the Roses on May 1 look outstanding again.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the Santa Anita Derby, his 3-year-old filly
Excellent Meeting trounced a weak field in the Fantasy Stakes at
Oaklawn Park in Arkansas. An hour before the Santa Anita Derby, his
(begin ital)other(end ital) 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday ran
away with the Ashland Stakes at Keeneland in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Santa Anita race right before the Derby, Baffert's
colt Finder's Gold dominated an allowance race to put himself back
on the road to Churchill Downs _ or at least the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenge for Baffert is to pick his team for the
Kentucky Derby, a team that will include at least two horses or as
many as ...?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty!'' Baffert said with aplomb when he was asked how many
horses he could conceive of entering in a Kentucky Derby. Twenty is
the Derby limit.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Baffert can choose from among six 3-year-olds,
assuming they all stay healthy and train well. General Challenge:
He's confirmed on an April 13 flight to Louisville after Saturday's
3 {-length victory, the California-bred gelding's first race since
he was fitted with blinkers to improve his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he focused all of his energy in the right direction when
he got to the starting gate,'' jockey Gary Stevens said of the
high-spirited horse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, composure comes easier with 33,551 fans behind the
rail. Let's see how he handles the Churchill Downs crowd of
140,000-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber: He'll be on that flight too, and his fans
shouldn't be discouraged by Saturday's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   With a slow early pace working against them, Prime Timber and
David Flores were able to rally from fifth to second in the last
three-eighths of a mile. The effort looked even stronger half an
hour later, when Baffert revealed he feared he'd have to scratch
the colt because of the sore foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have stepped on something. He was noticeably off in
the back (left) leg,'' Baffert said. But the trainer's staff
removed the shoe and treated the foot overnight. Whatever they did
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really going to set him up (for the Kentucky Derby).
He ran the same race Real Quiet did last year,'' Baffert said. As
Real Quiet did, Prime Timber and General Challenge covered the
final eighth of a mile in about 12 3/5 seconds, which says good
things about their chances at 1 \ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Straight Man: Already in Kentucky, Bob and Beverly Lewis'
talented but underseasoned colt might run April 18 in Keeneland's
Lexington Stakes, a back door to the Derby. Baffert wishes he had
another month to prepare him.
</P>
<P>
   Straight Man seems unlikely to be pushed into the Derby if
Baffert has other horses. Which he will.
</P>
<P>
   Finder's Gold: Saturday's win probably was too little, too late,
to get him to Louisville. His breeders and owners, John and Betty
Mabee of San Diego, also have General Challenge and Excellent
Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday: Now the hard part: The champion 2-year-old
filly of 1998 has done enough to merit a Derby try in an average
year. But owner Mike Pegram has already won a Derby with Real Quiet
and would settle for the Kentucky Oaks _ the fillies' Derby _ the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting: Now the harder part: Would the Mabees rather
have two shots at the Derby _ with General Challenge !ital!and!off
Excellent Meeting _ or one shot at the Derby and one at the Oaks?
</P>
<P>
   Mabee indicated that unless something goes wrong with General
Challenge, the filly is bound for the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   This is the remarkable statistic on Baffert's Santa Anita Derby
success: In the past four years, he has won the race three times,
and finished first or second with six different horses, who
competed in the colors of six different owners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Baffert can keep all of his 3-year-olds healthy and pick
the right race for each, he'll keep all of his owners happy.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he won't finalize any decisions until the week of
the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' he said, ``the few dark hairs I have on the back of
my neck are going to be white after the next few weeks.''

BEHRENS CAPTURES OAKLAWN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. _ In the absence of Real Quiet, Behrens made a
lot of noise.
</P>
<P>
   With his impressive victory in yesterday's $750,000 Oaklawn
Handicap, the 5-year-old at once exorcised two past demons:
inconsistency and misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Ridden by Jorge Chavez, Behrens overpowered pacesetting
runner-up Littlebitlively in the last furlong of the sloppy Oaklawn
Park race to win by 2 1/2 lengths in a fast 1:47.77 for a mile and
an eighth. It was the second such performance in a row for the
5-year-old, who also won the Gulfstream Park Handicap last month.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens had been expected to face Real Quiet, last year's
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner. But Real Quiet's trainer, Bob
Baffert, abruptly changed course earlier this week and stayed in
California because of displeasure over the handicap weights, which
had Real Quiet spotting Behrens 6 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It would have taken a big effort for any horse to beat Behrens
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him do what he wanted to do,'' said Chavez, and Behrens
clearly wanted to run.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens stayed within two lengths of Littlebitlively through
swift early fractions of 46.29 seconds for a half-mile and 1:09.90
for six furlongs. He drew abreast of Littlebitlively entering the
lane and pulled away convincingly with only minimal encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, owned by Bill Clifton Jr. of Waco _ a longtime Oaklawn
regular _ and Don and Anne Rudder of Avon, Conn., paid $5 as the
slight favorite. Littlebitlively finished 1 3/4 lengths ahead of
third-place stablemate Precocity, the defending race champion who
rallied from last place on a track drenched by mid-afternoon
thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr Fong, the second favorite, was a well-beaten fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Luck, originally part of a three-horse entry owned by
John Franks and trained by Bobby Barnett, was a late scratch.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Behrens would follow a good race with a terrible
one, and often behaved erratically as well. But since a hairline
fracture in his hock was discovered and surgically corrected, he
has been a model racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year ``was a disaster,'' trainer Jimmy Bond said. ``But
now, he has come back and we have something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, beaten by a nose on a sloppy track in the 1997 Travers
Stakes, has won six races from only 15 lifetime starts, and has
earned $1,839,000. As a young horse, he had bone chips removed from
a leg, and he carries a screw inserted into his injured hock last
summer that obviously is causing him no discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   The next start for Behrens, Bond said, could be the May 29
Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs, which like the Oaklawn
Handicap, is part of the 12-race NTRA Champions on Fox series for
older horses. Behrens picked up 10 points in the series standings
for winning yesterday, and holds a 22-20 edge over Free House and
Puerto Madero.

FORMER COUNTRY DAY STAR RACES TO 100 WIN IN 10.11
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The television was working late into the night at Amar
Johnson's place. And the show was spellbinding.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the former Fort Worth Country Day star and current
freshman sensation for the Texas Longhorns, spent a long evening
watching videotapes of his No. 1 opponent in yesterday's Texas
Relays invitational 100 meter dash, two-time Olympic gold medalist
Mike Marsh. He studied Marsh's start, his technique, anything that
might give him an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the World Championships in 1995 and '97, the
Olympics in '92 and '96, the Goodwill Games ... everything I could
get my hands on,'' Johnson said. ``I learned I would have to get
out fast. If you don't get out to a fast start against him, he'll
get you.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get Johnson yesterday at Mike A. Myers Stadium, as the
19-year-old Longhorn got off to what he called ``the best start of
my life'' and blew away the 31-year-old Marsh with a time of 10.11
seconds, the best college time in America this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear freshmen say they want to run fast later,'' said
Johnson, who beat Marsh by .03 seconds. ``I said, `No, I want to do
it now.' Nobody believed in me except my teammates. Nobody even
knows who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000-plus fans who packed Texas' new track facility
yesterday found out when Johnson, running on the far outside in
Lane 9, shot out in front early and never gave an inch. His time
was by far a personal best, surpassing the 10.28 he ran two weeks
ago, and automatically qualified him for the NCAA outdoor
championships June 2-5 in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   It also broke the Johnson family record, previously held by
Amar's father, Robert, who ran 10.18 at Northeast Louisiana in the
1980s. Amar said his father was among the many who had counseled
him in preparation for yesterday's race, along with Texas coach
Bubba Thornton and world record holder Donovan Bailey, who trains
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Donovan I was going try his approach,'' Johnson said.
``He doesn't start well, but he comes on at the end. He said,
`Don't do that.' Get out fast. Get out low and keep driving.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson caused the biggest stir, TCU's sprinters were also
dazzling, running a 38.64 to win the University men's 4x100-meter
relay. Despite a sloppy baton exchange between leadoff man Bryan
Howard and Jarmiene Holloway, the Horned Frogs still cruised to an
easy victory in the nation's best time of the young outdoor season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, TCU's Lindel Frater, Ricardo ``Flash'' Williams and
Holloway swept the first three places in the University men's 100,
running 10.20, 10.21 and 10.23, respectively. Howard ran 10.21 to
finish third in the invitational 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all equal,'' said Frater, a sophomore from Jamaica.
``And because of that, we have a great relationship. It's like
we're all in one head, because we think a lot alike. And mostly
what we think is that we've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   UT-Arlington's Marsha French did her job yesterday, winning the
women's shot put with a national-best throw of 53-9 3/4, good
enough to automatically qualify her for the NCAA meet. The junior
transfer from Northeast Louisiana has now set personal bests in her
past two meets since changing her form to gain extra momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out here expecting to throw a personal best, not to
win,'' she said. ``I've worked so hard for this. I've had the
potential all along. I just needed to show people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin All-Stars felt they had something to prove in the
invitational 4x100 and 4x200 relays, mostly because they were
matched up against an HSI team that featured reigning world
champions Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon and former world champ Jon
Drummond.
</P>
<P>
   But former UT-El Paso star Obadele Thompson gave the All-Stars
an early lead over Drummond and HSI in both races, and anchor
Rohsaan Griffith took it from there, holding off Curtis Perry in
the 4x100 and Greene in the 4x200 to give his team a pair of
stunning victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who it is, I'm not going to let the race get away
when I'm on top,'' Griffith said. ``I know they wanted these bad,
especially the 4x200 after we'd already beaten them in the 4x100.
But our sprinters are just as good as theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas sprinters proved they were the best in the women's
division, winning all three relays yesterday _ all in meet record
time. The Longhorns' 42.90 in the 4x100 and 3:28.48 in the 4x400
were national bests.

RANGERS SEND MATEO, ZIMMERMAN TO TRIPLE A
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Outfielder Ruben Mateo and pitcher Jeff
Zimmerman were the most impressive rookies in the Rangers' spring
camp, but it wasn't enough to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Both, as expected, were sent to Triple-A Oklahoma when the
Rangers finalized their 25-man roster yesterday before a 6-4
exhibition loss to the New York Mets at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates looked for ways during the final days of
spring training to get Mateo on the roster but came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an organizational decision on Ruben Mateo,'' Oates
said. ``A lot of discussion went into it. The decision was based
not only on what's best for Ruben but what's best for the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The big winners yesterday were outfielder Scarborough Green and
infielder Jon Shave, who won the final two roster spots. Green beat
out Milt Cuyler as the fifth outfielder and pinch-runner, and Shave
beat out Scott Sheldon and Rafael Bournigal as the second utility
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively I thought they were all alike and Shave had the
best spring offensively,'' Oates said. ``Im my mind, Shave won the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo hit .283 with four homers and 11 runs batted in in 53
at-bats, but the Rangers are set with Tom Goodwin in center. Mateo
could platoon with Lee Stevens at designated hitter when Rafael
Palmeiro is ready to play first but the Rangers want him playing
every day at Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo and Zimmerman were being kept around in case Palmeiro and
pitcher John Wetteland would not be ready for Opening Day. But
Palmeiro and Wetteland continue to show that they are close to
overcoming spring training health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, slowed by an ankle problem this spring, retired the
side in order yesterday in his one inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concerns were done two outings ago,'' Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' pitching coach Dick Bosman said.
``Physically he feels good. He trains well. What he did this winter
in getting his arm ready sustained him to get through the other
thing. Now that's under control, his arm is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who underwent two knee surgeries in the past two
months, had two singles in four at-bats yesterday. He was 4-for-11
with a home run in three exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' Palmeiro said. ``I'll take it. I've done
better, but you don't get to that locked zone for a long time.
Hopefully I can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's long shot bid to make the team seemed to fade when
he allowed five runs in his last four appearances. He gave up three
runs in his first 10 innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   But Oates said a bigger factor was taking two left-handers _
Eric Gunderson and Mike Munoz _ a long reliever _ either Esteban
Loaiza or Mike Morgan _ who could pitch a high number of innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimmerman threw the ball well for me all spring,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers treated me great,'' Zimmerman said. ``I thought I
proved I could get big-league hitters out. Now I just need to go
down there and work on a few things and be ready if something opens
up this summer.''

FOR BETTER OR WORSE, RANGERS PITCHING STAFF SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Curt Schilling isn't going to ride to the
rescue. The Rangers set their 11-man pitching staff for Opening Day
yesterday and expect to stay with it for a while.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff had a 5.51 earned-run average, with opponents
hitting .301.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan won the fifth spot in the rotation with a 1.53 ERA.
Esteban Loaiza lost it with an 8.09 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' front three starters of Rick Helling, Aaron Sele
and Mark Clark were 7-4 with a 5.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett finished the spring 1-3 with a 6.26 ERA after
allowing five runs (only two earned) in four innings yesterday.
Opponents hit .299.
</P>
<P>
   The setup relievers of left-handers Mike Munoz and Eric
Gunderson and right-handers Danny Patterson and Tim Crabtree
combined for a 5.19 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all done the work; they've done their preparation and
largely they've executed,'' pitching coach Dick Bosman said.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE SUITS
</P>
<P>
   A Ballpark in Arlington landmark is gone. The Rangers replaced
the 501-foot, ``Hit it Here, Win Free Suit'' sign on top of the
right-field roof.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' two lefthanded power-hitters weren't too distressed
considering nobody has yet to hit a ball on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stand on second base and hit it that far,'' Rafael
Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if they had Mark McGwire around,'' Lee Stevens said.
``They have a new Sonic sign in the bullpen. It seems a lot of my
home runs go into the bullpen. Maybe if I hit the Sonic sign I'll
win a week's supply of Coney Dogs and limeade.''
MORGAN SETS RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan is going into the record books, 21 years after
making his major-league debut with the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers officially added Morgan to their roster yesterday,
the 11th team he has played with in his career. That's one more
than reliever Bob Miller, outfielder Tommy Davis and pitcher Ken
Brett.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, 39, was 18 when he pitched in his first major-league
game with Oakland in 1978. Since then he has played with the
Yankees, Blue Jays, Mariners, Orioles, Dodgers, Cubs, Cardinals,
Reds, Twins and Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   EVANS DESIGNATED
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Tom Evans was designated for assignment yesterday,
one day after being claimed on waivers from the Toronto Blue Jays.
The Rangers are hoping to get him through waivers and send him to
Triple A Oklahoma.
INJURY REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore was out of the lineup yesterday
with a slightly strained left hamstring muscle. His absence was a
precautionary measure and he said he would be ready for Opening
Day.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays on outfielder Ruben Mateo's right wrist showed no
fractures or other serious problems. The diagnosis is a bone bruise
and he is available to play when he joins Oklahoma.
METS 6, RANGERS 4
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored five runs off Rangers starter John Burkett in
four innings. The Rangers finished the spring with a 14-14 record.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate: Ivan Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez and Rusty Greer were
a combined 5 for 10 yesterday and together hit .413 for the spring,
with 10 homers and 38 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound: Mike Morgan had two more scoreless innings
yesterday and finished the spring with a 1.53 ERA, the lowest on
the club.
</P>
<P>
   In the field: Gonzalez dropped Brian McRae's fly ball in the
fourth inning, a three-base error that led to a four-run inning for
the Mets. Three of the four runs off pitcher John Burkett were
unearned.
</P>
<P>
   On the basepaths: Scarborough Green, who made the team primarily
as a pinch-runner, got picked off in the sixth inning by reliever
Scott Stewart and thrown out in the eighth trying to steal. He
would have been safe but he elected not to slide and was tagged out
when his foot dragged off the base.

BUSINESSWOMAN WITH TIES TO CHINA WIELDS INFLUENCE, MAKES CONTACTS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Mann, Arizona's most important business connection to
Beijing, has risen to prominence through mastery of what the
Chinese call ``guanxi,'' the cultivation of contacts with powerful
people.
</P>
<P>
   Educated in the United States and China and fluent in the
languages and cultures of both countries, Mann personifies the
energetic and growing Chinese business presence in the U.S., which
has seen hundreds of Chinese companies set up operations here.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Mann's contacts have been linked to major scandals.
Another was convicted of bank fraud in Georgia before coming to
work for Mann. She herself has been the subject of two criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, 46, was known as Ning Yu before she became a U.S. citizen
in 1992. She is the top executive in Arizona for COFCO, a corporate
giant owned by the Beijing government. It owns the COFCO Chinese
Cultural Center on 44th Street north of Van Buren street in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Until the cultural center's grand opening in December, Mann, a
trim, hard-driving resident of northeast Phoenix, had maintained a
low profile in her adopted land. But her circle of financial
influence has included:
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese vice president's son who became a central figure in
the still-swirling allegations that President Clinton sold access
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A former colonel in the People's Liberation Army who was
indicted in the United States in 1996 on weapons smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
   A business partner at COFCO's lending arm who came to Arizona
after criminal violations at an Atlanta bank led federal
authorities to ban him from banking.
</P>
<P>
   An officer at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing who repeatedly
violated State Department rules by accepting favors from Mann while
he provided visa assistance for her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy in her associates' pasts, Mann has drawn
praise from community leaders for her role in establishing the
cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix City Councilman Cody Williams, whose district includes
the center, called Mann ``an astute, assertive, charismatic
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a clear vision and she brought it to fruition,''
Williams said, referring to the center. ``It's an architectural
masterpiece in the middle of the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's family has also achieved success here. Husband Frederic,
also a native of China, is a real estate broker and businessman.
Their son, Henry, a senior at Horizon High School, has been
nominated to the Naval Academy by U.S. Sen. John McCain and to the
Air Force Academy by U.S. Rep. John Shadegg.
</P>
<P>
   Mann was born and raised in Nanjing. She came to Arizona in the
early 1980s to study at Thunderbird, the American Graduate School
of International Management.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, she worked as an analyst for Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.
in Indiana, studied international trade at Penn State University
and returned to Arizona in 1987 to accept an offer from Ambanc, a
Phoenix investment company.
</P>
<P>
   Her job was to find Chinese investors for partnerships that
bought apartments and other properties in several Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a marketing person,'' Mann said. ``I developed contacts
with potential clients and brought them to the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the investors Mann brought to Ambanc would become central
figures in scandals that strained relations between Washington and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Wang Jun, the son of Wang Zhen, vice president of
China from 1988 until his death in 1993. A ``New York Times''
obituary described Wang Zhen as ``a general who rose through the
Communist ranks to become one of China's most powerful leaders and
among the hardest of the hard-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Wang Jun became a controversial figure after he met
with President Clinton at a White House reception for political
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's visit caused a furor, not only because of his political
pedigree, but because it was arranged by Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie,
a Little Rock businessman at the center of allegations that the
Chinese tried to use campaign contributions to influence U.S.
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics suggested that Wang had bought access to the
White House, and Clinton later acknowledged that the visit had been
``clearly inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang is the head of the Chinese International Trust and
Investment Corp., or CITIC. It is China's most powerful financial
and industrial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Mann had no ties to the White House controversy. She had
arranged for Ambanc President Jack McDonnell to meet Wang eight
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The two men soon discovered that they shared a love for golf. As
they played the course at Scottsdale's Gainey Ranch, they discussed
business, McDonnell recalled. &UR; Soon, CITIC joined the Phoenix
company in a series of partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   CITIC bought into Ambanc partnerships that purchased an office
building at the Scottsdale Air Park, the Cedar Meadows Apartments
in Peoria, 1,200 acres of undeveloped land in Sun Valley west of
Phoenix and 143 acres at Goldfield Ranch east of Fountain Hills.
Cedar Meadows has since been sold.
</P>
<P>
   CITIC was one of several Chinese corporations that Mann brought
into Ambanc investments. Another, property records show, was
Polytechnologies, a business arm of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a Polytechnologies subsidiary called Dynasty Holdings
became Ambanc's limited partner on apartment complexes in Norwalk,
Calif., and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Those investments, according to McDonnell, were guided by Robert
Ma, a Dynasty executive and a former Chinese army colonel who was
indicted in 1996 on federal charges of smuggling 2,000 AK-47 rifles
into California. Ma fled the country before he could be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors provided startling details about the smuggling ring
and said the rifles were destined for U.S. street gangs. Even more
ominous was their claim that the smugglers had offered to sell
rocket launchers, anti-aircraft missiles, machine guns and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Mann downplayed Ma's role in the People's Liberation Army deals
with Ambanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Mr. Ma, it's the company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As to her role in attracting the Chinese investors, she said,
``I promoted Phoenix, and I helped to promote the Phoenix
opportunities. But it wasn't just me. I wouldn't take all the
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wang and Ma were the two most controversial Chinese who
participated in Ambanc deals, there were other prominent Chinese
who were drawn to Arizona through Mann's contacts.
</P>
<P>
   One was Andong Zhong, son of the finance minister for China's
``paramount leader,'' the late Deng Xiaoping. Andong directed the
firm's entry into the Ambanc partnership that owned the Cedar
Meadows apartments for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Another was Deng Zhifang, a son of Deng Xiaoping. He worked
briefly at Ambanc's office on Tatum Boulevard in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``He tried to sell some deals for us, but nothing came of it,''
McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, after becoming a U.S. citizen, Mann went to work for
COFCO, becoming president of the Phoenix subsidiary whose name,
BNU, adorns the license plate of her green Mercedes. BNU stands for
Beijing and the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   BNU manages the cultural center and Chinese-owned real estate in
Phoenix and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It owns three shoe factories in China, and a subsidiary named
COFCO Credit provides automobile loans in Arizona and other Western
states.
</P>
<P>
   Records filed with the Arizona Corporation Commission show that
Mann owns 24 percent of COFCO Credit. Mann said there is nothing
unusual about a government corporation sharing ownership with its
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my incentive from COFCO,'' she said. ``I built this
company for them, and I think they are very appreciative of what I
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, however, government investigators in Arizona
were focusing more critical attention on some of Mann's ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Justice Department lawyers informed Mann that
she was ``a target of a grand jury investigation'' in Arizona based
on evidence that she had failed to report income by using ``foreign
bank accounts opened in the name of fictitious offshore entities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann said the Justice Department later informed her that the
investigation into her finances had been terminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``It was totally dissolved the same year,'' she said. ``There
was nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Mann's partner in COFCO Credit is Jack Gray, a Texas native and
former New York investment banker who pleaded guilty in 1985 to two
criminal violations of federal banking conflict of interest laws.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was ordered to pay restitution of $154,000 as well as a
$100,000 fine, the largest fine the U.S. Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency had ever assessed.
</P>
<P>
   He was also banned for life from being an officer of a federally
insured bank.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, who lives in Paradise Valley, did not return phone calls.
Mann defended him, saying he made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot do banking again,'' she said. ``But his knowledge of
banking is what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray and Mann's husband teamed up in 1993 on a pair &UR; of property
transactions that brought them a handsome profit.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day they bought undeveloped land near Sky Harbor
International Airport, they sold it to a group of investors from
the Chinese city of Zhenjiang at a $385,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   But it was another real estate deal that drew the attention of
the state grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction began in late 1994, when the Manns established
Vista Capital Management to buy the cultural center site on 44th
Street, just south of Loop 202.
</P>
<P>
   The Manns planned to buy the land for $3.6 million and sell it
to BNU for $6 million, records show. But before the deal could
close, a Mann subordinate named Jianwei Ding became suspicious and
hired attorneys to look into it on behalf of BNU.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, 1996, five days before the double transaction was to
close, one of the attorneys reported his suspicion that Elizabeth
Mann had devised a ``scheme for personal profit'' and had
``breached her fiduciary duty'' to BNU.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney alerted Arizona Assistant Attorney General Michael
C. Cudahy, who examined the records and launched a grand jury
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that BNU . . . is a victim of the possible criminal
activity by Mr. and Mrs. Mann,'' Cudahy wrote in a letter to the
Manns' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Mann defended the deal, saying it had been arranged
because of concern that the seller would raise the price if it knew
COFCO was behind it. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   She said COFCO officials in China had approved the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to be a very quiet buyer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of the controversy, the Manns canceled the deal,
even though they had locked in the $3.6 million price. BNU bought
the property directly for $3.6 million. Frederic Mann received one
commission on the deal, instead of the two commissions called for
under the double escrow.
</P>
<P>
   With no deal to probe, Cudahy canceled the state's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Mann's contacts have reached into the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing. As ``The Arizona Republic'' reported last week, the man
who directed the embassy's visa section repeatedly violated State
Department rules by accepting Mann's offer of free use of
COFCO-owned apartments in Las Vegas and Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Mann denies impropriety in her ties to Charles Parish, visa
officer at the Beijing embassy from 1994 to 1996. Speaking of
Parish's visits to COFCO's offices in Phoenix, she said, ``We want
to promote Phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parish acknowledges the appearance of a conflict of interest
between his official duties and his relationship with a corporate
executive who sought visas from his office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversies, Mann remains enthusiastic and
determined.
</P>
<P>
   She has set a course for ambitious COFCO expansion. At the
cultural center's grand opening, Mann said the center would be the
model for similar developments across the country. She also
interpreted for COFCO President Zhou Mingchen, who called for
closer Sino-U.S. business and cultural ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these two countries can really join hands together,'' Zhou
said, ``it will be a great force that will help the 21st
century.'' &QL;

NATO PREPARES 8,000 TROOPS FOR ALBANIAN RELIEF
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO said Saturday it would send as many as 8,000
troops to Albania to contend with what an alliance spokesman called
a ``demographic earthquake'' caused by the flood of refugees being
driven out of Kosovo by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb blasts rocked the outskirts of Belgrade again early today.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.S. officials said, however, there was still no
consideration of introducing ground forces to fight their way into
the Serbian province, where the troops of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic have been attacking ethnic Albanians and herding
them out toward the borders.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of exodus, ``Serb security forces would have
more or less emptied Kosovo'' in 10 to 20 days, said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, in Europe to
review the worsening humanitarian disaster for President Clinton,
was prepared to implore Macedonia to reopen its northern border
with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in Macedonia, which has absorbed an estimated
55,000 refugees in recent weeks, are concerned that the influx
could upset the delicate ethnic balance of the small nation.
Approximately 25,000 more ethnic Albanians were waiting to stream
across, aid workers said.
</P>
<P>
   New NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia were hampered by a thick cloud
cover over the Balkans Saturday, but a cruise missile slammed into
a second bridge over the Danube River near Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   Early today, Agence France-Presse news service quoted an
official Yugoslav source as saying a police academy and an oil
refinery near Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, had been hit. Reuters
said a fuel dump at Kraljevo, in southern Serbia, had also been a
target. NATO did not immediately confirm the strikes. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Belgrade, Serbians reacted with defiance as they viewed the
ruins of two government buildings struck early Saturday and
destroyed by NATO cruise missiles. Vlajko Stojijkovic, the Serbian
interior minister, said the attacks were ``acts of a monster
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air commander David Wilby said: ``Our attack went well.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they had no news of the three U.S. Army
soldiers who were picked up by Serb forces Wednesday on the
Kosovo-Macedonia border and may face Yugoslav court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have any new information,'' said Navy Capt. Steve
Pietropaoli, a Pentagon spokesman. ``We have heard some assurances
from the Yugoslav government'' that the three soldiers are being
well cared for, he said. ``We didn't see much reassurance out of
the pictures that were shown on TV of those soldiers. We expect
them to be released immediately.``
</P>
<P>
   The three detainees are Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville;
Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; and Staff Sgt.
Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remembered the soldiers in his Easter eve radio address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us keep in our prayers the three brave American servicemen
now being held without justification in Belgrade, that they may
return to us soon,'' Clinton said. ``Let us do what we can and what
we must for peace to prevail and let us stay the course until it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, spokesman Jamie Shea
said that allied ambassadors had asked U.S. Army General Wesley
Clark, the alliance's military chief, to quickly ship an
operational headquarters, helicopters, supplies and troops to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is mobilizing all its available resources for this urgent
humanitarian requirement,'' Shea said. ``The focus of the alliance
is still very, very much on the demographic earthquake that we are
experiencing in and around Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea also said that more of some 10,000 British, French and
German troops _ originally sent to Macedonia for a prospective
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo _ have been ordered to work with the
refugee crisis there.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding refugee crisis appeared to force NATO to
reconsider its terms of peace with Milosevic. Although allied and
U.S. spokesmen said the cease-fire proposal put forward in France
last month remained on the table, there were signs NATO was
prepared to insist that Milosevic take additional steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly President Milosevic has shown that he is not the best
person to govern Kosovo after the actions of the recent days,''
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Milosevic could not be
allowed to present ``some plan to salvage what he can from this and
present himself as a peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Without addressing any possible new peace formulation, Clinton,
in his radio address, called for steadfastness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation cannot do everything,'' Clinton said. ``We can't
end all suffering. We can't stop all violence, but there are times
when looking away simply is not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military mission in Kosovo is a difficult and dangerous
one, but it's necessary and right and we must stand with all our
NATO allies to see it through.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican response, Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, a
former NATO counter-intelligence officer, questioned whether
Clinton himself had the resolve to stick with the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interests abroad cannot be defended without a clear
understanding of what our aims are and without a careful plan for
bringing our military might to bear upon an achievable objective,''
Gilmore said. ``This is one of the most simple tests of leadership.
This is a test that I hope President Clinton will pass, but I fear
he won't.''
</P>
<P>
   A new Newsweek poll found that 83 percent of Americans would
support sending U.S. forces to rescue the U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Support for using ground forces in the Balkan fighting now
commands a majority of support, the survey showed, measured at 54
percent, compared with 47 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, based on interviews with 750 adults on Thursday and
Friday, had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of Britons being published in today's Sunday Times showed
even stronger support for using ground troops in Kosovo: 66 percent
in favor and 27 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said ground troops were ``not a panacea either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They would take time to find, to raise, to deploy, and we
don't have that time, quite frankly, in order to do what we can to
arrest the current humanitarian situation in Kosovo,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Blair, conferring by telephone Saturday, said the
missile attacks on the Serb and Yugoslav interior ministries had
sent ``a powerful message'' of NATO's resolve. The nearby buildings
are the headquarters of the police units believed to be planning
attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some allied officials conceded that the ministry staffs almost
certainly had been moved out, but Air Commodore Wilby, of the
British Royal Air Force, said that even if the buildings were
empty, the attack showed ``we have moved our thinking process and
our striking process up to the heart of the matter. And we have
shown that we can prosecute our attacks right in the heart, in the
nerve center, where all this began.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilby said, however, that the cloud cover _ going up to 30,000
feet _ continued to limit aerial bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the weather improvement in the Balkans area has
yet to materialize, and we were hampered in our efforts to mount
operations by manned aircraft,'' Wilby said. ``It seems that the
weather has proved to be a temporary ally of President Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In other humanitarian developments, an Air Force C-17 cargo
plane flew from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware Saturday with
30,000 packaged meals destined for Kosovar refugees, Defense
Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said each packet contains enough food to feed one refugee
for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about 2,200 calories and it is non-meat, so it can be
eaten by people of all faiths,'' Bacon said. Most of the Kosovar
Albanians are Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Additional U.S. military planes were dispatched with unloading
equipment and airport operations gear to help control the
increasing traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright conferred by telephone
Saturday with the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and
Britain about potential threats by Milosevic against Montenegro,
which along with Serbia makes up what is currently known as
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said the officials
``warned that any effort of the Belgrade regime to undermine the
democratic government of the Republic of Montenegro could have the
most serious consequences.''

HOLDING THEIR BREATH FOR JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've become acquainted lately with breathlessness, with
exhaustion, with weakness. It has made me think of young Nicky
Contreraz, who died a tor turous death at the Arizona Boys Ranch
just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pneumonia has left me feeling loose and tangled as a puppet cut
away from his strings. And yet my trouble is nothing compared with
the infection that caused Contreraz to lose his breath, vomit con
stantly and suffer through uncontrolled diarrhea. And which
eventually left 2{ quarts of pus in the linings of his lungs for
the medical examiner to find.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one of the differences be tween us. Another is this:
</P>
<P>
   When I said I was sick, I was believed.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicky said he was sick, he was forced to do push-ups over a
bucket of his excrement-soiled clothing. He was re quired to eat
his supper while sitting on a toilet. He was ridiculed and
insulted, told he was a slacker who deserved an Acad emy Award.
</P>
<P>
   Then he died.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Pinal County prosecutors filed first-degree murder
charges against five Boys Ranch employees in connection with
Contreraz's death.
</P>
<P>
   The story disappeared under all the news of war in Kosovo, the
murder of a local police officer and the freak winter storm that
descended on the state. &QL; 
LOST COMMENTS
</P>
<P>
   With that story were lost the comments of lawyers working for
ranch employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecutor doesn't know what's going on,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wonder if this is simply a response to aggressive
lawyers,'' added another. ``This is absolutely beyond real ity. No
one has ever thought that this was a first-degree murder case.''
</P>
<P>
   He's never spoken, I guess, to the fam ily of 15-year-old
Nicholaus Contreraz.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they live with themselves saying stuff like that,
defending people who did what they did to Nicky?'' asked Connie
Woodward, Contreraz's grand mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have children? Would they feel that way if someone did
this to their child?''
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of questions prose cutors will ask a jury _
and should ask a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz was in Boys Ranch because he'd gotten into trouble,
most recently for joy-riding in a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   The boot camp outside of Oracle was supposed to be a place where
discipline and hard work were used to straighten out wayward kids.
</P>
<P>
   Contreraz wasn't straightened, however. He was broken. &UR; He had
been sick for days before he died. The nurse who saw him during
this time, and is one of those charged in his death, declared him
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But how could the others not have known he was ill?
</P>
<P>
   They've been around kids. Is it com mon for a youngster who's
``faking it'' to vomit constantly and defecate in his pants? Or
were they so bent on punish ment, on setting young Nicky straight,
that they ignored the obvious?
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing into the charges has been scheduled for
April 13. &QL; 
`GOT TO BE SOME JUSTICE'
</P>
<P>
   Among those who will be there are Contreraz's mother and
grandmother. They'll be making the trip from outside of Sacramento,
from which they sent Nicky to Arizona. And to which he was returned
in a box.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has got to be some justice somewhere in all this,''
Connie Wood ward said. ``Arizona must have laws against murder,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   It does. And they say if someone dies during the commission of a
felony _ like abusing a child _ the charge can be mur der in the
first degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Nicky in my sleep almost every night,'' Woodward said.
``I'll never forget the Friday before he died, talking to him, and
having the people at the ranch tell me, `Don't worry, you've got a
strong healthy young man here.' It haunts me.''
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict won't change that.
</P>
<P>
   It can't reverse the pain and the humili ation. It can't revive
a suffocated boy. But it might, at least in a small way, help his
tortured family breathe a little easier. &QL;

USC DEFEATS NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first inning and the game-tying runner that
was caught stealing. Take those away and the Cal State Northridge
baseball team might have earned a win against its nationally ranked
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Matadors fell three game below .500 with an 11-6
loss to USC on Saturday at Matador Field, completing the Trojans'
three-game sweep of the nonconference series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the exact same thing,'' CSUN starter Jim DeBiase said,
referring to Friday's doubleheader in which the Matadors gave up a
significant lead early in the game before staging a comeback. ``But
like I said, (USC) is a great hitting team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our adrenaline kind of kicks us back. We have some battlers on
this team, though. They don't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors (20-23) drew within one with a six-run seventh. The
tying run was on second with no outs, but Dan Phillips was thrown
out attempting to steal third while Eric Horvat struck out. The
next batter, Jeremy Sickles, also struck out to end the inning with
a 7-6 USC lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Patrick led off the CSUN seventh with a double and ended
Trojans starter Justin Lehr's shutout by scoring two batters later
on a single up the middle by Mike Bumstead. Lehr (4-1) was removed
after forcing in a run with a walk to Tim Arroyo. The second error
of the inning by USC second baseman Dominic Correa brought in two
runs and put runners at the corners with no outs. Six consecutive
Matadors reached base before Horvat struck out.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN reliever Andy Davidson didn't allow a run in 51/3 innings
of one-hit work, but the Trojans (20-16), ranked 25th by Collegiate
Baseball, had already done their damage with a seven-run first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up a lot of runs,'' Lehr said. ``I think that really
helped us. We jumped on what they gave us. We had some mistakes
that hurt us, so the early runs helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Davidson led off the game with a triple and capped the
scoring with a single in his second at-bat of the inning to drive
in Lehr. Errors by shortstop Jason Watkins and center fielder
Phillips didn't help DeBiase (7-3), who allowed eight of the 10
batters he faced to reach base. The senior right-hander gave up
five earned runs on five hits in two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some tough breaks,'' DeBiase said. ``I got some
balls up; they're a great-hitting ball club. They're national
champs. I just wasn't on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehr was on at the plate and on the mound before tiring in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He went primarily with his fastball to retire the side in order
twice, strike out six and give up four hits in six-plus innings.
Lehr also went 3 for 3, including two doubles, with a walk and two
RBI.

REAL ESTATE: GETTING LAWNS IN SHAPE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While neighborly lawn-care advice is always plentiful
this time of year, plant experts say that not all advice is
necessarily good advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we say usually runs counter to what most people think
they should be doing with their lawns,'' said Dr. Frank Rossi,
assistant professor of turf grass science at Cornell University in
Ithaca, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While homeowners frequently believe they need to fertilize in
early spring to awaken lethargic lawns, Rossi said, his advice is
generally to hold off fertilizing until Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cornerstone of a lawn wellness program is deep, healthy
root growth,'' Rossi said. ``And when you aggressively fertilize in
early spring, you're promoting top growth at the expense of root
growth. That means that even though your lawn may be nice and
green, it may not be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting until the end of May to apply fertilizer, he said, gives
the roots time to develop and dig deeper into the soil. And that,
he said, not only produces healthier top growth, but it also allows
the roots to find and use water and nutrients more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 60 percent of all the top growth for the year happens
during the first six weeks of spring,'' Dr. Rossi said. ``And you
need as much support as you can get for that growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing homeowners commonly believe, erroneously, it
seems, is that once crabgrass is killed and gone, it's gone for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to really get rid of crabgrass is to use a
pre-emergent herbicide in the early spring,'' said Tim Elkner,
horticulture extension agent for the Penn State Cooperative
Extension in Lancaster, Pa. ``And then you need to repeat the
process for several seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a herbicide, he explained, kills the plants as they sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Elkner explained that repeated assaults on crabgrass are
necessary because once crabgrass gets a foothold on your lawn, it
sows the seeds of plants that may appear for several years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``When crabgrass produces seeds, it usually provides several
years' supply,'' he said. ``Seeds that don't sprout this year may
sprout next year or in years after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a pre-emergent herbicide for several seasons running is
necessary for eliminating crabgrass, he said. The trick to using
the herbicide is knowing when to use it.
</P>
<P>
   If you apply it too early, Elkner said, the herbicide will wash
away or become too diluted to do its job when the seeds finally
sprout. Apply it too late and the seeds may have already sprouted
and matured to the point where they are not affected by the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The usual advice is that it's time to treat for crabgrass when
the forsythia blooms,'' he said, adding that a more
scientific-sounding rule of thumb holds that when temperatures
remain above 50 degrees Fahrenheit for several days running, it's
time to apply the herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   Elkner also pointed out that homeowners who didn't get around to
seeding bare patches in the fall _ the best time to do it _
frequently apply seed in the spring. While seeding now is better
than not seeding at all or seeding in the middle of summer, he
said, homeowners should be careful not to seed and apply a
pre-emergent herbicide at the same time because the pre-emergent
doesn't differentiate sprouting good grass and sprouting bad grass.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi, the Cornell turf grass expert, said that if he had a lawn
with bare spots and crabgrass and had to choose between seeding or
applying a pre-emergent, he would seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and again our studies indicate that a dense, healthy lawn
is the best defense against crabgrass,'' he said. He explained that
since crabgrass needs plenty of sunlight to mature and produce
seeds, the thicker, higher and more healthy the lawn, the less
likely it is that crabgrass sprouts will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawn problem homeowners frequently encounter in early
spring is damage caused by grubs _ the larvae of the common garden
beetle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grubs are the No. 1 insect pest in lawns,'' said Hap Baer, a
senior consumer service specialist for the Scotts Company, a plant
and garden product manufacturing concern in Marysville, Ohio. ``And
upstate New York always has lots of grubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Baer said that unlike crabgrass, which infiltrates bare patches
where grass once grew, grubs kill the grass itself by eating the
roots.
</P>
<P>
   As with crabgrass, eliminating grubs is strictly a matter of
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to kill grubs when they are adolescents,'' Baer said,
adding that grub-control products, such as Scotts Grubex, should be
applied between April 1 and Aug. 15. ``Applying it much later than
that doesn't do much good,'' he said. ``And no matter when you
decide to treat for grubs, make sure to water it in deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   While grub populations have increased because of the recent
series of relatively mild winters, said Rossi of Cornell, treatment
now is not likely to kill grubs that are currently feeding, but
will probably be effective only on those that hatch during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If grubs are feeding on your lawn now, they're probably too
big to control chemically,'' he said, explaining that grubs that
are eating grass roots now have just made their way up to the
surface and are preparing to become full-fledged beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi said that one indication of a grub problem is the presence
of skunks or moles rummaging around in your grass. But the best way
to find out if you have grubs is to pull up some chunks of grass
and look for white, crescent-shaped insects with six legs dining on
the roots. ``An average lawn can tolerate seven to 10 grubs per
square foot,'' he said. ``If you have more than that, you have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   One point on which all experts agree, it seems, is that
homeowners are well advised to follow directions whenever applying
any lawn and garden chemical _ particularly pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't double recipes,'' said Baer of Scotts. ``Manufacturers
spend a lot of time figuring out the right amount of a product to
use. More is not better. If more was better, don't you think we'd
be the first to tell you?''

VIDEO SAID TO DEPICT MASS KILLINGS BY SERBS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

   A Kosovar refugee who said he recently escaped a massacre in his
village gave the BBC what he said was a videotape of the aftermath
of the incident that shows the bodies of nearly 100 men who he said
were killed by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The footage, which the man gave to a BBC correspondent in
Albania on Saturday, may be the first images documenting the
atrocities that many of those fleeing Kosovo have described to
reporters and foreign aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to establish independently the authenticity of
the amateur videotape, which was recorded by a man from the town of
Krusa e-Madhe, a small village in the southwest of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Melaim Bellamica, told a story that has become a
familiar one among the hundreds of thousands of refugees that have
been pouring out of Kosovo since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He said that on March 25, the day after NATO's first bombs were
dropped, Serbian forces began shelling the area. Later that day,
soldiers entered the town and began separating the men from women
and children, who were told to leave the village. He said that some
of the men, fearing the worst, tried to escape and were killed on
the spot. The others, he said, were shot one by one. None of them
were armed, he said, nor were they fighters with the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The footage which was broadcast on BBC and ABC News on Saturday,
showed the bodies of men, dressed in civilian clothing, sprawled in
fields surrounding the town. The video indicated that some of the
men had been shot in the back of the head or under the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN Saturday night, an elderly man from the same village was
interviewed as he crossed the Albanian border on the back of a
tractor. His description of the attack by Serbian forces was
similar to that of Bellamica. ``They put the men up against a wall
and shot them,'' said the man, who was allowed to leave because of
his age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamica said he survived the massacre by hiding for a week. He
filmed the bodies on April 1, after Serbian forces had left the
area, and arrived in Albania on Saturday. He gave the tape to
George Alagiah, a correspondent for the BBC, along with a list of
the names of those who were killed. ``I've done this so that my son
and my grandson will never forget what the Serbs did to the
Albanian people,'' he said.
