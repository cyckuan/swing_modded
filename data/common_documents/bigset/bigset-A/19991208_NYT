 SEATTLE: veteran officers.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And most recently, Stamper's department was weathering a scandal
over its failure to unearth details about a case in which a veteran
homicide detective was suspected of stealing $10,000 from a crime
scene and his sergeant was accused of covering up the crime. (A
first trial of the detective ended in a hung jury.)
</P>
<P>
   Stamper alluded to some of his roller-coaster history in his
letter to Mayor Schell, saying: ``Although my personal beliefs and
political views have often been at odds with many of my colleagues,
I've managed to love almost every moment of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stamper's action Tuesday was clearly linked to the
handling of last week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   While merchants and many protesters were furious, so were police
officers. Some have already talked of suing the city, and Tuesday
morning the police union president, Mike Edwards, said that many
officers were equipped with deficient equipment and forced to spend
as much as 20 hours straight on the police lines without food or
other support.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Smith, a 10-year veteran of the force, complained last
week to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that the department was
completely unprepared, despite advance warning that the town would
be flooded with protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they closed their eyes and said, `I hope
nothing happens,''' he told the newspaper, which also reported news
of Stamper's impending resignation in this morning's edition, hours
before the mayor made it official.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper said he had intended to resign sometime next year
anyway, after he had seen the force through both the WTO
demonstrations and any disruptions that might occur in the city
because of the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief, who once wrote an undergraduate thesis at San
Diego State University titled ``The Community as DMZ: Breaking Down
the Police Paramilitary Bureaucracy,'' said he decided to make it
clear now that he was intending to leave, probably sometime around
the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's natural for people to say, `Well of course the
police chief is going to say this or say that, do this or do that
because he wants to keep his job,''' he said Tuesday at the news
conference. ``What I've said is, I'm not abandoning my job, I'm
retiring from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell, by contrast, said that he had no intention of his
leaving his job, and believed that he could be a part of bringing
the city back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole community's hurting, I'm hurting,'' said the mayor.
``And I think that it's time to understand what happened, what can
we learn from it as a community. And before we start assigning
guilt the first step is, let's get the facts. All of us, together.
And then make our conclusions.''

TOP PRIORITY: A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The personal requirements of hard-core business travelers
haven't changed all that much since Chaucer wrote ``The Canterbury
Tales'' in the 14th century. Speed and safety may dominate, but
getting a decent night's sleep still ranks way up on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who you are, you are going to be grumpy and out
of sorts if you've got sleep deprivation,'' said Dale Moss, the
director of worldwide sales for British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with Moss last month in Miami Beach, where he gave the
keynote address at the annual PhoCusWright Internet travel
conference, where 800 delegates spent two days in a glitzy
high-technology environment thick with frenetic dot-com urgency. It
was a relief to find a quiet spot to discuss something as down to
earth as sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is currently topical in business travel because many
airlines, scrambling to grab a bigger share of the lucrative
first-class and business-class market on international routes, are
outfitting the premium sections of their planes with new seats that
fold down flat, like beds. Late next year, Virgin Atlantic will up
the ante by introducing business-class seats that fold down into
four-foot-wide double beds. (Stand by, incidentally, for the smirky
advertising campaign.)
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so radical is planned at British Airways, which was the
first to introduce the so-called flying bed in its first-class
cabins three years ago. Next month, though, the carrier will be
trumpeting new fold-down (single) bed-seats in business class on
its New York-London routes, with expansion to other routes set for
later in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Selling premium seats as companies struggle to cut soaring
travel costs is a tricky strategy. Fewer companies than ever will
now spring for first- or business-class travel, though they work
all the angles to get free frequent-flier upgrades. So airlines are
lunging at the remaining full-fare premium-seat market with
promotions that stress the value of premium service and comfort _
including a good night's sleep _ over that awful cattle-car ride in
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, people used to fly to London on a Saturday
night so they could start their business on a Monday,'' Moss said,
laying out one rationale intended to move the stone hearts in those
corporate travel departments. ``People don't do that anymore. They
go Sunday night and they start their business on Monday. They go
right from the airplane to work. You've got to get some sleep to be
able to do that and be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to sell the expensive seats is compelling,
especially on North Atlantic routes, which have been plagued with
excess capacity after carriers added planes that had been yanked
earlier this year from struggling Southeast Asia routes. So
airlines have been sharply discounting back-of-the-plane seats for
leisure travelers, which is not very profitable. On the other hand,
while first-class and business-class tickets make up about 14
percent of passengers on international flights, they account for 32
percent of revenue, according to the International Air Transport
Association.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, its profits battered in recent years by fierce
competition from Air France, Continental Airlines and other
aggressive carriers, is getting some results going after that
elusive market. Its premium traffic rose 6.5 percent in November
over the year-earlier month, though the company has said that it
expects to report a loss for the current fiscal year, the first
deficit since the airline was privatized in 1987. Moss said the
idea was to polish the brand name and stress service in the premium
business-travel market, where price is not always the sole
determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I want to gouge customers with higher prices,'' he
said. ``I want to give them better value, and I want to make some
money on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, of course, is himself a hard-core business traveler. He
has logged 300,000 to 400,000 miles a year for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Does he always fly first class or business class? ``When it is
available,'' he said. ``But if there's a customer with cash in hand
buying that last seat up front, just watch how fast I move to the
back of the plane, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Chances of having a bag lost, delayed, pilfered or damaged on a
domestic flight continue to rise. In the first nine months of this
year, the rate of ``mishandled'' bags was 5.24 per 1,000
passengers, according to the Transportation Department. That is up
slightly from the period a year earlier.

CRITICS SAY BUSH'S `SMIRK' DOES HIM POOR LIP SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ That people-winning smile of Gov. George W. Bush's may
have turned overnight into one of his biggest enemies, now known as
The Smirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far better a fun-loving grin than a grim-faced grimace,'' Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Tuesday. ``During his five years as
governor, I don't think anyone made an issue out of his smile. It
just goes to show the difference in presidential politics.''
</P>
<P>
   After two nationally televised debate appearances, suddenly the
pursed-lipped smile that crosses Bush's face in times of mirth and
stress has become fodder for talk radio and a symbol of the larger
question of whether Bush is a man of substance or an overgrown
fraternity boy.
</P>
<P>
   National commentators began commenting on Bush's smile last
month after he grinned repeatedly while delivering a speech on
international policy. The pace picked up last week after the Wall
Street Journal reported on the smirk after his first debate
appearance in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But the tidal wave that shifted media questions from the temper
of Sen. John McCain of Arizona to the smile of George W. Bush was
set off Monday during a Republican presidential debate in Phoenix
when Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah made a joke about Bush lacking
experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I really believe that you need more experience before
you become president of the United States. That's why I'm thinking
of you as a vice-presidential candidate,'' Hatch said, while Bush
watched him, smirking.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was defensive on Tuesday when asked whether he worried that
voters would be turned off by his smirk during his televised
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your interpretation,'' Bush said, not smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have got to make up their minds. I try not to take
myself too seriously sometimes, but I know what I believe. I know
the principles by which I make decisions. And I feel comfortable
that I can lead our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not feel like he had been ``sandbagged'' by
Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a pretty funny exchange. And should I be
fortunate enough to win my party's nomination and go on to win the
presidency, I won't hold all those years of experience in
Washington against him,'' Bush said. ``I'll let him carry my tax
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he believes voters eventually will gather enough
information on his experience as Texas governor and on his policy
positions to trust him as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make their judgments about candidates from a variety of
sources,'' Bush said. ``A lot of it has to do with the crowds in
Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. They'll take impressions off
the debates. When it's all said and done, they'll make up their
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question is what role the smirk will make in that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Houston talk show host Dan Patrick on KPRC radio said Tuesday
that Bush's smirk makes it look like he thinks he is smarter than
the person who is talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally syndicated columnist Tony Snow, a former speech
writer for Bush's father, former President Bush, last month said
Bush acts more like he is pursuing a hobby than a calling to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key indicator is the smirk,'' Snow wrote. ``It gives
bystanders the sense they're not dealing with an heir to Abraham
Lincoln, Ronald Reagan or George Bush, but an exhibitionist frat
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan said
voter perceptions of things such as Bush's pursed lips can make a
difference when it comes time to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body language is very important in presidential politics. It
can be decisive in some cases,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said there is a real difference between how Bush
projects in person and during televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing he is best at is connecting in these one-on-one
settings or on the stump,'' Buchanan said. ``Then on television, he
doesn't get to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan noted that Republican rival Steve Forbes has a frozen
smile and unblinking eyes that give him the appearance of being
``goofy,'' while Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, is viewed as wooden from his public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said former President Nixon was seen as ``scowling and
shifty-eyed,'' while former President Ford was known as ``stumbling
and bumbling.'' Former President Carter, he said, blinked too much
and smiled at inappropriate times. ``It gave people the creeps,''
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, said a smile such
as Bush's is open to the interpretation of the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's reaction to a nonverbal cue can be likened to a
Rorschach test,'' Jamieson said. ``If I don't like it, I will
interpret it as arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said she watched Bush's reaction to Hatch repeatedly
and decided the governor's expressions were ``very ambiguous.'' She
said it either could be someone laughing at Hatch's joke or someone
smirking to hide anger.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said Bush's smile is very much like his father's, but
his father was older, had a breadth of experience and no one
questioned his qualifications to be president. But Gov. Bush is on
a national stage for the first time trying to convince voters that
he has presidential qualifications, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of `Is there an empty suit?' has taken the form
of this metaphor,'' Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she does not see the alleged smirk. All she sees is
Bush's sense of humor, which is sometimes self-deprecating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has a wonderful sense of humor,'' Hughes said.
``That's a quality people appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bush flubbed a reporter's pop quiz recently to name the
heads of state in four international hot spots, he added a line to
his stump speech that his wife, Laura, had warned him not to try to
show off by naming all the world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, after a 1994 dove hunt in which he mistakenly shot a
low-flying Kildeer, Bush added a line to his speech that the cows
of Texas were thankful that it had not been deer season.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Republican political operative Charles Black said the
debate over Bush's smile or McCain's temper pales in a political
arena in which Gore and his challenger, Bill Bradley, are calling
each other liars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we (Republicans) are reduced to facial expressions vs.
degrees of temper, we're OK because those won't be issues by next
November,'' Black said.

UCONN BEATS ARIZONA, 78-69; MICHIGAN STATE BEATS KANSAS, 66-54 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sixth-ranked Connecticut showed the experience of a
defending national champion Tuesday night, holding off a
second-half rally by Arizona and defeating the second-ranked
Wildcats, 78-69, in the Great Eight tournament at the United
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The early-season tournament featured an elite field, drawing six
of the top 10 teams in the country: In the first game Tuesday
night, Michigan State, No. 4, outhustled previously unbeaten Kansas
(No. 5), 66-54. On Wednesday night, Cincinnati (No. 1) plays North
Carolina (No. 7), after Temple meets Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and Arizona swapped leads for 10 minutes to start
the game, before UConn used a barrage of 3-point field goals to
build a seven-point lead at halftime. The lead remained comfortable
until 10 minutes remained in the game, when Arizona began to close.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:26 to play, Arizona pulled within one point, 62-61.
Albert Mouring responded with five points, pushing the lead to
67-61 with 2:14 to play. Another basket, a steal, and a quick layup
by Edmund Saunders put the Huskies up by 10, 71-61, with 1:16 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Lute Olson said the loss might do his team good
because players will listen to a coach more once they had lost a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious who the experienced team was,'' Olson
said. ``There were so many times we'd force a shot, especially
after the other guys did something right. A young player says, `I'm
going to get that back.'''
</P>
<P>
   The game matched two strong-bodied point guards, Khalid El-Amin,
the irrepressible junior who led Connecticut to the national
championship last March, and Jason Gardner, a freshman at Arizona
who was the high school player of the year in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner is expected to fill the slot of Jason Terry, an
all-American player on last year's Wildcat team, which lost in the
first round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was quicker than El-Amin, with moments of flashy passing
and darting moves through the lane. But El-Amin had the shooting
touch, moving easily off of screens for midrange jump shots. He
scored 23 to lead all scorers, mostly on four 3-pointers. Gardner
managed 9 points and 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other starting freshman, guard Gilbert Arenas,
finished with 18 points to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   Another test came under the basket. Connecticut coach Jim
Calhoun hopes that Ajou Deng, a 6-11 sophomore who practiced with
the team last year, can replace Richard Hamilton, the most
consistent scorer last season, who is now in the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Olson holds similar hopes for Loren Woods, a 7-1 center and
Arizona's oldest starter, who transferred from Wake Forest as a
junior. Arizona needs him to dominate in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Woods had the better game, scoring 16 with nine
rebounds. Deng hit two long shots from the point in the first half,
and finished with 7 points and no rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's forwards, Saunders and Kevin Freeman, clamped down
on Arizona, holding Michael Wright and Richard Jefferson to a
combined 22 points, below their season average of 29. Freeman added
10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Robertson had 15 points for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   The first game of the night was won with experience. The older,
swifter Spartans outhustled the taller Jayhawks and outrebounded
them, 47 to 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more aggressive,'' said Roy Williams, the Kansas
coach, ``and I don't mind saying it, they outhustled us. They had
more savvy to get the position, and when we had the position they
muscled us out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans, who started all seniors and juniors, began the
game with poise, while the Jayhawks, with a freshman and sophomore
in the starting lineup, appeared rattled. They shot only 32 percent
from the field in the first half. In the second half, however,
their shooting improved to 50 percent, and a pressing Kansas
defense caused enough turnovers to shorten a 20-point lead to only
six with five minutes to play. Still, Michigan State seemed to grab
every rebound, pushing the lead back out to double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans went to the Final Four last season, and defeated
North Carolina in Chapel Hill on Wednesday. Against Kansas, the
Spartans shot poorly but rebounded relentlessly, finding enough
open shots to stretch out a 20-point lead on Kansas. Michigan State
is now 7-1, with its only loss to Kansas; Kansas is 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, the Spartans did not appear to miss Mateen
Cleaves, their senior leader and perhaps the best point guard in
the nation. Out another month with a broken foot, he led cheers
from the bench on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement at point guard, Charlie Bell, a junior, scored
21 points, including 13 in the first half as the Spartans built a
halftime lead of 39-23. He opened the second half with two more
baskets, stretching to a 20-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Mateen would have stepped up and handled the ball
and carried us on his shoulders,'' Bell said. ``We didn't break
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State shoved and intimidated Eric Chenowith, the 7-1
center from Kansas; he was 2 of 6 from the field. Kenny Gregory led
Kansas with 14 points.

PANEL RECOMMENDS FDA APPROVAL OF DEVICE FOR DIABETICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in Cygnus Inc. soared Tuesday after an
advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended
approval of the company's GlucoWatch device, which helps diabetics
monitor the level of glucose in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   GlucoWatch is noninvasive and is meant as an alternative for the
finger-prick test that many diabetics perform several times daily.
It uses a low electrical current to draw fluid through the skin to
the wristwatch-sized device, where it is tested for sugar content
three times an hour. It is worn like a wristwatch. A previously
approved device produced by Minimed Inc. uses a sensor inserted
beneath the skin, typically in the abdomen, that draws fluid
through a thin wire to a small computer that monitors results every
five minutes for up to three days.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Cygnus rose $8.8125, or 95.9 percent, to $18, in
Nasdaq trading. Shares in Minimed fell $5, to $61.
</P>
<P>
   ``The product has lots of imperfections _ that almost goes
without saying _ but this is a very needy and troubled patient
population,'' said Kurt Kruger, an analyst with Banc of America
Securities. Although studies have repeatedly shown that frequent
glucose monitoring and tight control of sugar levels are critical
to reducing the side affects of diabetes, few patients are willing
to prick their fingers so often. ``The worst part of being a
diabetic is not insulin delivery, it's the finger tests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The limitations of the GlucoWatch are that it requires a
three-hour warm-up period and calibration from a finger-stick blood
measurement. The device is capable of providing up to three
noninvasive glucose measurements an hour for 12 hours, so patients
must still prick their fingers twice every 24 hours. Cygnus said
the device was meant to supplement rather than replace the
finger-stick tests.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended approval with three conditions. The first
is an education program, which Cygnus said it had already been
discussing with the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The second involves changes in the product's labeling. And
third, the committee suggested post-approval study of detection of
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GlucoWatch monitor is a powerful and unique tool that has
the potential to provide glucose information that has previously
been unavailable,'' John Hodgman, the chairman and chief executive
of Cygnus, said in a statement.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The last three minutes of the second and
third periods were crucial stretches Tuesday night for the New
Jersey Devils as Jaromir Jagr and his Pittsburgh Penguin teammates,
who eliminated the Devils in the first round of the playoffs last
season, attacked relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the playoffs, and in many games this season, New
Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur was on top of his game as the Devils
scored a 2-1 triumph over Pittsburgh before a Continental Arena
crowd of 13,117.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur made 24 saves and allowed a power-play goal to Jan
Hrdina with 2 minutes 46 seconds left in the game, when the
Penguins had six attackers against three Devils for 28 seconds
after Pittsburgh had pulled its goaltender for an extra attacker at
a time it already had a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's brilliance helped the Devils (14-9-3) revive at home
after Saturday's loss to Calgary ended their unbeaten home streak
at 12 games, the longest such streak in the league this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all played well, and I'm happy we beat them,'' Brodeur
said. ``They came pretty strong there for a while late in the last
two periods, but we all played well. We want to play like that all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Brodeur, the Devils have rarely played this season
the way they did Tuesday night There were few flaws in their game
against the Penguins, and Brodeur and the penalty killers in
particular, led by Scott Stevens, were magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of pressure on them and tried to force the
puck,'' Stevens said of the penalty-killing units, which thwarted
the Penguins and Jagr six times in seven attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big, big, big saves all night,'' was the way coach Robbie
Ftorek described the play of Brodeur, who allowed under two goals
for the first time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden justified Ftorek's decision to play him for the
first time in five games by scoring the game's first goal, early in
the second period. Randy Mckay sealed the victory with his ninth
goal of the season midway through the last period by redirecting
Scott Niedermayer's shot from the left side. The goal came on the
power play, only the second power-play goal in the last 22 attempts
by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins played without Tom Barrasso, their No. 1
goaltender, who served his first game of a four-game league
suspension for slashing and breaking the arm of Toronto's Yanic
Perrault in an overtime loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso's place was taken by Jean-Sebastian Aubin, who was
promoted earlier in the day from the Penguins' top affiliate in the
minor leagues, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in the American
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Aubin had just one victory in seven games in the minor leagues,
but he played with the confidence of a premier goaltender by making
39 saves. Aubin had little chance on Madden's goal, 2:55 into the
middle period, as Madden was allowed a second chance from close
range on the right. He also had little chance on McKay's
redirection from directly in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 39 things I liked about this game,'' Penguins coach
Kevin Constantine said. ``Both goalies were good, but I think Aubin
was better.''

SITES SET FOR HEISMAN TROPHY HOPEFULS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's lower Manhattan. Tuxedos and cummerbunds are everywhere.
ESPN cameras are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes this announcement: This year's winner of the best
site for a Heisman Trophy contender ...
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's not going to happen. Web sites are probably going
to be the last thing brought up at Saturday's ceremony at the
Downtown Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are, here are the candidates:
</P>
<P>
   Cool Brees (www.drewbrees.net), a fan site dedicated to Purdue
quarterback Drew Brees.
</P>
<P>
   HerdQB.com, the official site for Marshall quarterback Chad
Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   The Ron Dayne Fan Club (www.rondayne.com), a fan site in
adoration of the record-setting Wisconsin running back.
</P>
<P>
   The Dynamic Michael Vick Website! (www.21cent.net/vick), a fan
site in tribute to the Virigina Tech freshman quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton has a one-page promotion
on the school's official site
(www.ramblinwreck.com/fbo/fbc/hamilton).
</P>
<P>
   And the winner ... Cool Brees.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsed by the Purdue quarterback at his own school page on the
Purdue server (cdweb.cc.purdue.edu/~brees), Cool Brees features a
critique of each game that Brees has played the past season.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Russ Lambert of Humble, Cool Brees also includes a
bulletin board, a Heisman watch, weekly statistics and
fan-submitted images of Brees' career with the Boilermakers and in
high school at Austin Westlake.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert was prompted to start the site last year when Brees led
the Boilermakers past Kansas State in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute the game ended, I ran to my computer to see if I
could find more information about Drew Brees online,'' Lambert
said. ``To my amazement, I couldn't find any sites about him.''
</P>
<P>
   A close runner-up is HerdQB.com. The site is designed by the
Marshall University's Education Technology department and
coordinated by the sports information office. It is highlighted by
a multimedia section where Pennington's fans can hear audio
highlights of his record-setting plays.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall used the same approach in promoting Randy Moss for the
Heisman in 1997. ``Our two attempts at promoting athletes for the
Heisman using the Web have been successful,'' said Brian Gunning,
assistant sports information director for Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The first runner-up is the Ron Dayne Fan Club Page, which poses
this question: Who is your pick for the Heisman? The site's five
selections start with Ron Dayne, the record-setting Wisconsin
running back.
</P>
<P>
   Fans unsure of the answer can get suggestions from the Ron Dayne
newsletter or the Ron Dayne chat room. The site, which includes a
message board and links to online articles, is not as complete as
the school's official campaign site (www.wisc.edu/ath/greatdayne).
</P>
<P>
   Matt Campbell of Chicago created the Ron Dayne Fan Club Page
three years ago. Since he registered the domain name as
RonDayne.com, the site has attracted more than 25,000 daily hits,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dayne fans as far away as South Korea and Russia have e-mailed
and posted their support for Ron,'' Campbell said. ``Many of Ron's
family and friends have also posted their support, and I have even
gotten e-mail from old girlfriends thinking that Ron is actually
running the site and collecting the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   NO PROFITTING: So what's the rule for fan sites for
student-athletes? NCAA spokesman Wally Renfro said the only
stipulation with student-athlete sites or fan sites about
student-athletes is that they not advertise or not link to
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that says a student-athlete can't have one,
but there is a problem if they advertise or hyperlink to
advertising,'' Renfro said. ``A fan can have a site on a certain
athlete; he just cannot profit from that site using the
student-athlete's name as an allure to the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro said the NCAA has not run into a problem with this yet.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky men's basketball star Jamaal Magloire recently pulled
the plug on his 2-month-old personal site (www.magloire.com). While
Magloire's site did not have ads, it did have links to commercial
sites.
</P>
<P>
   NOTEWORTHY: MSNBCSports.com plans comprehensive coverage of the
Heisman presentation. Readers can vote for their choice and access
news and features on the top candidates. Also planned are on-demand
audio interviews with all finalists ... The NFL's official Super
Bowl site (www.superbowl.com), produced by the NFL and ESPN
Internet Group, was launched Monday with a video archive, player
video diaries and Web cams positioned around host city Atlanta ...
A $1 million prize is available at the FANSonly Network
(www.fansonly.com) for the contestant who correctly predicts the
winner of all 23 college football bowl games and the exact score of
the Nokia Sugar Bowl.

BOND MONEY MAY SAVE BELMONT LEARNING CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Unified School District's top two
administrators have mounted a campaign to influence key state
officials to release bond money that could pave the way for the
completion of the Belmont Learning Center, the Daily News learned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the strategy includes restoring credibility to the
nation's second largest school district by recruiting the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to oversee school construction, a move announced
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But close connections between the Belmont scandal and U.S. Army
Secretary Louis Caldera, the federal official in charge of the
Corps, muddle the unusual arrangement between Los Angeles Unified
and the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera formerly worked for O'Melveny &AMP; Meyers, the law firm
being sued by the school district over its role in Belmont.
Further, he strongly supported building what has become the
nation's costliest school when he represented downtown Los Angeles
in the state legislature from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With a final decision on the fate of Belmont nearing, LAUSD
Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller and incoming Superintendent
Ramon C. Cortines met privately with Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the discussions said Miller and Cortines urged
the speaker to back off his stance against giving the district
state funds to complete Belmont atop an oil field seeping
potentially deadly and explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broached the subject of loosening up some state funds for
Belmont and the speaker said that would be a possibility. But he
wanted to see their plan for accountability,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Miller and Cortines shared their plan to turn over
the district's billion-dollar construction program to the Army and
held up the agreement as a key move by LAUSD's new regime to bring
accountability to the district.
</P>
<P>
   Cortines referred all inquiries toMiller, who said neither he
nor Cortines lobbied Villaraigosa to loosen the state's purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to find out whether capital money from the
state would be available,'' Miller said. ``We need to know that and
evaluate that in order to make a final recommendation to the school
board.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most school construction projects, the vast majority of
the $170 million sunk into Belmont has come from LAUSD's general
fund, not state bond money.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators have refused to release any additional money for
Belmont, citing potential safety risks at the property and the
project's exorbitant costs.
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa's recent vow to stop the state from giving Belmont
even a ``dime'' remains a major factor in several school board
members' opposition to finishing the partially completed campus. It
will cost an estimated $112 million to finish Belmont and install a
safety system under the campus.
</P>
<P>
   While Cortines favors completing Belmont, Miller said he remains
undecided. The availability of state funding will be the biggest
factor in his final recommendation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with Villaraigosa, Miller called a press
conference to roll out the district's agreement with the Army,
where he repeatedly insisted the federal agency was not being
tapped to rescue Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Miller said he would not close the door on using the
Army's expertise at Belmont if the board decides to complete the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he was unaware of Caldera's connections to Belmont
until being contacted by the Daily News. He said he was not
concerned about the matter since the secretary did not play a role
in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   While in the state Assembly, Caldera championed Belmont to the
school board on at least on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge you to continue in your efforts to build the Belmont .
. . without delay,'' Caldera told the board in October 1996. He
went on to compliment the legal tactics used by O'Melveny &AMP; Meyers
and defend the absence of competitive bidding in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance records show Caldera received numerous
donations in 1996 from LAUSD consultants working on Belmont and
from a partner in the consortium chosen by the district to build
the campus.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Caldera said the secretary was traveling across
the Midwest and could not be reached immediately.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for O'Melveny &AMP; Meyers denied the firm had any
involvement in Miller's decision to bring in the Army. Ralph J.
Shapira, a partner at the firm, said the district's deal with the
Army was not connected to his firm's lobbying efforts to save
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics of Belmont, most notably state Sen. Tom Hayden,
D-Los Angeles, remained unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that they were going to build Belmont,'' Hayden
said. ``No large project has ever gone undone in Los Angeles. No
matter how fiscally irresponsible and how much danger to the public
health that it creates.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be simplistic to reduce it to lobbying. O'Melveny has
its prestige at stake . . . It has put the firm's name on Belmont.
In the higher circles of influence in L.A. that rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, O'Melveny &AMP; Meyers hired Cerrell &AMP; Associates, a
well-connected lobbying outfit, to defend completing Belmont. The
law firm has acknowledged that the move is its final effort to save
the $282 million project, which in turn would reduce the amount of
damages the district could claim in a malpractice lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   While the school board has been forbidden by the district's
lawyers to meet with O'Melveny &AMP; Meyers, Miller agreed to sit
through a short presentation by the law firm last month.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he cut the meeting short and met the firm with the
board's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the school has indicated that they are leaning
toward scrapping Belmont in favor of building another high school
nearby. The board, however, has delayed its vote until Miller and
Cortines can offer their recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to give a presentation to the board on
Tuesday. The board also will review a budget for the Corps to
oversee the construction of 150 new primary centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the board voted to stop all construction at Belmont
and padlock the site. Eight days ago, it fired the school's
developer, Temple Beaudry Partners, a consortium led by Kajima
Urban Development.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
OK, so scratch Tom Osborne. Could Darrell Royal be Chet Gladchuk's
mystery candidate to take the football reins at the University of
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   How about Eddie Robinson? Bo Schembechler? Bud Grant? Bum
Phillips? Sid Gillman?
</P>
<P>
   Offhand, they're the only other living-legend types currently in
coaching retirement who come readily to mind. If Osborne, one of
the truly towering figures of college football, ever seriously
considered the equally towering challenge of starting fresh in
Houston at his friend Gladchuk's behest, anyone could be on the
athletic director's list. Anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders maintain that Gladchuk already has his man and is
only waiting for Friday to announce him to the world, after the
10-day job-posting period mandated by the state has expired.
Apparently, Osborne wasn't him, his presence on campus _ with his
wife in tow _ last week in a ``consulting'' capacity
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Just passing through on the way to the Big 12 Championship Game,
Osborne explained. He has known Gladchuk for a number of years, and
an ex-Cornhuskers athletic department employee, Chris Bahl, is one
of UH's associate ADs. Tom was kind enough to drop by to give his
two cents' worth on what the Cougars are doing right and what
they're doing wrong. He has already filed a written report,
detailing his candid observations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, never let facts stand in the way of a good story.
Gladchuk had to vociferously deny a bogus radio bulletin out of
Nebraska on Tuesday that Osborne was taking the UH job for $1
million per year. While the reported salary alone seemed somewhere
between outlandish and absurd, given the Cougars' well-documented
financial straits, as long as they have alums such as John Moores
and John O'Quinn interested in the future of the school's athletic
program, money isn't necessarily an object.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, not all of us UH grads turned out to be waiters,
teachers, shoe salesmen and sports columnists. The clout exists to
hire almost anyone, if he's sold as the right anyone.
</P>
<P>
   These days, a million bucks isn't that big a deal. It's rumored
that Texas Tech AD Gerald Myers, upon hearing about Osborne's
``deal'' in Houston, got him on the phone and said, ``Hell, Tom, if
all it takes is a million, come on out to Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders are also in a search mode, having politely
requested, and received, Spike Dykes' retirement. Clemson's Rich
Rodriguez, one of the nation's ranking young ``A-list'' assistants,
was the front-runner and even visited Lubbock. However, he decided
to stay at Clemson and wait for Don Nehlen to ``retire,''
Spike-like, at Virginia next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk would prefer to avoid the embarrassment of being
rebuffed in similar fashion, with his prized catch out perusing
real estate one day and offering a ``no, thanks'' the next. He's
going to extreme lengths to keep his finalists private, for their
sake and UH's. All he's on the record as saying is he wants the
best available coach and that, yes, he's in a hurry because he
doesn't want to hamstring the Cougars' recruiting efforts with any
undue deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he bounced Kim Helton less than 24 hours after the
season ended, ironically, with a three-game winning streak. But
because there has been no concrete evidence of formal contact
between the AD and the predictable, realistic candidates, the
intrigue builds daily.
</P>
<P>
   Chet's up to something, it appears _ and we can only hope. This
hire figures to be the one that jump-starts or finishes off UH's
bid to reclaim some stature as a Division I-A football school that
matters. Gladchuk strongly suspects a playoff for football's
national championship is inevitable, and he wants the Cougars
properly positioned to claim Conference USA's spot in the bracket,
after which on the field anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   It's about more than coaching, too. Chet's choice, aside from
being X's-and-O's compliant, has to have the charisma to rekindle
the dying fire in the constituents' bellies. A Tom Osborne, on
stature alone, could do that. But could a Tony Samuel?
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, a bright, young ex-Osborne assistant being touted by his
old boss, went 6-5 at New Mexico State. If you can win in Las
Cruces, you can win anywhere. Still, you wonder if he could sell
tickets in Houston from the get-go, which is when tickets need to
get going in exchange for hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   And if he did become an overnight success at UH, would Samuel's
head not be quickly turned by a higher-profile, better-paying
position elsewhere? Wanderlust is endemic to the coaching
profession. That's the dilemma Gladchuk faces. The hotter his hire,
the shorter the hiree's UH tenure may be.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why you go with a guy who has absolutely nothing
left to prove, and no bills to pay. Hmm, wonder if Clyde Drexler
knows anything about football?

BARAK HALTS EXPANSION OF WEST BANK JEWISH SETTLEMENTS  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 4th graf qualifying Israeli position)  By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was about
to land in Israel on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Ehud Barak was
seeking to defuse growing tensions with the Palestinians by
pledging to halt further expansion of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak stopped short of baldly declaring a freeze on
construction, partly _ though unsuccessfully _ to avoid provoking
the right-wing members of his coalition. But in an unexpected
change of approach, he called a moratorium of several months on new
settlers' neighborhoods to avert confrontation in a delicate
period, as the parties seek to reach a framework final peace
agreement by February.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be nothing on the ground,'' Barak's spokesman, Gadi
Baltiansky, said in an interview, expressing the decision more
bluntly than the prime minister. ``No bulldozers will work on the
ground. There is no point in embarrassing or provoking the
Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baltiansky acknowledged that work already in progress,
which was approved by the previous administration, might continue.
``If there are four floors of a school built, I am not saying that
the fifth will not happen,'' he said. Israeli peace advocates say
that thousands of units are in the construction phase.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Albright's visit, a minor crisis brewed between
the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Palestinians walked away
from the negotiating table on Monday to protest what they saw as
Barak's expansionist settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government initially described the walkout as a
stunt to lure the Americans back into a salvage role in the two-way
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly before Albright arrived here, Barak apparently
decided that the Palestinian concern was deep seated and needed to
be addressed. ``We, in the course of the next three months, are in
a critical political struggle, and therefore wisdom is needed and
this government has that wisdom,'' he said in a brief news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and his aides were caught
by surprise and did not know quite how to react to the declaration
or even what it meant. They received no direct explanation from the
Israelis and followed the story on the local news, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not receive anything, so it is difficult to comment on
things I have no knowledge about,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlers' leaders, with whom Barak has tried to build a
cooperative relationship, immediately understood that he had drawn
a line and expressed their disappointment. ``It turns out that
Barak gives in to pressure and extortion and he has succumbed to
the pressure of Arafat and the Americans,'' said Benny Kashriel,
the moderate leader of the Yesha Council, the settlers' umbrella
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to meet Barak on Wednesday at his house
for breakfast, to meet Arafat in Ramallah later and then, perhaps,
to return to Barak for a second meeting. After spending the day in
Damascus on Tuesday, Albright emerged from a three-hour meeting at
a hilltop palace with President Hafez Assad proclaiming to be more
optimistic about the possibility that Israeli-Syrian negotiations
could be revived. She declined to spell out why, and a senior
administration official later said Albright needed to talk to Barak
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions about negotiations are very much like mushrooms,''
Albright said at a news conference in Damascus. ``They do much
better when they are not in the light.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue of Jewish settlements in the disputed territory of the
West Bank is always a sore point between the Israelis and the
Palestinians. But when the Palestinians stopped the negotiations on
Monday, they were irked by a particular development. The Israeli
Housing Ministry, controlled by the settlers' National Religious
Party, had just published tenders, the bid specifications, for 500
apartments in the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that, depending on whose count is used, Barak's
government had authorized the construction of 1,800 to 4,000 units
in the West Bank since taking office in July. Barak's office uses
the lower tally, and the Palestinians the higher count. All the
approvals were for expanding existing settlements. Barak has said
no new settlements will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of housing starts has been accelerated by Housing
Minister Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National Religious Party.
Barak has not stood in his way until now.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has contended that the publication of tenders for the
1,800 units completes a process of authorization that started under
the right-wing government of his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that Mr. Levy as the housing minister has been
doing exactly what he wants to do without asking anybody,'' said
Mossi Raz, a spokesman for Peace Now, an Israeli peace group.
``Barak doesn't want to confront him, because he thinks in two
months he will have an agreement, and then he needs Levy and the
settlers behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also repeatedly said the tenders were irrelevant, even
though they deeply upset the Palestinians. Because it takes four to
six months for construction to begin after a tender has been
published, nothing will proceed until after the February deadline
for a framework peace agreement, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Barak has insisted, Israeli authorizations will mean
nothing in land that is to be given to the Palestinians, and it
will be none of the Palestinians' business in settlements that will
become Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning, so apparent to Barak, has eluded the Palestinians
and sounded like a runaround to them, and some members of Barak's
own Labor/One Israel Party complained to him about the seeming
expansion policy on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Barak's senior negotiator, Oded Eran, publicly lent
credence to the Palestinians' frustration, saying that the
Palestinian negotiators had repeatedly been telling him that they
were ``losing credibility in the eyes of the Palestinian public''
because of continuing settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign of a change, the prime minister's office said
earlier Tuesday that no new housing starts would be authorized. The
Palestinians did not think that went far enough.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday evening, though, Baltiansky said in an interview that
no new construction would start, ``including on those tenders
already approved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's words were less precise. He said on Tuesday evening:
``I feel that at this stage, in these months, when we are in the
midst of negotiations with the Palestinians on the final status
agreements, there is no point, and to a certain extent it hinders
the policy of Israel, to begin housing starts that have no chance
of being finished in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to Arafat, Nabil Aburdeineh, responded late
Tuesday night: ``He refused to utter the word, `freeze.' So what
does this mean? Albright is coming. So they want to play games.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Jackson paid deference to the NBA scheduling
gods Tuesday morning, but the gods seemed to ignore his gesture.
</P>
<P>
   He canceled the Lakers' usual game-day shootaround, wisely
noting that a mere 19 hours separated today's tipoff in Sacramento
from last night's final buzzer against Washington at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the same move that preserved their strength also sapped
their rhythm, and it took an extraordinary late effort to put away
a lousy Wizards team 91-80 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The team that relies on rhythm had 24 left feet, and they kept
stepping on their dance partners' toes. Early shots hit more glass
than net, and it took three quarters before they finally found a
groove and recorded their seventh consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. We didn't come in and get our normal shootaround
this morning,'' guard Derek Fisher said. ``So you think about it,
guys have basically just been kind of laying around, chilling all
day. Especially in that first half it makes it tough to find a
rhythm. It was evident tonight that we didn't have any rhythm on
the offensive end, didn't really have that spark or energy flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, he knew it would be that way, but he still felt like we
had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing at 5 o'clock (tonight) is going to be tough. He had to
do something to at least give us a chance to catch our breath a
little bit. We're looking at 16 hours, and we'll be lacing up
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing for control of the Pacific Division. With the
Portland Trail Blazers (15-5) losing at home to the Miami Heat
(14-4), the Lakers (15-4) moved into first place by a half-game,
with the Kings (11-4) not far behind. The Lakers also improved to
the league's best mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's 10 in a row then I'll be pleased,'' Jackson said
of the winning streak. ``I think this team's capable of winning 10
in a row, and it'd be a good landmark for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal both sputtered early, Bryant
missing jump shots from all over the floor and O'Neal being denied
some of his usual post position by the Wizards' Ike Austin and
Jahidi White.
</P>
<P>
   It left O'Neal with just 10 points by halftime and Bryant 2 of 7
from the field as the Lakers managed just a one-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Both regained their form in time to save the win. O'Neal scored
20 points in the second half, playing 46 total minutes. He also
contributed 16 rebounds and seven blocked shots. Bryant scored 14
in the fourth quarter _ going 10 for 10 from the foul line _ to
finish with 21, despite 5-of-19 shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on my jump shot a great deal,'' Bryant said.
``Some of the shots were pretty good looks; I wasn't making them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson called it ``one of his most anxious first halves,'' and
Bryant didn't deny it. ``I'm anxious every game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one else proved to be much help. Glen Rice was 5 for 14 from
the field, finishing with 15 points. Rick Fox added 11, but only
one point in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The starting backcourt of Derek Fisher and Ron Harper combined
for just six points, while the Wizards got most of their offense
from starting guards Mitch Richmond (23 points) and Rod Strickland
(12 points).
</P>
<P>
   Bad teams have often given the Lakers the biggest fits in recent
years. But they put away the Orlando Magic on Sunday by pouring it
on early, then riding out the rout. It appeared the Phil Jackson
Lakers had shed the bad habit of playing down to their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a team has to develop a killer instinct for the
.500-or-less teams, the ones that are teams that are going to be
difficult on given nights, that have problems internally or have
injuries, but can rise up and be difficult on some nights,''
Jackson said. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR; morning, but the gods seemed to ignore

HARPER STILL A KEY FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-LAKERSNOTES-LADN-SLANG (For use by LANG partners) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  LOS ANGELES _ As coach Phil Jackson retools his rotation and
prepares to move Kobe Bryant back into the starting lineup, the one
thing that probably won't change is the Lakers' heavy reliance on
veteran Ron Harper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least, as long as his surgically repaired knee holds up.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year veteran's defensive skills and knowledge of
Jackson's offense, mastered during his run with the Chicago Bulls,
have made Harper an invaluable asset. So much so that Jackson had
played him 30-plus minutes eight times in the first 18 games,
despite the fact Harper had offseason surgery on his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   He's averaging 29.1 minutes a game and is on pace to play 2,387
minutes this season _ his highest total since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Bryant back in the rotation, Harper is averaging 31
minutes a night. But he said he's not concerned about early
burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. I can't say I'm in pain or my knee hurts or
anything,'' said Harper, who turns 36 next month. ``For the time
that I have played, I feel very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certain games in which I'm going to play a large load.
I think that there are times (Jackson) will ease up on me,'' he
said. ``I know Phil, so I just go out and just play basketball. I'm
sure he's going to do the right thing. He's been doing it for the
last four years, so I have faith in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wants Harper to play alongside the young Bryant as much
as possible ``to lead him out there and help him stabilize the
offense'' and said he's ``not concerned about'' Harper's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to get through a season,'' Jackson said. ``Last
year he played probably too many minutes (31.6 per game for the
Bulls) and had to have a little bit of an operation in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until that time, I kind of nurtured him through three
seasons of championship ball where he's playing 18 to 22 or so
playoff games plus the regular season. We were able to put Ron down
in the course of a year and put him on the (injured list) and
restructure his training so ... the injured knee doesn't end up
debilitating him, causing more problems. That's one of the reasons
why Chip Schaefer, our trainer from the Bulls, is here, kind of
monitoring that. So I'm not concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL PAINS: Jackson wasn't here last season, but is well aware
of the difficulty the Lakers had dealing with the athletic
Sacramento Kings, tonight's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team had some experiences last year that weren't pleasant
against them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our part, we're still learning the pace and tempo of games
against these types of teams, how to do it.''

IN WAKE OF LATEST MARS FAILURE, NASA CHIEF CALLS FOR SPACE 
 PROGRAM INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  As NASA abandoned hope of communicating with the Mars Polar
Lander Tuesday, the agency's chief called the failed mission a
``wake-up call'' for the nation's space program and promised to
investigate every aspect of it.
<P>
   NASA administrator Daniel S. Goldin said in an interview with
The Chronicle that he will name a blue-ribbon committee of
independent experts in the next few days to take ``a good hard
look'' at its ambitious Mars program.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldin said the failure will not change the agency's plans
to launch another mission to the Martian surface in less than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The last, best chance to make radio contact with the spacecraft
yielded only silence early Tuesday. A somber Richard Cook, the
spacecraft's operations manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, said the flight team had ``played its last ace.''
</P>
<P>
   The failure is the third time since 1993 that NASA has lost a
Mars spacecraft. The Mars Observer vanished just before it was to
enter the Red Planet's orbit in 1993, and just three months ago,
the Mars Climate Orbiter was destroyed because of a communication
glitch that mixed miles and kilometers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997 was a spectacular success,
landing the first small rover vehicle to analyze Martian rocks on
the planet's arid red surface.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had mapped out an ambitious plan for visiting Mars in the
next decade, with three more missions scheduled for launch in 2001,
2003 and 2005. But Goldin said that given the latest failure, he
``cannot commit to maintain the momentum'' of the Mars program.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused the space agency of trying to do too much
with too little money with its ``faster, better, cheaper'' approach
to spaceflight, in which smaller, less expensive probes are
launched more often than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The $165 million Mars Polar Lander, along with its two
microprobes, which were supposed to slam into the surface
separately, was on a mission to study Martian weather and search
for water, which could help scientists determine whether life ever
existed on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   But NASA hasn't heard from the spacecraft since it attempted to
land Friday. Over four days and six opportunities to make contact,
NASA methodically eliminated possibilities that would explain the
lander's silence, including a misspointed antenna or a computer
reset.
</P>
<P>
   Among other possibilities: It crashed, burned up in the
atmosphere or was doomed by landing in a bad spot on the Martian
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin suggested that the lander might well have reached its
Martian target only to fall into an unsuspected gully or onto a
boulder that the camera aboard Mars Global Surveyor, the lone
spacecraft now orbiting the planet, could not detect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may even have gotten too deep into some soft soil or a
crack in the frozen crust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Future landing missions, Goldin said, must have far more
detailed knowledge of their target's terrain, which might require
orbiting spacecraft carrying cameras capable of far higher
resolution or sending down a whole fleet of probes to gather
close-up knowledge of the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Another need, Goldin said, is for the rapid development of more
``intelligent landers'' capable of probing the ground as the
landers descend and then altering course quickly if unanticipated
obstacles appear.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said he would welcome a congressional hearing into the
failure. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Huntington Beach, chairman of the
House subcommittee on space and aeronautics, said in an interview
Tuesday that he will hold such a hearing in February.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrabacher, a strong supporter of the space agency, said that
``NASA's science goals are excellent, but maybe the agency should
take off the shackles of launch dates that are too aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate committee that oversees
NASA's costs and missions, said in a statement: ``This failure does
not mean we should stop space exploration, but it does force us to
examine how we spent the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society,
said Tuesday that at least two surveys conducted in the past few
days by professional polling organizations showed that ``Mars
exploration is supported and will continue'' despite the failure of
the lander mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that NASA will have to scale back the schedule of
its missions and make them less ambitious,'' Friedman said. ``But
the recent success of other space exploration missions, including
the Pathfinder, are a vindication of Dan Goldin's `faster, better,
cheaper' policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some congressional posturing'' as a result of
the most recent failure, ``but the public accepts the risks in
space exploration,'' said Friedman, whose organization includes
more than 100,000 space enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, mission controllers finally
gave up after six attempts to hear from the lander. ``We're
certainly disappointed, but we're extremely determined to recover
from this and go on,'' said project manager Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the lander's team made yet another effort to
listen for a signal by using Stanford University's huge
ultra-high-frequency antenna, a 46-meter radio dish that stands on
a high hill behind the Palo Alto campus and just above Interstate
280.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and his communications engineers sent commands to the
vanished lander to ``bend and stretch'' its main antenna in an
effort to reach a connection with the big Stanford dish.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are also considering a plan to command the orbiting
Mars Global Surveyor to fly over the landing site during the next
few weeks to take pictures that might at least detect the lander's
parachute. The resolution of the camera is too low to detect the
lander itself.

 ASSEMBLY DEMOCRAT TO SEEK CAMPBELL'S SEAT  &HT;     By MARK SIMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Spurred by a personal promise of support from
President Clinton, Democratic Assemblyman Mike Honda decided
Tuesday to plunge into the race for the South Bay congressional
seat being vacated by Republican Tom Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It throws open a race Democrats had feared they could lose by
default and means a national focus on the campaign for the seat,
seen as one of a handful that could determine which party controls
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats can gain the majority by winning five of the 10
Republican-held seats that are being left up for grabs by
incumbents running for higher office or retiring.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 election, 99 percent of incumbents were re-elected,
while 11 of the 16 open, competitive seats changed party hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic search for a high-profile, well-established
candidate in the 15th Congressional District was reaching a
feverish pace as Friday's deadline for candidacy was approaching,
particularly after a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
poll showed Honda ahead of all the other Democrats and the leading
Republican, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic insiders said the poll, taken in the past month,
shows Honda with 38 percent and Cunneen with 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With Campbell running for the U.S. Senate Republican nomination,
Democrats see his seat, which covers most of eastern Santa Clara
County, as ripe for the picking.
</P>
<P>
   Before Campbell was elected to the seat in a 1995 special
election, it was held for more than 20 years by Democrat Norm
Mineta.
</P>
<P>
   The district is 44.5 percent Democratic and 35.7 percent
Republican, numbers that political strategists say indicate a
district that could be won by either party.
</P>
<P>
   Local and national Democratic leaders have been scrambling to
find a prominent candidate who can take on Cunneen, a Campbell
protege with the backing of much of the local GOP machinery.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Democratic hopes would have to ride on the
shoulders of two relative unknowns _ former Sunnyvale City
Councilwoman Robin Parker, who has had trouble raising money and
winning endorsements, and venture capitalist William Peacock, who
has won prominent endorsements from San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales and
the local labor central committee and has loaned his campaign
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   That was not enough for local members of the Democratic
congressional delegation, such as Zoe Lofgren, who lobbied Honda
vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Saturday, Honda, a former Santa Clara County
supervisor in his second term in the Assembly, was telling anyone
who asked that he would not run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   What changed, he said in an interview Tuesday, was the
assurances he got from national Democrats that he would receive
significant financial and strategic help in the primary election.
</P>
<P>
   He said the details of that aid have yet to be nailed down. He
told Democratic leaders he would interpret a call from President
Clinton as a ``major indicator of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Honda Tuesday morning, promising to headline a
major fund-raising event in the district, Honda said. By the
afternoon, Honda had filed candidate papers with Santa Clara County
elections officials. Tuesday evening, he boarded a plane for Japan
and a previously planned legislative visit there.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's decision left the continuing candidacies of Parker and
Peacock up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Tony Spitaleri said Parker had filed her candidacy
forms last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, today, she is in the race for the long
haul,'' Spitaleri said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock campaign consultant John Shallman said Peacock is
``definitely in the race to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Peacock was running for the seat when no one thought it
was winnable and has paid his dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Honda's entry into the race is nothing more than
opportunism by a ladder-climbing politician who had to be dragged,
kicking and screaming, into the race at the last minute,'' Shallman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But one Democratic insider that while with Parker or Peacock,
the race could become competitive, ``Mike Honda just walks into it
and makes it a competitive race.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunneen campaign manager Kevin Spillane said the Democrats were
being unduly enthusiastic, and hinted that Honda was being more
than a little naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desperation move by the Democrats. They've seduced him
into running with a phone call from the president in the last three
days of filing. It's interesting that he bought the promises the
DCCC made to him,'' Spillane said.
</P>
<P>
   Spillane ran Campbell's 1995 special election campaign against
Democrat Jerry Estruth. ``They made a lot of promises to Jerry
Estruth and didn't deliver,'' Spillane said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the campaign will expose Honda as an ``old-line
liberal'' who is out of step with the politically moderate district
that is in the heart of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he someone the high tech executives are going to feel
comfortable with? I don't think so,'' Spillane said.
</P>
<P>
   But Honda said he is a good match for the district, much like
the moderate Mineta was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of the district will determine what they believe.
We agree on the issues. I don't think people see me as an
ideologue,'' Honda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very competitive race,'' said a
Democratic campaign strategist. ``This seat has a very affluent,
highly educated electorate that's very cognizant of the issues and
very unhappy with what's going on in Washington. Clearly, a message
that works there says it's time for a change in Washington.''

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when entertainment and politics are ever more closely
allied, the cast of the hit TV comedy show ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has
come out against a March ballot initiative that would prohibit
same-sex marriage.
</P>
<P>
   All four actors in the ensemble cast appear in a 30-second TV
spot in which they say California's so-called Knight Initiative
would ``legalize discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans
and their families.'' The spots will begin airing as early as next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Network stars frequently do public service announcements and
take political stands, but it is uncommon for an entire cast to
proselytize against a ballot measure, especially one as
controversial as Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unprecedented,'' said Mike Marshall, manager of the No
on Knight campaign. ``We can't think, in all of our collective
years in politics, of a top-rated TV show's cast coming out and
doing a message like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall describes it as a ``motivation piece'' aimed at young
viewers who might need an incentive to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Knight Initiative, named after its sponsor, state Sen.
William J. ``Pete'' Knight, would limit marriage to the union of a
man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Its proponents say it restates current law and prohibits
recognition of same-sex marriages performed elsewhere if they ever
become legal in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the initiative is part of a campaign that
threatens domestic partner benefits, hospital visitation and
inheritance rights and other rights of lesbians and gay men.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent Field Poll, 50 percent of voters said they
favored the measure, 41 percent were opposed and 9 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   As an openly gay man with influence in Hollywood, ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' producer and co-creator Max Mutchnick said he wanted to do
more to fight the initiative than write a check. He did that, too,
but he also approached his show's cast and asked if they would be
interested in doing a spot.
</P>
<P>
   The actors _ Eric McCormack (Will), Debra Messing (Grace), Megan
Mullally (Karen) and Sean Hayes (Jack) _ readily agreed, Mutchnick
said, because their politics are in sync with his. The network,
NBC, was not consulted, Mutchnick said. In the show, both the
characters of Will and Jack are gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi. We are the cast of `Will &AMP; Grace,' '' McCormack begins.
``On March 7, Californians will go to the polls to vote either for
or against basic civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Glazier, communications director for the initiative, says
the debate is not about civil rights, but about being ``for or
against marriage between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Glazier said the campaign against the measure is supported by
``Hollywood liberals and the gay elite.'' He would not say whether
his campaign is gathering any ammunition from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mutchnick said he finds Proposition 22 ``repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's mean-spirited and divisive and intrusive,'' he
said. Mutchnick said he is afraid that the measure would turn back
the clock for gays in such critical areas as hospital visits
between same-sex partners, who are not legal relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm hit viscerally by something, I have to respond,'' he
said. ``If I was in a situation where I was unable to see my lover,
I don't know what I would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutchnick said no one in the cast worried that the TV spot would
alienate viewers or sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine that people who support this initiative
wouldn't be big fans of the show,'' he said. ``The spot will appeal
to younger voters. I have their attention, and I feel we can remind
them about this by using these faces.''

 TRUMP SAYS HE TALKS TECH'S LANGUAGE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD TRUMP 727 _ Developer Donald Trump _ sitting in splendor
in the gold-trimmed cabin of his private jetliner _ said Tuesday
that of all the men who aspire to lead the nation, he's the ``most
qualified'' to address the needs of Silicon Valley because ``most
of the presidential candidates have never made 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm much more qualified to speak to (high-tech
leaders) than most of the presidential candidates,'' Trump said in
an interview with The Chronicle aboard his plane as it swung across
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Silicon Valley ``the most incredible place on Earth, in
terms of revolution,'' Trump said, ``I think I'm much more
qualified to speak to them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of his colorful exploratory California swing
to consider whether he'll seek the Reform Party presidential
nomination, the high-flying Trump talked about high tech,
speculated on whether he would release his tax statements, and said
that _ unlike other presidential candidates _ he is a ``quick
learner'' when it comes to tough stuff like foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling magnate said the odds are ``50-50'' he'll run for
leader of the free world and that he is edging closer to doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But while arguing that he is ``very, very seriously''
considering the quest, Trump studiously avoided serious issues in
favor of pithy quotes and a plenitude of chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Mobbed by media as he finished touring the Simon Wiesenthal
Center's Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, Trump said a trip to
the center would do Pat Buchanan _ his chief rival for the Reform
Party presidential nomination and a ``Hitler lover,'' according to
Trump _ a little good.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day at Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond hockey arena, Trump
strode on stage to fireworks before a cheering audience of 21,000
at motivational speaker Anthony Robbins ``Results 2000'' seminar.
He asked for political advice (``Who thinks I should run for
president?'') and offered some business tips (``When somebody
screws you, screw 'em back a lot harder. The Bible says `an eye for
an eye,' (but) give me a break.'').
</P>
<P>
   He minced no words about other 2000 presidential candidates such
as Democrat Bill Bradley (``so far left you can forget it ... the
ultimate hypocrite'') and Buchanan (`talk about right ... give me a
break.'')
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, Trump showed a plainspoken, uncanny knack for
showcasing No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tired of being bullsh_--ed by these moron politicians,''
he told a lunch crowd Tuesday, in his biggest applause line of the
trip. ``I watched the debates last night. Tell me, how smart are
these guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Trump hinted to reporters that he's more likely to run if Bush
and Vice President Al Gore end up as the nominees of their
respective parties. The developer said he may even go negative if
he puts as much as $100 million into a campaign. ``I can't rule
anything out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he really hit his stride aboard Trump 727, the black, red
and white jetliner with TRUMP emblazoned on the side in 6-foot gold
letters. Schmoozing a handful of political reporters invited for a
20-minute flight from Los Angeles to Long Beach, he roamed the
luxurious leather-lined plane, complete with mirror-polished cherry
wood tables, gold bathroom fixtures, 10-foot bar and paintings
carrying signatures such as ``Renoir.''
</P>
<P>
   As his willowly girlfriend Melania Knauss retired to the white
brocade bedroom, Trump said the 727 could serve as his presidential
campaign plane. ``I don't think you're going to do better,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump told The Chronicle he intends to spend plenty of time in
California in the next few months. He plans to be back in January
at the Nixon Library to hold a book-signing for his ``The America
We Deserve,'' which was published this month. (``A lot of people
think I'm pushing the book, but just remember, I had three No. 1
best-sellers,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   And Trump, noting he has ``lot of friends'' among the
millionaires of Silicon Valley, confirmed he'll visit in early 2000
to assess the amount of interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The developer/author and deal-maker said he understands Silicon
Valley's dealmakers, and he has monitored the rise of high-tech
wealth and the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a guy who has lost $9 billion in his lifetime _ and
brags that he's made it all back and more _ Trump had a warning for
the valley's IPO wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary situation. Some of the companies are great
companies. And then others are not at all great. It is very scary
when the not-so-great ones are worth billions of dollars overnight.
They're going nowhere. They have no earnings, no revenues. They
have only one thing going, and that's lawsuits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's dot-com madness _ it's been that way for a
long time,'' he said. ``I, personally, like feeling the asset. In
building, you know, everything is very tangible. With the dot.com,
it's nothing that you see so easily. Personally, I like being able
to touch and feel the brick and mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is ready for the personal scrutiny that will come
with a presidential run, Trump said without hesitation, ``I'm
totally ready. ... People know what they're getting. I've been
through it. I'm an open book. I've always been an open book.''
</P>
<P>
   But will he release his tax returns or medical records, as other
candidates have done? ``I'd consider releasing them,'' he said.
``But it's just something I haven't given any thought to.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't matter anyway, Trump said. ``I'm known as somebody
who's very competent, and very rich. That's a potent combination.
That's not so bad.''

2 SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA REPRESENTATIVES BACK GORE'S CHALLENGER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two veteran San Francisco Bay Area congressmen _
George Miller of Martinez and Pete Stark of Fremont _ endorsed
Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley Tuesday, citing his
commitment to protecting the environment and providing health care
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign heralded the endorsements as a major
development in a state that has long been considered a Gore
stronghold. The vice president has been endorsed by 20 of
California's 28 Democratic representatives, his campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Washington news conference arranged by the Bradley
campaign, Miller praised the former New Jersey senator for helping
preserve the ecosystem of San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento
Delta by shepherding a landmark agreement between environmentalists
and agribusinesses through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would never have happened without Sen. Bradley,'' said
Miller, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources
Committee. ``I have fought side by side with this man in
legislative combat. ... I respect his integrity, his grasp of
intensely complex concepts and his determination to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller commended Gore for his ``very good environmental
record,'' but added that when it comes to California water, ``the
administration has just continued to drag its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark, who chaired the health subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee for 10 years, cited Bradley's $65 billion-a-year
plan to expand health insurance as the basis of his endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Bradley is willing to propose a big solution to America's
biggest problem _ 44 million uninsured Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Both criticized Gore for his unrelenting attacks on Bradley's
health proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you see an attempt by Sen. Bradley to engage this nation
in a very serious discussion about millions of children who are
uninsured ... and the first thing you get from the vice president
is an attack,'' Miller said. ``I think that's very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane defended Gore's criticism as a
legitimate critique of a bad policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign isn't about shooting free throws. It's about
running for president,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed a more limited, and less expensive, health
care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, a strong advocate of expanding
health care, also threw his support behind Bradley, calling it
``unconscionable in the wealthiest nation in the world that we
alone, among industrialized nations, have not found a way to
provide health insurance to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The new support brought to nine the total members of the House
and Senate who have endorsed Bradley, as  &LR; compared to about 130 for
Gore. Gore's supporters include California Sens. Dianne Feinstein
and Barbara Boxer, Gov. Gray Davis, 11 state senators, and all but
two Democratic members of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If endorsements are a test of the strength and support a
candidate is receiving, then by this measure Al Gore is doing
extraordinarily well,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   At their news conference, Stark, Miller and McDermott had kind
words for Gore in their initial statements (Stark said Gore would
make a ``good president,'' and Miller called him a ``good and
decent'' man). But neither Miller nor Stark could contain their
frustration at Gore's centrist politics, his aggressive campaign
tactics and his association with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moving to the right like a scared rabbit,'' warned Stark,
saying that many Bay Area voters may find Bradley closer to their
political leanings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether relations with the White House would suffer as a
result of their endorsement, Stark said: ``It can't get much
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore holds a commanding lead in California. A Field Poll
conducted in October showed Gore with a lead of 45 percent to 17
percent among likely Democratic voters. The Gore campaign is
counting on the state to bolster their candidate's edge in case he
stumbles in eastern primaries like New Hampshire and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Bradley could easily surge in California once voters
start to pay attention to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we will come into focus,'' Miller said. ``The vice
president is ahead, but the energy is clearly with the Bradley
campaign.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Trash mouth'' is what it was called around
the house when I was a kid. ``We do not talk that way in polite
company,'' my mother would explain as she pointed me in the
direction of my room for yet another ``time out'' to reconsider the
wisdom of repeating unkind remarks or anything I might have seen
carved on Ronald Corbet's desk top.
</P>
<P>
   My father insisted rude talk was the result of a limited
vocabulary and that only ignorant people had to resort to it in
order to express themselves. Uncivil behavior he blamed on arrested
development and believed that with education, appropriate
socialization, AND the cessation of puberty, most of us would
outgrow the urge to talk trash in public.
</P>
<P>
   Years later I've found out what happens to those who don't. They
are destined
</P>
<P>
   to jobs on radio as ``shock jocks'' _ those bottom feeders in a
pond where rude
</P>
<P>
   behavior is labeled talent; where incitement to violence is
ludicrously referred to as humor, and where insulting people
because of their color, religion, and even handicaps, is considered
entertainment, and where, when called to account for their
malicious drivel, they cower behind the Constitution, invoking
their right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional right? I don't think so. Slanderous sleaze is NOT
what our founding fathers intended to protect when they came up
with the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has established that
freedom of speech does not include obscenity or language designed
to incite a riot, as recently happened on an afternoon talk show in
Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   This local shock jock was taking Rev. Jesse Jackson to task for
his role in the Decatur, Ill., controversy over the six boys who
had been expelled from a local high school for fighting. He
suggested that Mr. Jackson was intent on becoming a martyr like the
Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and offered to help out by calling a
Miami hotel with a name similar to the one where Dr. King had been
killed, and asking the reservations clerk for a room with a
balcony. Once arrangements had been made he commented, ``all we
need now is a shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   This is entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   And this was not the shock jock's first offense. During the 1996
Olympics he was called to task for wisecracking that he was afraid
Muhammad Ali (who suffers from Parkinson's disease) might drop the
Olympic torch on a ``greasy Middle Easterner'' and start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   This is humor?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. Humor doesn't hurt. Humor is not gender- or
race-oriented and it certainly doesn't include making fun of
people's differences.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can be rude _ that doesn't take wit or wisdom _ just
listen to schoolkids in the halls. And yet, according to what I
read, when one of these shock jocks finally pushes the envelope
beyond its limits and winds up unemployed, other sleaze stations
line up to offer him a better job AND more money.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make sense?
</P>
<P>
   But let's check out the flip side of the coin, folks. Isn't the
listening audience just as guilty of truly tasteless behavior as
the jock? All we have to do is tune it out. Radio stations, like
any other medium, are not into charity work _ trust me. When no one
listens, advertisers are unhappy, and it's a fact of life that if
the sponsors ain't happy _ ain't nobody happy.
</P>
<P>
   So, the next time sleaze seeps through your radio, you might
want to do what I did this morning at the gym when I'd finally had
my fill of lyrics dedicated to the ``Mu-thuh!'' word, and choruses
focused on copulation _ I took off my cross-trainer and threw it at
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you might not.

 &HT;    Pitcher perfect: Baseball stories score
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even for a triviaphile, John ``Blue
Moon'' Odom's version of how he got his nickname isn't an
especially exciting nugget. But it becomes oddly compelling when
it's presented in Odom's own neat handwriting, with ``Oakland A's
13'' written beneath his signature and a business card thrown in
from Blue Moon Painting Service that notes the proprietor is a
``Former Pitcher/Oakland A's.''
</P>
<P>
   He is calling attention to his past glory. Yet, in doing so, we
do not see another preening athletic ego but an ordinary man taking
deserved pride in the extraordinary moments of his past.
</P>
<P>
   That's often the effect in Seth Swirsky's second disarmingly
simple volume of baseball correspondence, ``Every Pitcher Tells A
Story.'' The book includes letters from Odom and about 100 other
ballplayers and baseball personages.
</P>
<P>
   As in his 1996 collection, ``Baseball Letters,'' Swirsky uses a
straightforward formula. He writes letters to baseball players _
asking, usually, about a single aspect of the player's career or
his role in some historical event. Then he reprints the responses,
playing them alongside some rare and attractive photos.
</P>
<P>
   The responses add a few pallets to the storehouse of baseball
lore, but the appeal of the book is the in-their-own-handwriting
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Old timers such as Mace Brown, who recounts Babe Ruth's final
home run, write in a kind of cursive no longer drilled into
elementary-schoolers. Modern players tend to print, often using all
capital letters.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Steve Carlton uses letterhead reminding you he is
a 329-game winner. Luis Tiant writes in block letters on a piece of
lined notebook paper. Jerry Reuss sends a postcard of himself in a
Dodgers uniform, pithily answering a question about what it's like
to get together with his old teammates: ``Same players . . .
different wives.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters come from a mix of legends and journeymen. If
there's a common thread to them, it's the sense _ sometimes
acknowledged, often not _ that playing professional baseball was an
experience of fleeting magic that can never be recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   Balor Moore, a forgettable hurler who bounced between several
teams in the 1970s, recounts on a sheet of lined legal paper what
it was like to give up Mike Schmidt's first home run in 1972. Moore
has been out of the big leagues nearly two decades, but he
discusses the characteristics of his fastball as if he were still
toeing the rubber every fifth day: ``Normally my fastball away will
tail off the plate but in this instance it started low &AMP; away and
ran back over the heart of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Yount, the older brother of Hall of Famer Robin Yount,
tells of his heartbreaking brush with the big leagues in 1971.
Called in to relieve for the Houston Astros, he stood on the mound
and threw a few warm-up pitches but pulled himself out because of
pain in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He never got another chance to pitch in a major-league game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever thought that would be my only opportunity to pitch
in the major leagues, I would have done so,'' Yount recalls in
upper- and lower-case letters. Later, he concludes, ``I now have a
great family and could not be much happier, except that void of not
accomplishing my boyhood dreams.''

   It's this wistfulness that pervades many of the letters. And it
isn't limited to those who had brief careers or missed
opportunities. Consider Bert Blyleven, who pitched 20 years, won
287 games, threw 60 shutouts, struck out more batters _ 3,701 _
than any hurler except Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton, and played on
two World Championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough.

   ``Dear Seth,'' Blyleven writes on Minnesota Twins stationery.
``I wish I could have pitched until I die.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Straits of Florida a political battleground
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On Dec. 31, it will have been 40 years since Fidel
Castro took power in Cuba. We have been involved in several wars
over that period: Vietnam, Panama, Iraq, Kosovo. Those wars come
and go, the issues never completely resolved but the combat ended
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the war with Fidel Castro, fought chiefly on a
narrow, watery battlefield known as the Straits of Florida. U.S.
presidents may bellow in the White House against Communist Cuba,
and Castro may carry on protracted verbal assaults on the U.S. from
Havana, but the real battle is in the Straits.
</P>
<P>
   It is through the Straits of Florida that the rafters keep
coming, many trying to escape the rigors of a Communist society,
many others coming simply because they think they can earn an extra
buck in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of Castroism, the rafters were acclaimed as
courageous people seeking asylum from the island. They were greeted
warmly by non-Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of the raft people began to change, however.
After the Mariel boatlift in 1980, in which thousands of Cuban
criminals were compelled by a perverse Castro to come across, the
image declined.
</P>
<P>
   It continued its spiral downward when U.S. authorities came to
the realization that many of the rafters weren't rafters at all, at
least not until they were just a couple of miles off the South
Florida coast _ having been smuggled there by mother boats that
collected money from the refugees for the transit.
</P>
<P>
   American policy toward Cuban rafters is unlike that of refugees
from anywhere else. If you can put your foot down on land _ and
that can be done about 5 feet out from shore _ you can stay here,
be claimed by relatives and pursue those things that all Americans
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   But if your feet don't touch the ground and the Coast Guard puts
its arms around you, then, by agreement with Castro, it's back to
Cuba. The huge anti-Castro element centered in Miami never has
liked that deal; it wants all Cubans, whether they touch land here
or are discovered six miles off the Cuban coast, to be admitted to
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile arrangement the U.S. has with Castro is threatened
by a 5-year-old boy whom the Coast Guard rescued from an inner tube
on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10 others drowned when their
boats capsized in the Straits. Since the youngster's arrival, the
anti-Castro legions in Miami have adopted him as a symbol. His
mother gave her life seeking a better one for her child, is the way
it is told _ and not unconvincingly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, soon beginning its fifth decade of not
knowing how to deal with Castro, has backed away from the current
situation and left it to the Florida courts to decide whether Elian
Gonzalez stays in the U.S. or is reunited in Cuba with his father
who, divorced from the mother, is demanding his return.
</P>
<P>
   Miami relatives have showered the boy with clothing, toys _ and
love. They also allowed the child to wear, for the cameras, a Cuban
American National Foundation T-shirt, the CANF being the most
vociferous and identifiable of anti-Castro organizations.
</P>
<P>
   That must have triggered Castro more than anything else. He
immediately demanded the boy's return within 72 hours or face a
rejection of renewal of his immigration deal with the U.S. Talks on
that are scheduled for this month.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that conventional law is on the side of the
father, but there's nothing conventional when it comes to dealing
with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   If Castro follows through on his threat about immigration, then,
bizarrely, the Cuban exile community will have won a battle,
compliments of the 5-year-old. With Cuban cooperation on
repatriation of refugees dissolved, then anyone floating in the
Straits will be able to come here without fear of being sent back _
or, at the worst, be shipped to U.S.-held Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, people _ many good and others cunning _ have been
locked in a seemingly hopeless tug of war with the Castro
government. The boycott, like Castro, has a long, gray beard.
</P>
<P>
   That Castro has lasted 40 years despite an invasion, commando
raids, bellicosity and economic sanctions would indicate to me that
he is winning the war of the Straits. The fate of a 5-year-old boy
found floating there on an inner tube is just another in a
seemingly infinite conflict.

 &HT;    A stunning total for death by inefficiency
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's taken a couple of days for it all
to sink in. After all, the numbers are downright maddening: 98,000
people died last year from medical mistakes. The wrong medicine.
The wrong operation. The right scribbling on the wrong chart. Maybe
it was more. Maybe it was less. Thing is, no one out there is too
interested in keeping track.
</P>
<P>
   In my darkest moments, which come and go at whim, I worry. I
worry about my kid's grades. I worry about money. I worry that
George W. Bush will be my next president. And I worry about dying.
What would I do if I felt a lump in my breast? What would I do if
the semi behind me on the freeway didn't stop? But it turns out
cancer and car crashes shouldn't be my biggest worries. I have a
better chance of dying from the mishandling of a routine medical
event than I do cancer or traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers from the Institute of Medicine, affiliated with
the National Academy of Sciences, took an independent look at the
medical profession and released their findings earlier this week.
They said the industry could reduce the number of deaths each year
by half if it just kept track of accident trends and common
mistakes. The majority of what the researchers found was not
deliberate misconduct but mistakes due to poor communication, bad
handwriting, tired medical workers or malfunctioning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a medical horror story. Mine is my gall bladder
surgery. In the hours after the operation, I was shuffled from
floor to floor, post-op attendant to post-op attendant, without so
much as a glance from anyone in charge. I'm an insulin-dependent
diabetic, which was duly noted on my chart. But no one checked my
blood sugar. No one gave me food. My surgeon never checked on me.
My pain medicine never came. For 10 hours, I lay in a hospital bed,
too nauseated to move, too nauseated to leave. ``These
drive-through surgeries are awful,'' a nurse told me during a rare
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   I was angry enough to write the surgeon and the nursing
supervisor and my doctor and the hospital CEO _ all of which makes
me feel a little sheepish right now. Maybe I simply should have
thanked them. I lived.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, getting good health care comes down to
being a good consumer. Want to be heard in the X-ray room? Speak
up. Want to make sure you got Xanex at the pharmacy counter? Check
it yourself. Want to know for sure those are your test results the
lab tech is reading? Look at the chart. We live at a time when
there's more medical help out there than ever before, which means
we have to be more in charge than ever. And anyone who argues with
that is just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mystery to me how anyone could survive all those years of
medical school _ I can't sit patiently for five minutes. I couldn't
be a nurse. I couldn't draw blood. I couldn't stitch together a
crying kid's lip. I admire these people.
</P>
<P>
   I need these people.
</P>
<P>
   But how long are we going to expect perfection as they struggle
to survive in a world of paperwork and angry patients? How can
these people carefully tend to our illnesses when they've been told
to first fret about insurance cards and co-pays?
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, these medical mistakes won't always happen along
the lines of privilege. Some day, probably some day soon, someone
important will fall victim to the wrong pill, the wrong code on the
heart monitor machine, the wrong notation on the chart. And then
all the very incensed people in power will bustle about and appoint
committees and pay for studies and affect big change. A few of them
might even mention the 98,000 we lost last year.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A fitting site for King's memorial
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortcuts across the fruited plain:
</P>
<P>
   _ It is not far, physically, to FBI headquarters from the
prominent site on the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., near the
memorials to Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt, that has been
selected for a memorial honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Some of the
other distances _ emotional, perceptual _ are a good bit greater.
</P>
<P>
   There is justice here, and poetic justice. After Lincoln and the
founders, King arguably did more than any other citizen to expand
and secure liberty for Americans. That's justice.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, King had not only to overcome an entrenched system
of forced segregation but to do so against the relentless animus of
FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, who by dint of his position
should have been King's ally against oppression, instead spied on,
slandered and harassed King, even trying to provoke him to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's campaign of venom contributed to the atmosphere in
which King was martyred.
</P>
<P>
   Now King becomes the only private citizen honored by an official
memorial in Washington. Hoover's work has not held up so well.
</P>
<P>
   Poetic justice.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's near unanimity in observers' declarations that in his
first quasi-debate with the other Republican presidential
aspirants, George W. Bush neither harmed nor distinguished himself.
His spinners have it that he won, but that is a boast founded
mainly on their relief he didn't blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Undecideds, however, are left to wonder, still undecided, about
the stature of a candidate unable to stand out in a field that
includes Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that the case for Bush continues to rest
disproportionately on his ability to avoid committing fatal damage
to himself, John McCain's trailing footsteps may start sounding
closer.
</P>
<P>
   _ It has come to this: Select condom machines in some of the
better gas stations offer, in addition to the traditional models,
the ``Slick Willie,'' in packaging sporting the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Clinton was worried that he'd leave no legacy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The deaths of those six firefighters in Worcester, Mass., were
sad, angering and frustrating in their needlessness.
</P>
<P>
   At stake was only a derelict warehouse, but two of the
firefighters worried that some of the homeless might be living
there and went in to search for them. The other four followed when
their comrades didn't come out.
</P>
<P>
   There were no homeless, a fact that detracts none from the
heroism but adds a sense of maddening futility to the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   We've made an informal but basic decision to live with endemic
homelessness rather than heal the mental illnesses and the drug and
alcohol addictions that are its largest cause.
</P>
<P>
   We are not heartless, just _ oh, resigned. We've reached a
fatalistic accommodation with the phenomenon to the point where we
don't even register most of its roiling social ripple effects.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ripple effects become an undertow.

 &HT;    Net, personal charities offer more giving options
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's a happy holiday thought: Americans are giving
more than ever to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army alone brought in $1.2 billion from private
sources in 1998, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. The
newspaper also reported the most recent annual increase in overall
giving _ 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some new wrinkles in philanthropy _ do-it-yourself charities and
Internet giving _ could fuel even more growth.
</P>
<P>
   The year's end always brings an increase in donations to
charity. In part, that's because more charities ask for money right
about now, and charitable gifts are deductible on income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For many givers, however, the major reason is that it feels
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of donors are motivated by the concept of
becoming better stewards and giving back to the institutions that
helped shape their values,'' said Todd Gillingham, an executive
with Lutheran Brotherhood, a Minneapolis-based financial services
company.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey last year, Gillingham noted, nearly half said they
gave the most to churches or synagogues. The United Way was in
second place; political and arts organizations were at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the study found that Southerners were more likely
than others to give to churches or synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Private charities are an intriguing way to give.
</P>
<P>
   You can set up your own charitable fund now, perhaps even naming
it after yourself. You can contribute and take the tax deductions
right now, even if you put off the decisions on when to give and
which agencies will get your support. Another benefit is that
somebody else will do the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to set up your own charity. One is to
establish a donor-advised fund through umbrella groups.
</P>
<P>
   The second option is to open a charitable account with a private
financial institution. The most prominent are the Vanguard's
Charitable Endowment Program (1-888-383-4483) and Fidelity
Investments' Charitable Gift Fund (1-800-682-4438).
</P>
<P>
   There are some limitations. The minimum to open a fund is $5,000
or more. Your contribution is irrevocable. You may have some
control over investment choices, but they will be limited.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become a major resource for charitable giving.
You can search for charities that match your interests, check into
their credentials and even make your contributions electronically.
</P>
<P>
   At www.guidestar.org, you will find a database of more than
600,000 charities, and you can look at financial statements from
many of them. Scores of organizations are set up to take donations
over the Internet. Take a look at www.giveonline.org to make a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is www.charitableway.com, which maintains a
roster of retailers that give part of their sales to designated
charities. If you pick the American Hiking Society, for example,
you will find that Office Max gives 4 percent of online purchases
to it. You have to do your shopping through the Web site, and the
purchase price is probably not tax-deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other factors to consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Taxes: Your donations must be made by Dec. 31 to get the
credit this year. The charity must be a recognized nonprofit
organization, which is one reason for checking guidestar before you
give.
</P>
<P>
   If you are giving stocks or mutual fund shares, make sure you
have owned them for more than one year. Otherwise, your charitable
deduction will be limited to what you originally paid for the
shares _ not their appreciated value.
</P>
<P>
   People always say they give from the heart and not for tax
reasons. But one recent survey showed that people who itemize their
deductions gave an average of $1,277, or 2.1 percent of household
income, during 1998. Those who didn't claim the tax benefit
averaged $367, or 1.1 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scams: The Internet has made it easy for con artists to hit on
consumers. The usual rules apply: Don't bite on emotional appeals,
high-pressure sales tactics or names that are almost the same as
well-known charities. Don't give out credit card numbers or other
personal information to unknown telephone solicitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your own family: Some adults pass the word to children and
close friends that they don't want any more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   A truly rewarding gift would be an acknowledgement of a donation
to a favorite charity.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Millennium Madness is out of hand, and
the practical man felt the heat last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we doing for New Year's?'' his wife asked.
</P>
<P>
   She was baiting the bear, for the practical man's New Year's Eve
hasn't changed in 15 years. He puts the kids to bed, waits for his
wife to fall asleep on the couch, turns off Times Square and
reaches for the next book in his stack. The ritual is honed to
perfection and in no need of amendment. His wife knows this, but
she pressed on with glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the millennium, you know. We should celebrate!''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the ensuing domestic dispute ain't nobody's dirty
business, but the practical man's daring effort to avoid a night
out did yield two points of public interest.
</P>
<P>
   First, the world isn't going to end. When the practical man was
in engineering school, he was unlucky enough to have a
superstitious lab partner. Whenever a calculation came out even _
2.000, say _ he would shout out ``Gee willikers! Look at this!''
The class would hush and stare, but to this dolt's utter
disappointment, nothing else happened. Numbers are abstract; their
relationship to the physical world is all in our heads. The Earth
isn't counting its laps around the sun, that palm tree in your back
yard doesn't know how old it is, and most important, the fields of
wheat in Kansas and the cattle herds in Texas don't care what year
it is. So relax.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no cause for celebration. Come Jan. 1, you will
still have to work for a living, still have to take out the trash,
still have to deal with your teenager. That stack of work you left
on your desk will be waiting on you when you get back, that car
payment will still be due. If you need an excuse to party, be the
practical man's guest, but don't blame him when you wake up
depressed and vaguely ashamed because you half expected things to
be different.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: Thank you for your comments on the use of
calculators in math class. As a math teacher, I've long argued that
they undermine our attempts to teach basic skills, but I've gotten
nowhere. Now I'm losing another battle over cursive handwriting. I
say it is important for a student to be able to write neatly and
legibly in cursive. But an administrator at our school says that
with computers, children don't need to learn cursive. Any ideas? _
Kathy
</P>
<P>
   Give it up, Kathy. You're wrong. Kids don't need to learn
cursive. They don't need to learn to draw pictures. They don't need
to learn to play an instrument, or write poetry, or dance, or make
jokes, or get up on stage. All that Shakespeare/Jim Carrey/Miles
Davis garbage that makes life worth living has no business in
school. Creative things that give us individual personalities and
self-respect run counter to the true purpose of public education,
which, as any school board pinhead will tell you, is to teach kids
how to get a ``good'' job as a faceless, number-crunching,
word-processing corporate drone.
</P>
<P>
   JUST KIDDING!! Cursive writing is no big thing in the practical
man's life. But it is one of the little things that's his alone. It
has also come in mighty handy for taking notes, signing his name
and writing fearsome Post-Its to his kids. Somehow, ``Listen up,
boy! I want those chores done before I get home!'' works better in
a deranged cursive than in tidy print.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss is obviously that most common of meatheads _ an
education major who failed to educate himself. Wise him up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I have a great job. I do work that I love
and everyone is nice to me and really cares about me. But I've
decided to quit and move thousands of miles away to marry my
boyfriend, a baseball-ticket salesman. Am I nuts? _ Lesley
</P>
<P>
   How sweet, and permit the practical man to predict the course of
your romance:
</P>
<P>
   A year of bliss: You primp. He preens.
</P>
<P>
   A year of pregnancy: You get fat. He pretends not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   A year of waning affection: You say, ``You used to love me.'' He
says, ``We used to have a sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime of desperation: You watch the kids grow up. He
watches TV.
</P>
<P>
   Trust the practical man: You don't need to travel to board this
treadmill to oblivion. You can get on anywhere, and any guy will
do. But a job you love where the people love you is the holy grail
of adulthood. Few ever find it, and no one finds it twice.
</P>
<P>
   So, yeah, you're way nuts.

 &HT;    This is no charity wedding
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When a ``to whom it may concern'' e-mail
came to the paper from a rapturously in love former Jupiter, Fla.,
resident now living in Washington, D.C., I became the designated
whom, and I was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   I was concerned to see in her letter that Gabriela Fernandez,
22, was afroth with happiness, a happiness so wholesome and sweet
and selfless that I feared she would burst into pure radiant energy
before burning down to a caramelized lump of beatitude.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela, you see, wanted the world to know that she was getting
married to Michael McCoy, 24, also of Washington, on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. The wedding went off swimmingly and the nupes are
on a boat somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, naturally, in anticipation of the wedding, she was in a
state of grace. But that wasn't what prompted her to write. It was
how she met her husband-to-be that compelled her to tell the world.
She met Michael at a Washington homeless shelter where both had
volunteered to work with children of parents receiving job
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``My purpose for writing is to let those who are seeking a
lifetime companion know that clubs and bars aren't the only place
to find a mate. You will find the kind of person you want to marry
volunteering their time to help the less fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela went on to explain that two years ago while finishing
up her last semester in public policy at Palm Beach Atlantic
College, she went through a bad patch after a failed relationship.
She did what she always does when feeling sorry for herself _ she
flung herself into helping others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the nation's capital to learn more about public
policy and while there, offered my services at a central D.C.
homeless shelter on Saturday mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   There she met Michael, an ecological engineer for the Maryland
Department of Environment, who came to the shelter to assist with
the children. ``Michael became my best friend and helper with these
inner-city children. From there, our relationship progressed and we
fell in love.''
</P>
<P>
   It struck me that there was more than good luck on my e-mailer's
side. She had odds. I mean, statistically, where are you more
likely to score with a good potential spouse resume, during last
call at the local meat rack, or unloading roof trusses at a Habitat
for Humanity work party?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always,'' she wrote, ``found my consolation in
volunteering.''
</P>
<P>
   Now just a darn minute. Always? Always is a lot. Define always,
I mentally challenged the feel-good bride-to-be of the year.
Admittedly, I was stewing in my own spiritual miserliness. Beyond
giving blood, I can probably count on one finger the times I've
volunteered for anything. I called Gabriela at work for the
National Criminal Justice Reference Service, where she works with
statistics, and thanked her for her thoughtful letter.
</P>
<P>
   And then I said, real casual-like, ``You mentioned in your
letter you always find your consolation in helping others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, ``My family instilled that in me as far back
as I can remember. They're from Venezuela and did a lot of charity
work while I was growing up. Since eighth-grade, they've encouraged
me to go to places with various church groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Could she remember one or two such projects?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one year we helped build an orphanage in Africa. This
was for children of victims of the AIDS virus. I learned to pour
concrete and roof a building. Another time a school group worked
with poor people in Colombia at a children's hospital. Once I led a
group to Mexico to build a church. I can make bricks from
scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she chose PBAC not just because of the easy commute from
Jupiter, but because of the college's strong tradition of community
service as a requirement for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I've had quite enough of this,'' I said to Gabriela.
``Where's the depravity?'' I said, stealing a line from
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't this good. I can pass on what you say about
helping others as your own way to get yourself out of the dumps,
but until you tell me some of your filthy little secrets, nobody is
going to sit still for a sermon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was afraid of this, that I would come off as some
kind of goody-goody, when I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not?'' I asked, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to go to another country and help people. It's an
adventure. I have no illusion that I've gotten more out of learning
about other cultures than I've given by my so-called good works. In
fact, the money spent traveling might have been better spent just
sent to these places. The truth is, it was a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't much of a confession,'' I sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, so you want to know the truth about me? All these things
I've talked about are easy. It was easy to love the children in the
homeless shelter when they run up and hug the first person to give
them some attention. It's easy to run off to another country for a
good cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the real world, the everyday world, the world that
counts that I don't measure up. How giving and gracious was I to
the guy who cut me off in traffic today?''
</P>
<P>
   How giving and gracious was she?
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him something all right. How patient was I with my
annoying co-worker who really needed to talk to someone last week?
Did I even make eye contact, much less smile at the homeless person
I pass on the street every day? And the clerk who took forever to
pack my groceries? Did I show my annoyance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Snappish, were you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there you have it, readers. Some of these people who fling
themselves at one cause or another are actually having a pretty
good time. Could it be that the real dirty little secret of
volunteerism is that there is a bit of Mother Teresa in all of us,
and that when we find it, we are not sacrificing but indulging?
</P>
<P>
   There's your depravity. Not that there's anything wrong with
that.
</P>

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 1209: Welcome to Elliottville. A family kind of
town
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in
small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters _
at the end of the millennium. Photos and a sig/locator map are
available. Names and Pflugerville are CQ'd)
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLIOTTVILLE, Texas _ It's a faded green wooden sign at the
intersection of two dirt roads: ``Welcome to Elliottville, pop.
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliottville isn't a real town, one that's incorporated and on a
map and has people fighting all the time over annexation issues and
dog leash laws.
</P>
<P>
   No, Elliottville is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   It's home to the Elliotts, a family that lives in a way others
might think vanished a long time ago, a place where the pudding is
made from scratch and the dogs are all friendly and don't have to
wear leashes at all.
</P>
<P>
   The four households that make up the Elliott clan put the sign
up years ago as a way to let party guests know that they were in
the right spot. The marker _ three miles west of Elgin and a mile
and a half south of U.S. 290 _ has hung there so long that some
people in Elgin think the town is real. (The Elliotts think that's
hilarious.)
</P>
<P>
   They are, by their own admission, old-fashioned. They believe in
homemade food, and staying married, and living near extended
family. In an age of microwave dinners, scattered relations and
single parenthood, it's hard to imagine that anyone lives the way
the Elliotts do.
</P>
<P>
   But spend a little time with them and you wonder why more people
don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's like being on Walton's Mountain, but without the saccharine
fakeness of that '70s TV show. Everyone is polite; everyone,
literally, is family. People constantly say ``Make yourself at
home'' to strangers, and there's a communal dog, Sadie, who's
welcome at every doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down and a plastic cup of sweetened ice tea appears. Sip it,
and relax, because no one's in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   They are not country people who have lived on the land for
generations and are trying to preserve their lifestyle in some kind
of rural oasis. In fact, they all used to live, and most of them
still work, in Austin. But over the years they decided the urban
life was not for them, that being able to drive five minutes to
Eckerd Drugs for cough syrup or being able to order pizza at 11
p.m. didn't make up for the traffic, noise and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the stress of being in town, it's nice to be out
here with the cows,'' says Bruce Elliott, rounding up his herd as
the sun sets. The light in the field is magical, a soft orange that
makes a nearby pond glow. ``This is my favorite time of day. It's
nice to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour of town
</P>
<P>
   Out here, the Elliotts own 117 acres. The men raise 60 head of
Red Brangus cattle, in addition to their city jobs; the kids fish
for bass and catfish, and play in their treehouse or the nearby
fields, watching out for briar patches and snakes. At 6 p.m., you
can always find a sit-down meal at one of the houses. Anybody in
the family is welcome. How do you know how much to cook? a visitor
asks, and the answer is, you just know. It always works out fine.
</P>
<P>
   Stand at the intersection where the sign hangs, and you can see
the homes of the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   Up to the left is the home of Wayne Elliott, 65, and his wife
Mary Ellen, 60. They own and run Universal Auto Title Services in
Austin, which has two Austin offices. They commute in every day, a
25- to 30-minute drive. Step inside their home, and there's a
pleasant smell of cake and potpourri. Long, comfortable couches and
scattered chairs form a large conversation area, big enough to
accommodate the whole family. Lace and ribbon decorate a homemade
photo album cover and other knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road to the right is the home of Dorothy Tippie, 78,
Mary Ellen's mother. She lives alone (if living within a few steps
of your extended family can be considered alone). Dorothy raises
chickens, collecting their small brown eggs daily. The henhouse
continues inside, in a way _ she collects porcelain and ceramic
chickens, all sizes, and has more than 250 in a glass china cabinet
in her living room. A string of pink crocheted hearts hangs on the
front door, spelling out ``Welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy is often on her red Toro riding mower, tooling around.
She recently celebrated her birthday with a big party at the VFW
Hall in Elgin. At the party, she danced to the music of a live
country-western band, despite her problem knee, and looked
resplendent in a blue-and-gold outfit, with carefully applied
eyeshadow.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a few steps away from Dorothy, is the home of
Bruce Elliott, 43, his wife, Tammie, 40, and their daughter,
Jennifer, 17. Bruce is Wayne and Mary Ellen's son, and works with
his parents at their auto title companies; Tammie works in Elgin
for a tile company. If Elliottville were Monaco, Jennifer would be
the princess. She was Miss Western Days '98 in Elgin, and the whole
family came to see her in her tiara and gown. She's a senior at
Elgin High School (``Home of the Mighty Maroons'') and one of those
teenagers whose resume is so packed it probably doesn't all fit on
one page: student council president, varsity cheerleader, vice
president of drama club, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer is the only one who's ever been embarassed by the sign.
She hates when other teens ask, ``Are you one of the Elliotts from
Elliottville?'' Just talking about it, she blushes a little.
</P>
<P>
   Walk across the yard from Bruce and Tammie's place, and you're
at Sandy and Shane Harris' home. Sandy, 37, is Wayne and Mary
Ellen's daughter and Bruce's sister. She works with her parents and
brother at the title companies. Shane, Sandy's husband, is 38 and
an electrician with Kanetzky Electric Inc. in Austin. Their sons
Cade, 9, and Corey, 7, are both students at Copeland Elementary.
Shane's the comic in the family, and also the ``resident
exterminator'': One time he killed a snake that was swimming in
Mary Ellen's pool. When he cut its belly open, there were four baby
birds inside. In front of the Harris home, the boys' motorbikes are
parked; inside, there's a whole room devoted to Shane's hunting
trophies (but there's no trace of the snake).
</P>
<P>
   The birth of a farm
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen overnight, this move from the city to the
fields.
</P>
<P>
   When Bruce was a little boy, he had a horse named Sonny. The
family kept the horse in a stable; then the stable was sold and
they had to find a new place to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne and Mary Ellen decided to buy some land where they could
keep the horse, and ended up purchasing 50 acres, the core of the
property they now own. To help make the payments on the land, they
bought two small houses in Austin, moved them onto the property and
rented them out. They kept the horse in a stable, and set up a
little camping area for themselves, where they would come on the
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   After Bruce and Tammie were married in 1977, Bruce thought about
moving away from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lived to be in the country from the time I was able to
walk,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tammie rented one of the houses on the property from his
parents. A few years later, when Shane and Sandy got married, they
moved into the other house. At that point, Wayne and Mary Ellen
gave each of their children the houses they were living in. Since
then, there have been additions and plenty of remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   But their addresses haven't changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Wayne and Mary Ellen joined them on the land, in a
house they built up at the top of the hill. In 1995, Dorothy, tired
of being so far from the rest of the family, moved into her own
home, down the street from her grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   With the country move came a family-centered way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, Cade and Corey hardly know what it would be like not
to have their grandparents a short walk away. They've grown up with
Sunday dinners at Mary Ellen's house. The family favorites are
roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, salad and
banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still use real potatoes, not boxed ones,'' Mary Ellen says
proudly. The Elliotts like doing things ``the old-timey way,'' she
says. ``With fresh green beans and tomatoes, and fresh okra.''
</P>
<P>
   Till death do us part
</P>
<P>
   Another mainstay of Elliott life, along with home-cooked meals
and courtesy, is staying married.
</P>
<P>
   The couples in Elliottville have been married a total of 133
years, if you count Dorothy, who was married for 50 years before
she was widowed.
</P>
<P>
   Brief courtships and long marriages are a family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne met Mary Ellen just before her 16th birthday. She had just
started working at a burger joint where Wayne, 20, was the night
manager. His knees got weak every time she walked up to him. ``He's
crazy about you,'' the other girls told Mary Ellen. On their first
date, he offered her an engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   They were married three months later, on June 26, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Tammie met at a stock show. He had recently graduated
from Lanier High School; she was still going there. They had mutual
friends, and similar interests (including living on a farm and
raising hogs or cattle), and were married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   Shane asked Sandy to the 1979 Lanier High School senior prom,
held at the Driskill Hotel. She wore a sleeveless blue flowered
dress; he wore a blue tuxedo. She was a little nervous, because
that was their first date. They were married in 1982, after she
graduated from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't divorce in this family,'' Mary Ellen says.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the car locks
</P>
<P>
   If this were a visitor's guide to Elliottville, it would include
this tip: Learn the nicknames right away.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen is ``Meemy''; Wayne is ``Gossy''; Dorothy is
``Nanny''; Bruce is ``Unc.'' They were thus christened by the
children, and now everyone uses those names.
</P>
<P>
   Something else to know _ Sadie, the Australian shepherd, will go
up the hill to Wayne and Mary Ellen's house, but she won't come
back down unless someone gives her a ride in a car. (Someone always
does.)
</P>
<P>
   Gizmo, the Pekingese, knows how to ride on Corey's motorbike.
She sits in front of him and props her little paws on the
handlebars, the wind pushing her fur back as they zoom from house
to house, the dog yapping happily.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody locks their cars, except Dorothy, who still hasn't shed
all of her city ways. And if you're driving to work in the morning
and some of the cows have gotten out, it's your responsibility to
get them back behind the fence before you leave.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, there's always a project. It might be
rebuilding the barn fence, digging a new tank or working on the
chicken coop. The Elliotts used to raise exotic animals _ Boer
goats, hedgehogs, sugar gliders, potbellied pigs, emus. But there
wasn't much of a market for them, and now they just raise cattle,
and the chickens that Dorothy keeps.
</P>
<P>
   There's always an automobile to use if yours breaks down;
there's always someone to pick up your kids from school if you
can't. Early in October, for example, Shane and Sandy went to
Barbados for several days to celebrate their anniversary. While
they were snorkeling and enjoying the beach, Mary Ellen took care
of the kids, and Dorothy drove them to school.
</P>
<P>
   Getting along
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone could do this. Many people, if they had to live
within shouting distance of their parents or in-laws, would give up
in frustration after a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrie Engelman lives in Pflugerville and has been Sandy's best
friend since seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could live that close to my family,''
Engelman says, laughing. She admires the Elliotts' restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have a good relationship and respect their
boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   What do they do if there's a disagreement?
</P>
<P>
   If a couple fights, ``you keep it in your house,'' Shane says.
No making everyone else take sides or drawing the whole family into
an argument. ``You can't do that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Population change
</P>
<P>
   They might have to change the sign next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer will graduate this spring, and hopes to attend Texas
A&AMP;M in the fall, majoring in political science or theater. That
would bring the population to nine (not counting a friend who's
renting a small house on their property).
</P>
<P>
   But after that, the sign probably won't change until Cade or
Corey graduate-- , more than a decade from now. The rest of the
Elliotts, it seems, plan to stay here forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total tranquility here,'' Mary Ellen says. ``The
businesses are turmoil, and once you get away from there, and out
here, you can relax and you don't have to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, Bruce and Tammie moved back to Austin for
several months, while she was pregnant with Jennifer. They came

 &HT;    And God said, 'Let there be leather seats'
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When you're really sorry, I mean really, really
sorry, shouldn't you be able to say so in comfort?
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a company called Genuflex in Venice, Italy, you
can.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reuters news service, Genuflex markets a posh
$6,250 confessional booth that has air conditioning, heating, black
leather seats, soft lighting, a walnut finish and a hygienic filter
that separates the penitent from the priest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, those doing the confessing can regulate the
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this a little extravagant for a confessional? Heck, a
place like that in Austin would rent for about $950 a month. If
this kind of high-dollar religious equipment becomes trendy, the
next thing you know, the Baptists will be conducting baptisms in a
Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   If Genuflex had catered the Last Supper, they probably would
have served lobster tail.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of buying one of these things and turning it into a
game room. All you'd need to do is add a pool table, a dart board,
a TV set with DirecTV hookup, and the new inflatable cooler chair
from Budweiser that holds 12 cans under the cushion. Then you could
invite the guys over, and they could swap lies while they asked for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   I've never shot pool on my knees before, but there's a first
time for everything.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, this Genuflex confessional booth is fancy enough as
it is to be the Neiman Marcus his-and-hers gift. It certainly would
make for a unique Christmas present.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, when you stop to think about it, the fact that the
Italians are selling an air-conditioned confessional means just one
thing. The Italians don't have central air.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'll admit it. I don't go to church. I probably should. I
might meet a better class of people than I do at the liquor store
where I stop on the way home from work. Then again, I might run
into the same people in church that I see at the liquor store.
Whether I'd recognize them dressed in a suit is another matter. But
isn't this comfortable confessional booth at cross purposes?
Shouldn't a person who is confessing his sins suffer a little?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of air conditioning, shouldn't there be a hot plate for
the confessor to sit on with a control knob that jacks up the
temperature according to the severity of the sin?
</P>
<P>
   You'd put it on three for car theft, and jack it up to nine for
carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Austin, I doubt if you could find a high-dollar
confessional booth such as the one Genuflex sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain level that people ought to feel comfortable
to confess their sins, but we don't have any big overstuffed chairs
in there,'' said the Rev. Jeffrey Allison, pastor of St. Ignatius
Martyr Church at 126 W. Oltorf St. in South Austin. He added that
his church's confessionals ``are just kind of plain and boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Allison's church has the standard wooden phone
booth-looking confessionals built into the back wall of the church.
The doors of the confessionals are locked during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have people who would come in and sleep in here,''
Father Allison explained. Heck, with the Genuflex confessional,
this wouldn't be a problem. With the Genuflex booth, street people
could move in and take up housekeeping.

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 1209: Welcome to Elliottville. A family kind of
town
 &HT;    (Eds: This is another story in a series of reports on life in
small-town America _ the values, the stories and the characters _
at the end of the millennium. Photos and a sig/locator map are
available. Names and Pflugerville are CQ'd)
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLIOTTVILLE, Texas _ It's a faded green wooden sign at the
intersection of two dirt roads: ``Welcome to Elliottville, pop.
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliottville isn't a real town, one that's incorporated and on a
map and has people fighting all the time over annexation issues and
dog leash laws.
</P>
<P>
   No, Elliottville is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   It's home to the Elliotts, a family that lives in a way others
might think vanished a long time ago, a place where the pudding is
made from scratch and the dogs are all friendly and don't have to
wear leashes at all.
</P>
<P>
   The four households that make up the Elliott clan put the sign
up years ago as a way to let party guests know that they were in
the right spot. The marker _ three miles west of Elgin and a mile
and a half south of U.S. 290 _ has hung there so long that some
people in Elgin think the town is real. (The Elliotts think that's
hilarious.)
</P>
<P>
   They are, by their own admission, old-fashioned. They believe in
homemade food, and staying married, and living near extended
family. In an age of microwave dinners, scattered relations and
single parenthood, it's hard to imagine that anyone lives the way
the Elliotts do.
</P>
<P>
   But spend a little time with them and you wonder why more people
don't.
</P>
<P>
   It's like being on Walton's Mountain, but without the saccharine
fakeness of that '70s TV show. Everyone is polite; everyone,
literally, is family. People constantly say ``Make yourself at
home'' to strangers, and there's a communal dog, Sadie, who's
welcome at every doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down and a plastic cup of sweetened ice tea appears. Sip it,
and relax, because no one's in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   They are not country people who have lived on the land for
generations and are trying to preserve their lifestyle in some kind
of rural oasis. In fact, they all used to live, and most of them
still work, in Austin. But over the years they decided the urban
life was not for them, that being able to drive five minutes to
Eckerd Drugs for cough syrup or being able to order pizza at 11
p.m. didn't make up for the traffic, noise and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the stress of being in town, it's nice to be out
here with the cows,'' says Bruce Elliott, rounding up his herd as
the sun sets. The light in the field is magical, a soft orange that
makes a nearby pond glow. ``This is my favorite time of day. It's
nice to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   A tour of town
</P>
<P>
   Out here, the Elliotts own 117 acres. The men raise 60 head of
Red Brangus cattle, in addition to their city jobs; the kids fish
for bass and catfish, and play in their treehouse or the nearby
fields, watching out for briar patches and snakes. At 6 p.m., you
can always find a sit-down meal at one of the houses. Anybody in
the family is welcome. How do you know how much to cook? a visitor
asks, and the answer is, you just know. It always works out fine.
</P>
<P>
   Stand at the intersection where the sign hangs, and you can see
the homes of the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   Up to the left is the home of Wayne Elliott, 65, and his wife
Mary Ellen, 60. They own and run Universal Auto Title Services in
Austin, which has two Austin offices. They commute in every day, a
25- to 30-minute drive. Step inside their home, and there's a
pleasant smell of cake and potpourri. Long, comfortable couches and
scattered chairs form a large conversation area, big enough to
accommodate the whole family. Lace and ribbon decorate a homemade
photo album cover and other knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road to the right is the home of Dorothy Tippie, 78,
Mary Ellen's mother. She lives alone (if living within a few steps
of your extended family can be considered alone). Dorothy raises
chickens, collecting their small brown eggs daily. The henhouse
continues inside, in a way _ she collects porcelain and ceramic
chickens, all sizes, and has more than 250 in a glass china cabinet
in her living room. A string of pink crocheted hearts hangs on the
front door, spelling out ``Welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy is often on her red Toro riding mower, tooling around.
She recently celebrated her birthday with a big party at the VFW
Hall in Elgin. At the party, she danced to the music of a live
country-western band, despite her problem knee, and looked
resplendent in a blue-and-gold outfit, with carefully applied
eyeshadow.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a few steps away from Dorothy, is the home of
Bruce Elliott, 43, his wife, Tammie, 40, and their daughter,
Jennifer, 17. Bruce is Wayne and Mary Ellen's son, and works with
his parents at their auto title companies; Tammie works in Elgin
for a tile company. If Elliottville were Monaco, Jennifer would be
the princess. She was Miss Western Days '98 in Elgin, and the whole
family came to see her in her tiara and gown. She's a senior at
Elgin High School (``Home of the Mighty Maroons'') and one of those
teenagers whose resume is so packed it probably doesn't all fit on
one page: student council president, varsity cheerleader, vice
president of drama club, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer is the only one who's ever been embarassed by the sign.
She hates when other teens ask, ``Are you one of the Elliotts from
Elliottville?'' Just talking about it, she blushes a little.
</P>
<P>
   Walk across the yard from Bruce and Tammie's place, and you're
at Sandy and Shane Harris' home. Sandy, 37, is Wayne and Mary
Ellen's daughter and Bruce's sister. She works with her parents and
brother at the title companies. Shane, Sandy's husband, is 38 and
an electrician with Kanetzky Electric Inc. in Austin. Their sons
Cade, 9, and Corey, 7, are both students at Copeland Elementary.
Shane's the comic in the family, and also the ``resident
exterminator'': One time he killed a snake that was swimming in
Mary Ellen's pool. When he cut its belly open, there were four baby
birds inside. In front of the Harris home, the boys' motorbikes are
parked; inside, there's a whole room devoted to Shane's hunting
trophies (but there's no trace of the snake).
</P>
<P>
   The birth of a farm
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen overnight, this move from the city to the
fields.
</P>
<P>
   When Bruce was a little boy, he had a horse named Sonny. The
family kept the horse in a stable; then the stable was sold and
they had to find a new place to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne and Mary Ellen decided to buy some land where they could
keep the horse, and ended up purchasing 50 acres, the core of the
property they now own. To help make the payments on the land, they
bought two small houses in Austin, moved them onto the property and
rented them out. They kept the horse in a stable, and set up a
little camping area for themselves, where they would come on the
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   After Bruce and Tammie were married in 1977, Bruce thought about
moving away from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just lived to be in the country from the time I was able to
walk,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tammie rented one of the houses on the property from his
parents. A few years later, when Shane and Sandy got married, they
moved into the other house. At that point, Wayne and Mary Ellen
gave each of their children the houses they were living in. Since
then, there have been additions and plenty of remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   But their addresses haven't changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Wayne and Mary Ellen joined them on the land, in a
house they built up at the top of the hill. In 1995, Dorothy, tired
of being so far from the rest of the family, moved into her own
home, down the street from her grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   With the country move came a family-centered way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, Cade and Corey hardly know what it would be like not
to have their grandparents a short walk away. They've grown up with
Sunday dinners at Mary Ellen's house. The family favorites are
roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, salad and
banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still use real potatoes, not boxed ones,'' Mary Ellen says
proudly. The Elliotts like doing things ``the old-timey way,'' she
says. ``With fresh green beans and tomatoes, and fresh okra.''
</P>
<P>
   Till death do us part
</P>
<P>
   Another mainstay of Elliott life, along with home-cooked meals
and courtesy, is staying married.
</P>
<P>
   The couples in Elliottville have been married a total of 133
years, if you count Dorothy, who was married for 50 years before
she was widowed.
</P>
<P>
   Brief courtships and long marriages are a family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne met Mary Ellen just before her 16th birthday. She had just
started working at a burger joint where Wayne, 20, was the night
manager. His knees got weak every time she walked up to him. ``He's
crazy about you,'' the other girls told Mary Ellen. On their first
date, he offered her an engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   They were married three months later, on June 26, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce and Tammie met at a stock show. He had recently graduated
from Lanier High School; she was still going there. They had mutual
friends, and similar interests (including living on a farm and
raising hogs or cattle), and were married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   Shane asked Sandy to the 1979 Lanier High School senior prom,
held at the Driskill Hotel. She wore a sleeveless blue flowered
dress; he wore a blue tuxedo. She was a little nervous, because
that was their first date. They were married in 1982, after she
graduated from Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't divorce in this family,'' Mary Ellen says.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the car locks
</P>
<P>
   If this were a visitor's guide to Elliottville, it would include
this tip: Learn the nicknames right away.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen is ``Meemy''; Wayne is ``Gossy''; Dorothy is
``Nanny''; Bruce is ``Unc.'' They were thus christened by the
children, and now everyone uses those names.
</P>
<P>
   Something else to know _ Sadie, the Australian shepherd, will go
up the hill to Wayne and Mary Ellen's house, but she won't come
back down unless someone gives her a ride in a car. (Someone always
does.)
</P>
<P>
   Gizmo, the Pekingese, knows how to ride on Corey's motorbike.
She sits in front of him and props her little paws on the
handlebars, the wind pushing her fur back as they zoom from house
to house, the dog yapping happily.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody locks their cars, except Dorothy, who still hasn't shed
all of her city ways. And if you're driving to work in the morning
and some of the cows have gotten out, it's your responsibility to
get them back behind the fence before you leave.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, there's always a project. It might be
rebuilding the barn fence, digging a new tank or working on the
chicken coop. The Elliotts used to raise exotic animals _ Boer
goats, hedgehogs, sugar gliders, potbellied pigs, emus. But there
wasn't much of a market for them, and now they just raise cattle,
and the chickens that Dorothy keeps.
</P>
<P>
   There's always an automobile to use if yours breaks down;
there's always someone to pick up your kids from school if you
can't. Early in October, for example, Shane and Sandy went to
Barbados for several days to celebrate their anniversary. While
they were snorkeling and enjoying the beach, Mary Ellen took care
of the kids, and Dorothy drove them to school.
</P>
<P>
   Getting along
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone could do this. Many people, if they had to live
within shouting distance of their parents or in-laws, would give up
in frustration after a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrie Engelman lives in Pflugerville and has been Sandy's best
friend since seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could live that close to my family,''
Engelman says, laughing. She admires the Elliotts' restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have a good relationship and respect their
boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   What do they do if there's a disagreement?
</P>
<P>
   If a couple fights, ``you keep it in your house,'' Shane says.
No making everyone else take sides or drawing the whole family into
an argument. ``You can't do that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Population change
</P>
<P>
   They might have to change the sign next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer will graduate this spring, and hopes to attend Texas
A&AMP;M in the fall, majoring in political science or theater. That
would bring the population to nine (not counting a friend who's
renting a small house on their property).
</P>
<P>
   But after that, the sign probably won't change until Cade or
Corey graduate-- , more than a decade from now. The rest of the
Elliotts, it seems, plan to stay here forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total tranquility here,'' Mary Ellen says. ``The
businesses are turmoil, and once you get away from there, and out
here, you can relax and you don't have to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, Bruce and Tammie moved back to Austin for
several months, while she was pregnant with Jennifer. They came
back to the land on a fishing trip. Bruce noticed how quiet his
wife was, and then saw the tears running down her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been home in nearly a year,'' Tammie said.
</P>
<P>
   They moved back to the land not long after.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't guess we'll leave again,'' Bruce says. ``I knew it was
the only place I wanted to be.''

 &HT;    tandardized exams for U.S. students a way to improve schools
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush opposes a standardized
national test for public school students.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame. A standardized national test would go a long way
toward educating millions of this nation's students, parents,
teachers, administrators and schools boards.
</P>
<P>
   A national test also would be an education for the nation's
taxpayers and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   This education would not be in the three Rs but in knowing which
states and schools are doing a good job and which are not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush explains his opposition to a national test by saying that
education should be the job of states and local schools, not the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But that answer is a dodge. It sounds good to his supporters _
and would-be supporters _ who favor state's rights and condemn Big
Government.
</P>
<P>
   The answer also sounds good to Americans who know that the
federal government really does little to fund or influence the
nation's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 6 percent of the budgets of America's public schools
is supplied by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, presidents, and cabinet officers have
bragged about their roles in shaping the course of America's public
education. They exaggerate. In truth, they have done little.
</P>
<P>
   What little money the federal government gives to the nation's
public schools is weighed down with strings and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Local taxpayers fund the lion's share of their own public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The state kicks in extra money, especially in an attempt to
equalize educational opportunities for children who live in
unprosperous school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Then the feds put in their two-cents worth.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to establish a standardized national test for
public school students does not envision a federal take-over of
local public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That, indeed, would be a disaster. Imagine some bureaucracy like
the Postal Service or the Internal Revenue Service in charge of the
nation's public schools. It's a scary thought.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it's difficult to imagine how any federal
bureaucracy could have done any worse than America's educators,
teacher unions and self-indulgent Baby Boomers during the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
   After years of feel-good education designed to boost the
self-esteem of students and parents, America began to realize that
many of its children could not read their high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Due to social promotions and grade inflation, parents of honor
students were horrified to learn that their college-bound children
had to take no-credit remedial classes to learn what they should
have learned in high school or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a big fan of standardized state tests. He has seen how
they have been instrumental in boosting learning for Texas school
children.
</P>
<P>
   The grade-level Texas tests, which are curriculum based, have
begun to put accountability and responsibility back into public
education.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' standardized tests let students, parents, teachers,
administrators, school boards and taxpayers know how they are doing
compared to the standard as well as to other schools and school
districts around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas schools know exactly where they need to improve. The good
schools provide valuable models.
</P>
<P>
   A standardized national test for public school students could be
just as beneficial for states and the nation's public schools.
States and schools that do not meet the standard will know that
they need to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The states and schools that excelled on the standardized
national test would provide models for the others.
</P>
<P>
   A standardized national test must not come with strings. It must
not dictate curriculum. It should be a measurement of learning,
nothing more. But that would help.

 &HT;    Web sites keep it simple; attract teen shoppers onlineBy Frances
Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teens shopping online are the same as the kids you see in the
mall. They love to shop, but they hate being treated like kids.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites marketing directly to kids are struggling to hit the
right note with young consumers and their parents. They're also
developing ways for kids to shop online without asking mom or dad
for a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study of 16-22-year-olds from Forrester Research,
47 percent or 12.4 million young adults are online and have an
average of $3,000-$5,000 to spend annually. Teens are extremely
loyal to their favorite brands, but that doesn't translate into
online visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers have this notion that young adults are very
different and go after the cool stuff,'' says Forrester analyst
Ekaterina Walsh. ``So they stack their sites with unnecessary
features like chat, games and music that kids don't expect from a
retailing site.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to Pepsi and Levis as two sites that have loaded up
with lots of ``hip'' Web gimmicks to lure young shoppers, but
instead are turning them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levis has its own music channel and a petition you can sign to
protest violence in schools,'' Walsh says. ``The one thing they had
that was useful, which they pulled out, was online purchasing. You
can do all kinds of things on the Levi's site but you can't shop.
Kids don't want to see music or games on a retailing site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are making their own decision and they have been for a
long time, especially urban kids,'' says Ginger Thomson, president
of DoughNet, an online service for kids 13-18 who don't have the
credit cards typically needed for Web shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can open a bank account for their kids with
www.DoughNet.com's virtual banking partner, US Access Bank in
Louisville, Ky. Purchases made from online retailers or donations
to non-profit organizations are deducted from the account.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says young adults don't completely live up to their
rebellious images. They may not want to go shopping with mom and
dad, but they still want parental approval before they head out on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those sites has a parent section,'' Walsh says.
``They want parents as allies. The pitch is what is the alternative
to not using DoughNet? Letting kids run loose in the mall with your
credit card? That's probably their worst nightmare. Sites like
these let parents determine where the kids can shop and what they
can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps them away from pornography and extremely violent
books and videos. Another teen-oriented shopping site,
www.ICanBuy.com, has controls that allow parents to choose the
storestheir children can shop at and approve each purchase before
the youngster completes the order.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson says DoughNet members usethe site to shop and invest on
their own. It includes investment tools that help kids budget the
money in their account.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do want to be smarter about spending money, since they
don't have that much of it.'' (The average DoughNet member has $115
in his or her account.)
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says the best approach is not to treat teenagers like some
exotic species to be suckered into shopping, but to treat them like
adult shoppers. ``These kids are mature and pragmatic,'' she says.
``Especially the boys. They will pay extra to get something without
a hassle. They want quality for as little money as possible. They
are willing to hunt for brands and convenience. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The best model is Wal-Mart,'' Walsh says. ``It's on top of
teens' lists of brands they like and sites they visit. Yet Wal-Mart
is a clean site. You can just get in, shop and get out. All the
people trying to attract kids are doing exactly the wrong thing.
That's the irony. It's really just old wine in a new bottle.''

 &HT;    The wish list: Online shoppers hottest navigation tool for the
holidays
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wish lists and gift registries could be the hottest thing online
next to Pokemon trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll from Harris Interactive and www.amazon.com,
people shop online to avoid the crowds, the lines and the hassles
of shopping at the mall. They want to be able to shop quickly and
easily, anytime day or night, so they can spend more time with
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that did come through in the survey,'' says
Amazon.com's marketing vice president Jaleh Bisharat, ``is that
finding the right gift is the most stressful part of online
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   So Amazon and other online merchants have devised ``wish lists''
to help frazzled shoppers find the right gift.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's gift registry lets users roam every area of its site
choosing things they'd like to receive as gifts. Instead of putting
items into a shopping cart and making a purchase, they place items
on a wish list that they can annotate with comments such as ``This
is the gift I really want.'' The users also select people to be
notified by e-mail how to link to their list.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can use Amazon's gift registry, but it's most popular
with teenagers _ a group often cited by adults as the toughest to
shop for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish lists are a great idea,'' says Forrester Research analyst
Ekaterina Walsh. ``It makes sense for parents because they don't
have to figure out what their kids want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about using technology to solve real-world problems,''
says Bob Sacco, marketing vice president of SecretWish.com, a Web
site gift registry for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that are cool among teens that change
daily and parents are constantly perplexed as to what to buy
them,'' says Sacco. ``A gift registry aimed at teens helps the gift
buying process.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens who visit Secret Wish register and shop from a selected
list of online vendors. ``We've created a mall for teens so the
user experience is very easy,'' says Secret Wish president and CEO
Joachim Kim. ``We tried to present products that appeal, products
that speak specifically to teens.
</P>
<P>
   With teenagers, ``the shopping and buying actions are often
separate,'' says Melanie Alshab, president of FastFrog.com, an
Internet company that sets up shop in locals malls. Kids get
scanners to pick out items in participating stores and upload their
choices to the Web for parents and relatives to look over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laziness is the mother of invention,'' says Secret Wish's Kim.
``Buyers ask kids to send a wish list because they are going
shopping that weekend,'' he says. ``I've been begging my nephew to
give me a wish list so I'll know what to get him. Wish lists are
like a virtual Santa's lap for kids who are too big to sit on
Santa's lap anymore.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take 1 of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a VCR can be programmed for the year 2000
by setting it to another year when the days and dates were
identical. Do you have that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's considerable disagreement about this. A widely
reported item in the Old Farmer's Almanac 2000 says that this can
be accomplished by setting the VCR to 1972, when the days of the
week had the same dates as those in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association in Arlington, Va., calls this an urban myth. His advice
for concerned homeowners who enjoy programming their VCRs to tape
future programs is to test the VCR for the Y2K bug by setting the
date forward to Jan. 1, and trying to record a program. If there's
a problem, contact the manufacturer's Web site or toll-free number
for software fixes or to get information about the manufacturer's
product Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The least painful way to know whether a specific device of any
kind _ anything from a coffee marker to a personal computer _ is
Y2K complaint is to check with its manufacturer. This is especially
important in the case of any safety or mechanical device.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an address where I can send to donation to Linda
Tripp's legal defense fund?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Baltimore office of Tripp attorney Joseph Murtha says
donations can be mailed to: Linda R. Tripp Legal Defense Fund, 626
Admiral Drive, Suite 319-A, Annapolis, MD 21401. Checks should be
made out to the Linda R. Tripp Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At one time, I had some stationary with a quotation something
like this: ``In spite of everything, I believe that people are
really good at heart.'' It may have been from Anne Frank. Do you
know the full quotation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anne Frank wrote this in her diary: ``Ideas, dreams and
cherished hopes rise within us, only to be shattered. Yet I keep
them; because in spite of everything, I still believe people are
good at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the pacemaker invented, and by whom?
</P>
<P>
   A: The year was 1952. Paul Zoll, a cardiologist at Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston, was seeking a way to aid cardiac patients
suffering from Stokes-Adams attacks, a breakdown of the heart's
ability to beat regularly. Zoll inserted a bare wire into the
recipient's heart to convey electrical pulses provided by an
external pulse generator. Since the generator had to be plugged
into an electrical outlet, the patient's mobility was severely
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The first battery-powered external pulse generator was developed
in 1958 by Earl Bakken, an electrical engineer, at the request of
C. Walton Lillehei, an open-heart surgeon at the University of
Minnesota Medical School. It was the size of a transistor radio and
operated on flashlight batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Q:A high school friend of mine, Tori Murden, of Louisville, Ky.,
is attempting to become the first woman and the first American to
row solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Can you update me on her
progress?
</P>
<P>
   A: Murden's 12-weeks-plus odyssey ended successfully Dec. 3,
when she reached Guadeloupe after her 3,000-mile trip from the
Canary Islands. Murden is a member of the Sector No Limits Team of
athletes dedicated to testing the outer limits of human endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the background of Barbara Olson, the anti-Clinton
lawyer who wrote ``Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary
Rodham Clinton''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A former federal prosecutor, Olson served as the chief
investigative counsel of the House Committee on Government Reform
and Oversight, where she spearheaded the investigation of the
Clinton administration's White House travel office firings and,
according to her publisher, uncovered what became known as the
``Filegate'' scandal. She also has served as the principal
assistant general counsel and solicitor to the House.
</P>
<P>
   A regular on the TV talk show circuit, Olson, who is in private
law practice, serves as an ongoing legal analyst for MSNBC. She
lives in Great Falls, Va., outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: According to rumor mills, J. Edgar Hoover was a
cross-dresser. Has there ever been any firm evidence to back this
up?
</P>
<P>
   A: The New York Times delved into this subject in a lengthy
article in 1993 in the wake of the best-selling book ``Official and
Confidential'' by Anthony Summers. The book stated that Hoover had
been a transvestite. But as the Times reported, ``There is no solid
proof for the transvestism charges'' as alleged in Summers' book.
More recently (in June 1998), the Times printed an editor's note
saying that previously published assertions about Hoover being a
cross-dresser came from a single, uncorroborated source quoted in a
1993 book, ``and should not have been presented as fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems as if people of every nationality and language say
``OK,'' and it's universally understood. What is its origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins, there are a number of theories. As the dictionary states,
everyone from presidents to plumbers has a pet theory. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson thought it was from the Choctaw Indian language
and should be spelled ``okeh.'' But he apparently convinced few
people to convert to this belief.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Walker Read, a Columbia University professor, theorized
that it originated as an abbreviation for the Old Kinderhook Club,
a political organization supporting James Van Buren for the
presidency in 1840.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Berlitz, the linguist, said it might have come from
Aux Cayes, a port in Haiti famous for its superior rum. This theory
holds that American sailors were so enthusiastic about the rum that
Aux Cayes _ later ``OK'' _ became their expression for approval.
</P>
<P>
   One other theory is said to be the most popular: Andrew Jackson,
while a court clerk in Tennessee, marked O.K. on legal documents as
an abbreviation for the illiterate ``Orl Kerrect.'' But Jackson
never was a court clerk, and he certainly wasn't illiterate, the
dictionary notes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear about ``hurricane hunters'' who fly into
the storms. Who are these people? What kind of aircraft do they
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are members of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron
of the Air Force Reserve, based out of Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi, Miss. They fly Lockheed WC-130 aircraft into tropical
storms and hurricanes to gather meteorological data for the
National Hurricane Center.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of two.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I saw where the family of golfer Jack Nicklaus attended the
funeral of Winnie Palmer, wife of Arnold Palmer. We used to live
near her. I didn't know she was sick. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Winifred ``Winnie'' Palmer, 65, died Nov. 20 of peritoneal
cancer at her home in Unity, Pa. A report in The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette said she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's obituary said she was a philanthropist who
served as a board member of the Latrobe (Pa.) Area Hospital
Charitable Foundation; the Orlando (Fla.) Regional Healthcare
System, which operates the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children and
Women; Adams Memorial Library in Latrobe; and St. Vincent College
in Latrobe. She also was the designer of the Arnold Palmer
Furniture Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Clark, chief executive officer of Latrobe Area Hospital,
said Mrs. Palmer ``quietly helped many people, and the only
stipulation was that a big deal wasn't made of it.'' Two weeks
before she died, Clark said, she asked him what she could do for
the hospital. ``The world has lost a very special person,'' Clark
added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters,
seven grandchildren, and her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that President Clinton is using a hearing aid
in each ear. I'm considering doing the same. What brand and model
does he use?
</P>
<P>
   A: When this subject first came up in 1997, the White House
declined to identify the brand. And Clinton spokesman Steve Boyd
told Q&AMP;A that its position hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Thomas of the American Speech-Language Hearing Association
said the White House probably wasn't revealing the brand because,
when Ronald Reagan was president, there was some ``industry
fallout'' after details about his hearing aids were disclosed. The
obvious reason: competing manufacturers would cry foul. Thomas
recommends asking your audiologist's advice, because the type of
aid that works best for one person may not be recommended for
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   One thing we can tell you: The type of aid Clinton chose is
described as ``completely in-canal.'' The cone-shaped devices are
smaller than a dime and can be inserted and removed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we contact SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer to express our
opinion about the controversial officiating in the Georgia-Georgia
Tech football game?
</P>
<P>
   A: Regular mail, 2201 Civic Center Blvd., Birmingham, AL 35203;
e-mail, feedback(at)secsports.com; telephone, 205-458-3000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact the Second Amendment Foundation, which
promotes the legality of private gun ownership?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the organization at 1-800-426-4302. Or, online, check
its Web site _ www.saf.org _ and use the message format.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu
had released a statement saying it isn't unusual for prostate
cancer to return two years after radiation treatment. I've never
heard that before. Will you expand on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a misstatement of the facts, said Tutu's surgeon, Dr.
Harry Clarke Jr. of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. There is
a failure rate for radiation therapy, he added, but it is ``not a
common occurrence'' and such therapy ``is very effective in most
cases.'' Tutu is a visiting theology professor at Emory, as well as
chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in his home
country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read with interest about the treatment of South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu's recurrence of prostate cancer. What
procedure was used initially to treat him in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dr. Harry Clarke Jr. of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta
described it as ``full-course external beam radiation therapy'' at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Social Security is increasing the retirement age for
receiving full benefits from 65 to 67. Who initiated this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was part of a package of proposals agreed upon in January
1983 by the bipartisan National Commission on Social Security
Reform. Raising the retirement age was approved on an amendment by
Rep. J.J. Pickle (D-Texas). The package was signed into law on
April 20, 1983, by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members were Robert Ball, former Social Security
commissioner; Robert Beck, board chairman and CEO of the Prudential
Insurance Co. of America; Rep. Barber Conable Jr. (R-N.Y.); Sen.
Bob Dole (R-Kan.); Mary Falvey Fuller, member of the 1979 Advisory
Council on Social Security; Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers; Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.); former Rep.
Martha Keys (D-Kan.); Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO; Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N .Y.); Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.);
Alexander Trowbridge, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers and former secretary of commerce; Sen. William
Armstrong (R-Colo.); Rep. Bill Archer (R-Texas); and former Rep.
Joe Waggoner Jr. (D-La.).
</P>
<P>
   Q: What exactly will be the procedure for taking the 2000
Census? Will forms be mailed to us?
</P>
<P>
   A: People with a ``city-style address'' will receive the
questionnaire in the mail, said Bea Piddock of the Census Bureau.
Those without such an address will have it delivered to their home.
A letter advising that the questionnaire is on the way will precede
the actual questionnaire, she added. The timetable: ``about
mid-March.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: This summer, Major League Baseball announced that a Henry
Aaron award would be introduced. But I never heard anything more
about it. Did anyone win it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. This was the first year for the Hank Aaron Award, which
is awarded to the top hitters in each league. In the National
League, Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs was the winner; in the
American League, Manny Ramirez of the Cleveland Indians. The awards
were established in honor of the 25th anniversary of Aaron's
hitting his 715th career home run, breaking Babe Ruth's record.
</P>
<P>
   The award is given to the hitter in each league with the highest
combined total in three categories, home runs, runs batted in, and
hits. Sosa had 180 hits, 141 RBIs and 63 home runs this year;
Ramirez had 174 hits, 165 RBIs and 44 homers. Other criteria, such
as batting average and slugging percentage, may be added in future
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this award to be to hitters what the Cy Young is to
pitchers,'' Aaron said when the winners were announced Oct. 27.
``This is strictly for hitters. Everybody has had an award but the
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Chelsea Clinton dropped out of college? She was in the
news traveling overseas recently with President and Mrs. Clinton at
a time when colleges students were not on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   A: A spokeswoman at the first lady's press office said
information about Chelsea Clinton normally isn't given out, but she
confirmed that the first daughter is still enrolled at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Quentin Crisp died recently. We have always
enjoyed his tapes and TV appearances. Do you have any information
about his last few years?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 90-year-old actor, writer and gay activist died Nov. 21
in Manchester, England. Crisp, who was born in England on Christmas
Day 1908, didn't become widely known until 1968, when he published
his autobiography, ``The Naked Civil Servant.'' It later was made
into a TV play starring John Hurt. After that, Crisp moved to New
York and appeared in such films as ``Orlando,'' playing Queen
Elizabeth I, and Sting's video ``Englishman in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp was in Atlanta in July for performances of ``An Evening
With Quentin Crisp.'' Most recently, he was in the news not for
anything he did himself, but for being the subject of a new one-man
play in London based on his writings. A review of Bush Theatre's
``Resident Alien'' in the Nov. 15 Times of London heaped praise on
the production, especially Bette Bourne as Crisp. The play is
scheduled to close its run on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find the names, addresses, telephone numbers and
e-mail addresses of members of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: Among the possibilities: Call Project Vote Smart's voters'
research hotline, 1-800-622-7627; or try www.visi.com/juan/congress
or www.vote-smart.org/congresstrack/contact or www.capweb.net if
you're online.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the standoff several years ago between federal agents and
Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, Weaver's 14-year-old son was
fatally shot. Was it ever determined who fired the shot?
</P>
<P>
   A: After nearly four years of investigation, Boundary County,
Idaho, authorities in May 1996 said they found the bullet that
killed Sam Weaver. At first, federal agents speculated that the
teen was shot accidentally by his father or by family friend Kevin
Harris during a flurry of gunfire in August 1992. The shootout
occurred while a team of agents was attempting to arrest Randy
Weaver for failing to appear in federal court on an illegal weapons
charge.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Boundary County Sheriff Greg Sprungl said
evidence showed that the boy was killed by a bullet fired from U.S.
Marshal Larry Cooper's 9 mm Colt. ``It is our opinion that Cooper
fired into a brushy area because he was trying to get to his buddy
who had just been shot and was dying,'' Sprungl said. Cooper's
buddy was Deputy Marshal William Degan, who also died in the
shootout. In testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on terrorism in 1995, Cooper flatly denied that he
fired at young Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting wrongdoing, the government later agreed to pay
Randy Weaver and his surviving children $3.1 million for the deaths
of his wife, Vicki, and son. Boundary County prosecutor Denise
Woodbury has said that, even if the marshals killed Sam Weaver,
they were acting in self-defense.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a VCR can be programmed for the year 2000
by setting it to another year when the days and dates were
identical. Do you have that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's considerable disagreement about this. A widely
reported item in the Old Farmer's Almanac 2000 says that this can
be accomplished by setting the VCR to 1972, when the days of the
week had the same dates as those in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing
Association in Arlington, Va., calls this an urban myth. His advice
for concerned homeowners who enjoy programming their VCRs to tape
future programs is to test the VCR for the Y2K bug by setting the
date forward to Jan. 1, and trying to record a program. If there's
a problem, contact the manufacturer's Web site or toll-free number
for software fixes or to get information about the manufacturer's
product Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The least painful way to know whether a specific device of any
kind _ anything from a coffee marker to a personal computer _ is
Y2K complaint is to check with its manufacturer. This is especially
important in the case of any safety or mechanical device.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an address where I can send to donation to Linda
Tripp's legal defense fund?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Baltimore office of Tripp attorney Joseph Murtha says
donations can be mailed to: Linda R. Tripp Legal Defense Fund, 626
Admiral Drive, Suite 319-A, Annapolis, MD 21401. Checks should be
made out to the Linda R. Tripp Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At one time, I had some stationary with a quotation something
like this: ``In spite of everything, I believe that people are
really good at heart.'' It may have been from Anne Frank. Do you
know the full quotation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anne Frank wrote this in her diary: ``Ideas, dreams and
cherished hopes rise within us, only to be shattered. Yet I keep
them; because in spite of everything, I still believe people are
good at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the pacemaker invented, and by whom?
</P>
<P>
   A: The year was 1952. Paul Zoll, a cardiologist at Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston, was seeking a way to aid cardiac patients
suffering from Stokes-Adams attacks, a breakdown of the heart's
ability to beat regularly. Zoll inserted a bare wire into the
recipient's heart to convey electrical pulses provided by an
external pulse generator. Since the generator had to be plugged
into an electrical outlet, the patient's mobility was severely
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The first battery-powered external pulse generator was developed
in 1958 by Earl Bakken, an electrical engineer, at the request of
C. Walton Lillehei, an open-heart surgeon at the University of
Minnesota Medical School. It was the size of a transistor radio and
operated on flashlight batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Q:A high school friend of mine, Tori Murden, of Louisville, Ky.,
is attempting to become the first woman and the first American to
row solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Can you update me on her
progress?
</P>
<P>
   A: Murden's 12-weeks-plus odyssey ended successfully Dec. 3,
when she reached Guadeloupe after her 3,000-mile trip from the
Canary Islands. Murden is a member of the Sector No Limits Team of
athletes dedicated to testing the outer limits of human endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the background of Barbara Olson, the anti-Clinton
lawyer who wrote ``Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary
Rodham Clinton''?
</P>
<P>
   A: A former federal prosecutor, Olson served as the chief
investigative counsel of the House Committee on Government Reform
and Oversight, where she spearheaded the investigation of the
Clinton administration's White House travel office firings and,
according to her publisher, uncovered what became known as the
``Filegate'' scandal. She also has served as the principal
assistant general counsel and solicitor to the House.
</P>
<P>
   A regular on the TV talk show circuit, Olson, who is in private
law practice, serves as an ongoing legal analyst for MSNBC. She
lives in Great Falls, Va., outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: According to rumor mills, J. Edgar Hoover was a
cross-dresser. Has there ever been any firm evidence to back this
up?
</P>
<P>
   A: The New York Times delved into this subject in a lengthy
article in 1993 in the wake of the best-selling book ``Official and
Confidential'' by Anthony Summers. The book stated that Hoover had
been a transvestite. But as the Times reported, ``There is no solid
proof for the transvestism charges'' as alleged in Summers' book.
More recently (in June 1998), the Times printed an editor's note
saying that previously published assertions about Hoover being a
cross-dresser came from a single, uncorroborated source quoted in a
1993 book, ``and should not have been presented as fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems as if people of every nationality and language say
``OK,'' and it's universally understood. What is its origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase
Origins, there are a number of theories. As the dictionary states,
everyone from presidents to plumbers has a pet theory. Some
examples:
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson thought it was from the Choctaw Indian language
and should be spelled ``okeh.'' But he apparently convinced few
people to convert to this belief.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Walker Read, a Columbia University professor, theorized
that it originated as an abbreviation for the Old Kinderhook Club,
a political organization supporting James Van Buren for the
presidency in 1840.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Berlitz, the linguist, said it might have come from
Aux Cayes, a port in Haiti famous for its superior rum. This theory
holds that American sailors were so enthusiastic about the rum that
Aux Cayes _ later ``OK'' _ became their expression for approval.
</P>
<P>
   One other theory is said to be the most popular: Andrew Jackson,
while a court clerk in Tennessee, marked O.K. on legal documents as
an abbreviation for the illiterate ``Orl Kerrect.'' But Jackson
never was a court clerk, and he certainly wasn't illiterate, the
dictionary notes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear about ``hurricane hunters'' who fly into
the storms. Who are these people? What kind of aircraft do they
use?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are members of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron
of the Air Force Reserve, based out of Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi, Miss. They fly Lockheed WC-130 aircraft into tropical
storms and hurricanes to gather meteorological data for the
National Hurricane Center.

   Q: In the standoff several years ago between federal agents and
Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, Weaver's 14-year-old son was
fatally shot. Was it ever determined who fired the shot?
</P>
<P>
   A: After nearly four years of investigation, Boundary County,
Idaho, authorities in May 1996 said they found the bullet that
killed Sam Weaver. At first, federal agents speculated that the
teen was shot accidentally by his father or by family friend Kevin
Harris during a flurry of gunfire in August 1992. The shootout
occurred while a team of agents was attempting to arrest Randy
Weaver for failing to appear in federal court on an illegal weapons
charge.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Boundary County Sheriff Greg Sprungl said
evidence showed that the boy was killed by a bullet fired from U.S.
Marshal Larry Cooper's 9 mm Colt. ``It is our opinion that Cooper
fired into a brushy area because he was trying to get to his buddy
who had just been shot and was dying,'' Sprungl said. Cooper's
buddy was Deputy Marshal William Degan, who also died in the
shootout. In testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on terrorism in 1995, Cooper flatly denied that he
fired at young Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting wrongdoing, the government later agreed to pay
Randy Weaver and his surviving children $3.1 million for the deaths
of his wife, Vicki, and son. Boundary County prosecutor Denise
Woodbury has said that, even if the marshals killed Sam Weaver,
they were acting in self-defense.

   Julia Child was famous for all of her chicken dishes, but most
known for the ``perfect roast chicken.'' Here's her take on that,
with lots of basting. Don't skimp on the butter: it is crucial to
the flavor Child emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   JULIA CHILD'S POULET ROTI1chicken, 3 to 4 pounds, at room
temperature, patted dry
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon minced shallot or scallion
</P>
<P>
   1cup canned chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 500 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Work 2 tablespoons of the butter under the skin of the chicken.
Rub 2 tablespoons of the butter inside the cavity of the chicken
and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over the outside skin of
the chicken. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place chicken breast-side up in a V-shaped roasting rack in a
roasting pan. Cook 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to 375 degrees and baste bird with a combination of
the melted butter and olive oil. Turn breast-side down, and roast
20 minutes. Baste again and turn breast-side up again. Roast 10 to
15 minutes more, testing for doneness by cutting deep into the
flesh between the body and leg. If the juices run clear, the
chicken is done. Remove it from the oven and let sit at room
temperature 10 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the roasting pan. Stir
in minced shallots and cook slowly over medium heat for 1 minute.
Add the broth and boil vigorously, scraping up chicken pieces from
the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Boil until the liquid is
reduced by half. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Use as gravy
for carved chicken.

   Hawaii's statehood in 1959 sent cooks scrambling to be the first
on their block to offer a Polynesian-themed dinner party _ on the
patio. This fried shrimp dish was served at the Polynesian Pavilion
of the 1964 World's Fair in New York. Diners at the pavilion got a
plastic lei to wear.
</P>
<P>
   POLYNESIAN CHIEFTAIN FRIED SHRIMP
</P>
<P>
   1pound large raw shrimp in the shell
</P>
<P>
   3/4teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2teaspoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon powdered ginger
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2to 3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1cup finely grated unsweetened coconut
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   Sweet and sour sauce (bottled)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the shells of the shrimp, but leave their tails intact.
Use a sharp knife to slit their backs and remove the vein. Rinse
under cold running water and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, mix salt, curry powder, ginger and lemon
juice. Add shrimp, stir to coat and refrigerate 2 hours, tossing
once or twice. Drain and reserve the marinade. Dip the shrimp in
cornstarch. Shake off excess. Make a batter of flour, baking
powder, 1/2 cup milk and reserved marinade, adding more milk if
batter is too thick to dip shrimp. Dip the shrimp in the batter,
and roll in coconut.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 1 inch of oil in a deep skillet or frying kettle to 370
degrees. Fry the shrimp, a few at a time, for 3 to 5 minutes, or
until golden brown and the shrimp are cooked. Drain on paper
towels. Serve immediately with sweet and sour sauce or your choice
of dipping sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings.

<P>
   2 cups dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>

spoon, then add brandy-cornstarch mixture. Stir until fondue
thickens. Add seasonings to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to fondue pot; serve immediately with bread and fondue
forks.

 &HT;    You CAN take it with you
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kate Rawlings sputtered out halfway through her
expensive restaurant meal _ a ribeye steak on a mound of mashed
potatoes that could upend the Flintstones' car.
</P>
<P>
   So she asked the waitress for a doggie bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a Depression-era family,'' said the 41-year-old
banker. ``I always take it home with me.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, real live doggies are lucky to get so much as a bone
from their owners' restaurant entrees. Most diners, like Rawlings,
turn their leftovers into a second meal for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nearly two-thirds of Americans take their leftovers
home, and nearly all these people eat the food, according to a
survey commissioned by American Demographics magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get two meals for the price of one,'' says restaurateur
Karen Hilliard of Georgia Grille. Although Hilliard tries to keep
her portions reasonable, she says diners often fill up on
appetizers and homemade bread. ``By the time the entrees come they
may not be hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   But many restaurants, eager to lure value-conscious consumers,
pile it on. If they don't, somebody else will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurants have figured out that the difference between 6
ounces of pasta on the plate and a pound-and-a-half of pasta is not
a lot of money,'' says John Imbergamo, president of the Imbergamo
Group, a restaurant consulting firm in Denver. ``These big-portion
restaurants are not running higher-than-normal food costs. And they
can really blow people away and put a strong value message into
their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that make their names with large portions _ the
Cheesecake Factory, Maggiano's Little Italy _ fill out the plates
with ``nonprotein-based menu items like pasta, mashed potatoes or
rice,'' Imbergamo says. ``Truthfully, does anybody really go to the
Cheesecake Factory because of the quality of the food? They go
because of the quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it may be satisfying to receive so much food, the result
may not be good for you. Chris Rosenbloom, associate professor of
nutrition at Georgia State University, notes that portions often
wildly exceed the standard amounts that are necessary to provide
the fuel our bodies need: a half cup of vegetables, a piece of meat
the size of a deck of cards, a serving of pasta the size of your
fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that hasn't been downsized in America is
restaurant portion sizes,'' he says. ``There's so much competition
for the dining dollar, so Americans have come to expect huge
portions and all the extras _ the bottomless pit salad bowl, the
free soft drink refills, the constantly replenished bread basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Craig, vice president of Weight Watchers International,
counsels dieters to notice the discrepancy between a restaurant
portion and a proper serving the moment it appears and ask for the
doggie bag immediately. ``You can often just split something in
half. It's almost easier to do when you first start.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may be all the easier to do thanks to a minitrend:
fancy bags that make the practice somehow seem more chic.
</P>
<P>
   At the Georgia Grille, Hilliard says the staff dresses up doggie
bags to make them more appetizing. If a dish comes with pretty
sauce squiggles on the plate, the leftovers come with pretty sauce
squiggles in the box.
</P>
<P>
   At Nona's Italian Kitchen in Buckhead, the staff takes the
packaging a step further. The remainders are fitted in properly
sized containers by the staff, outfitted with fresh bread and oil,
placed in a paper shopping bag and secured with a raffia bow. It
ends up looking more like a splurge from a Phipps Plaza boutique
than a box of leftover noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Nona's co-owner Justin Perlino says that he and his partners put
a lot of thought into this lavish look. ``We thought about it
before we opened. People (often package food-to-go) poorly. You get
your doggie bag in a cheap to-go container that leaks inside a bag
that rips. It ends up on the front seat of your car. We package it
so that people can re-create the experience of eating at Nona's at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there's an array of new bags and boxes: the black
plastic octagon with the convenient see-through lid, the sturdy and
oven-safe foil round, the clear plastic pint and quart deli tubs.
It makes sense. With so many containers in the fridge, you want to
easily distinguish the chocolate mousse from the pappardelle
Bolognese.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other restaurants such as Watershed and Floataway Cafe
prefer the natural look of heavy cardboard boxes. Floataway seals
the container with a sticker that reads, ``Woof, Woof ... I'm a
Doggy Box!''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are people asking for to-go containers at every
possible restaurant, they're also asking for them at private
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Good Housekeeping magazine etiquette expert Peggy Post was asked
recently about the appropriateness of taking food home from a
wedding. It seems that guests enjoyed such a long cocktail hour
that they couldn't finish their entrees and asked to have them
boxed up.
</P>
<P>
   Post responded, ``Taking food home from a wedding reception
isn't in keeping with the dignity and elegance of the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone hates to see leftovers _ and so many leftovers _ go
to waste.

 &HT;    Keep your leftovers safe
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With all these doggie bags changing hands, there's
reason to worry about potential food safety risks.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rosenbloom, associate professor of nutrition at Georgia
State University, recommends keeping leftovers no more than two or
three days in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The doggie bag should also get into the fridge _ or into the
doggie, for that matter _ quickly. The United States Department of
Agriculture says perishable food should not be kept at room
temperature longer than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to a movie afterward,'' Rosenbloom says, ``you
can forget the doggie bag.''

 &HT;    Taking kids out to eat doesn't have to leave bad taste in
parents' mouths
 &HT;    By Stephen J. O'Brien
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Before the four Curran kids ever step foot into a
fast-food joint or any other eating establishment, their parents
read them the restaurant-behavior act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a standardized lecture about how they're supposed to
act,'' their mom, Colleen, said as she escorted the youngsters into
Fazoli's restaurant in Waco one recent weekday. ``And we tell them
if they misbehave, we won't go out again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules 11-year-old Rourke, 10-year-old Amanda, 7-year-old
Creed, and 2-year-old Megan are supposed to follow seem simple
enough: Watch your language. The food belongs on your plate or in
your mouth, not in the air. No discussion of bodily functions.
Don't bother other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with a lot of work,'' their father, Troy, said.
``Even though we set down rules, we still have to address things
during the meal. Sometimes it's just whatever they're doing at that
moment that we have to say, 'You need to stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Curran kids usually do. Minus a messy face or two, some
high-pitched giggles and miniature appetites, the Curran table
wasn't much different than any other at Fazoli's.
</P>
<P>
   However, some etiquette experts would suggest the Currans are
the exception these days, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   In today's fast-paced world, the art of parents teaching their
children manners and politeness at the dinner table has been lost,
some say.
</P>
<P>
   How kids behave in fast-food establishments and other
restaurants may not seem like the most pressing social issue in
America today, but restaurant-industry experts say the trend toward
eating out means more and more Americans _ both young and old _
will be sharing the same eating space in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   That puts etiquette for all age groups at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   National Restaurant Association statistics suggest overall sales
will jump by 4.6 percent for the industry this year, a
$16.2-million increase over 1998 to $354 million. Most economists
and restaurant experts credit the increase to a strong economy
coupled with an explosion in the number of eateries available to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurants are developing specialty plates for kids that
come with prizes and toys to ensure the youngsters have a good time
along with the parents. More formal restaurants have even begun
developing cuisine, usually of the simpler, fried chicken variety,
aimed at the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time as they try to satisfy cravings for food with
a bit more bite, some family restaurants are putting new emphasis
on kids,'' Gregg Cobrzynski said in the March issue of Nation's
Restaurant News, a publication of the National Restaurant
Association.
</P>
<P>
   At Miller's Texas Style Steaks in Waco, the menu includes
succulent sirloins, tender T-bones and, of course, french fries and
chicken nuggets for the kids. Owner Brenda Miller said the slew of
child dinners available for $3.95 means plenty of parents show up
with their youngsters for sit-down dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a family restaurant,'' Miller said. ``A lot of parents
bring their kids in on Friday nights and they all seem to enjoy the
food and atmosphere. The kids behave fine.''
</P>
<P>
   For those parents who are having trouble keeping the troops in
line, etiquette experts have a few hints.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they suggest is that every family have a dinner table
where, at least once or twice a week, the entire family sits down
to a meal. The television, computer, stereo and video games should
be turned off. Set down specific rules: close your mouth when you
chew, come to the table clean, no shouting, let other people talk.
Don't complain about the food _ whether you like it or not. Say
``please'' and ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Children should be taught to offer their seats to older people.
They should be told never to push forward in line at a restaurant
or in any other situation. Making fun of a brother or sister at the
table should not be acceptable. And, lastly, kids should eat with
forks and knives.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the youngsters used to following basic rules at home
should make it easier when going public, according to Daisy
Eyebright, author of ``A Manuel of Etiquette.'' ``Those who have
been accustomed to politeness and (good manners) at home are at
their ease in the most polished circles and do not suffer from the
confusion and embarrassment which are almost sure to follow any
lapse of rules of etiquette,'' she said.

 &HT;    International flavors, convenience shape tastes in '50s through
'70s
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ From the birth of fast food in the '50s,
to the cholesterol-conscious '70s, the American food pendulum swung
wide in the third quarter of this century.
</P>
<P>
   We left the dining room behind as we ate frozen dinners in front
of the TV, char-grilled steaks in the back yard, and scarfed down
burgers in our cars.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were ready to celebrate the return of their servicemen
by partying and spending the money that had been so tight.
</P>
<P>
   Tract housing, built to accommodate the thousands of GI-Bill
home buyers, created suburban neighborhoods full of young families.
The baby boom exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The houses featured kitchens with built-in refrigerators and
stoves, and in many cases, an electric dishwasher _
color-coordinated at last. Women gave Tupperware parties. Backyard
patios provided a place to put Dad's new charcoal grill. Dinner
parties for neighbors were informal, and hostesses traded theme
ideas, often tropical. Progressive dinners, where each course was
served in a different home, were a suburban invention.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, steel production returned to auto plants, gas was no
longer rationed, and the country was driving again. Road food
turned into drive-in food. Burger joints, where youthful waitresses
roller-skated up to the driver to take an order, were commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Kroc took over an assembly-line type eatery in 1954 and
McDonald's burgers were soon selling for 15 cents each around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Other chains followed: White Castle in the Midwest and Burger
King in Miami were two that branched across the nation. A
self-named colonel in Kentucky had people everywhere licking their
fingers over his fried chicken. A diner owner in California saw the
potential in roadside eateries that were open all night, and
Denny's was soon part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   On TV, Ed Sullivan shook his head and Elvis shook his pelvis,
while cooks shook Good Seasons salad dressing in glass cruets _ as
recommended on the Kraft Family Hour commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Television had become the pervasive medium. It would change the
foods we ate, and where we ate them. The family dinner hour, once
an institution, began a decline when families stopped talking to
watch ``the tube'' while eating. It would never recover.
</P>
<P>
   Slick food marketing began its ascent. A product could become an
overnight success with the right program placement or celebrity
pitchman. Twinkies was tied in with Howdy Doody throughout the
'50s, and became a staple of lunchboxes for both kids and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Casseroles were the Mom-food of the day. They were portable and
easily served on the buffet _ the new form of party service. Ground
meat was the convenience food of the '50s and for a couple of
decades to come. It was used in meat loaves, chili and that new
sandwich kids were talking about from the school cafeteria _ Sloppy
Joes.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, international flavors began to displace
``American'' foods. The servicemen on tour abroad had experienced
Italian pastas and wines, French stews and crusty breads and
Japanese sukiyaki and sake. They requested it in restaurants.
Chinese and Italian restaurants moved out of their ethnic
neighborhoods and joined suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the decade, Alaska and Hawaii were added as states
and we celebrated with Baked Alaska, a conundrum of a dessert, and
exotic tropical fruit cocktails served with pineapple-topped
burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Americans embraced the space race with fervor. Some bright
marketing exec saw potential in the moon men, and sent Tang around
the Earth in a sipping bag. The orange powder appeared on breakfast
tables around the world immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s found Julia Child making her mark as the matriarch of
everyday gourmet cooking with her TV show, ``The French Chef.''
Classic techniques that taught good cooking as an art form were
novel in America. Wine appreciation increased; roast chicken sales
soared once Julia trilled the recipe for coq au vin. Later in the
decade, Graham Kerr would gallop into TV cooking, and Jeff Smith
would bring frugality to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Parties continued, with hostesses trying to outdo one another in
the kitchen. Cooking magazines such as Sphere, Gourmet and Bon
Appetit satisfied urban cooks with new, trendy recipes and touted
must-have appliances, cookware and tools. The microwave was the
technological wonder of this decade, with predictions it would soon
displace conventional ovens. A convenience movement took hold as
cooks demanded more time away from their chores.
</P>
<P>
   But a political movement was starting to rock the country _
segregation, the Cold War and nuclear threats were a stark contrast
to life in the TV households where mom cooked in pearls and high
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Teens, who rebelled against a rigid, conservative society, found
promise in a youthful president. His sophisticated wife set off new
waves of international cooking when she hired a French chef for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The young people rejected the excesses of their parents,
including the haute cuisine. Rustic foods came of age. People
flocked to communes, where they went to ``live off the land'' a la
Euell Gibbons, who, in his book, ``Stalking the Wild Asparagus,''
promoted foraging for wild plants and berries.
</P>
<P>
   Hippies were eating bean sprouts and ``sun'' burgers made with
tofu. They waved copies of Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring,'' which
touched off an environmental war over pesticide use on crops.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarianism spilled over into the mainstream. Yogurt sales
jumped; bean sprouting jars were sold in supermarkets, and meatless
lasagna appeared on nights other than Friday. Bakers went to
natural food stores to get freshly ground wheat for their wheat
berry breads.
</P>
<P>
   While Aretha Franklin belted out R-E-S-P-E-C-T! ``soul food''
was gaining respect in American cuisine. Okra, sweet potatoes and
black-eyed peas were suddenly fashionable outside the South.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock cemented the youth movement as the war in Vietnam
raged, and catapulted us into the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   A new reason for health foods came from the government:
Carcinogens in foods were scrutinized by the FDA, which banned
cyclamate, a binder used in saccharin products. Artificial
sweeteners in general came under fire; so did grilling over
charcoal. A study of heart patients linked salt to hypertension,
which in turn was linked to heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   But cheese was still good for you, and we ate tons of it at the
trendy wine-and-cheese affairs, and we dipped French bread squares
into the melted goo in fondue pots at every dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants became ``fern bars,'' so named for their hanging
plants. The salad bar was another '70s phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Italian food and restaurants serving anything with a red sauce
blossomed after ``The Godfather'' turned all things Sicilian into a
national obsession. A small but steady trend toward Mexican food
was on its heels; do-it-yourself taco kits hit supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a national preoccupation with food, chefs and cooking
was forming. It would take off in the last quarter of the decade,
making fortunes for restaurateurs and chefs, and bringing
professional cooking techniques into the home.

 &HT;    Latkes the healthy way
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Light, crispy latkes (potato pancakes)
are a traditional food at Hanukkah. Typically fried in oil, they
are representative of the story of a miracle in the Jewish
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story, pagans had extinguished the sacred
menorah in the temple and during a rededication, only one day's
worth of oil could be found to light it. Miraculously, the oil
burned for eight days instead. The eight days of Hanukkah
commemorate the miracle.
</P>
<P>
   For many diners who are on restricted diets or allergic to
certain foods, latkes are a problem. Here we offer alternatives to
the usual potato-egg-flour mixture that most cooks rely on.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs and wheat flour can cause food allergies for many people,
but it's not hard to get around those ingredients with
substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   For those on a low-fat diet, baking the latkes in the oven is a
solution, and using only egg whites in the binding and eliminating
the flour makes them diet-friendly, too.
</P>
<P>
   A select few are allergic to the potatoes themselves; sweet
potatoes are one solution, but hard squashes and even cheese can be
substituted with success. These are so tasty that cooks looking for
something different may want to feature them at the next Hanukkah
buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The following are recipes for nontraditional latkes.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET POTATO LATKES
</P>
<P>
   4large sweet potatoes, unpeeled, washed
</P>
<P>
   2egg whites, beaten until foamy
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   On large holes of grater, or with slaw shredder, shred the sweet
potatoes. Mix, in a medium bowl, with salt and egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil to depth of 1/2 inch in heavy skillet over medium heat.
When oil is ready, form a small patty from the potatoes and drop
into the oil. Flatten slightly with back of spatula. Fry until
potato is brown, about 3 minutes; turn and brown other side. Repeat
with remaining batter.
</P>
<P>
   Drain on paper towels and keep warm in an oven.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a cinnamon-flavored applesauce.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 12 latkes
</P>
<P>
   For dieters on a low-fat diet, the following will work well.
It's also a good recipe for those following the low-carbohydrate
diets.
</P>
<P>
   NONFAT RICOTTA LATKES
</P>
<P>
   115- or 16-ounce container non-fat ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   1cup egg substitute
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable spray for frying
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor fitted with a steel blade (or in a blender
in batches if necessary), process the ricotta cheese, egg
substitute, sugar and vanilla extract. Add flour and process until
batter is very smooth. Scape down sides of container a few times
during processing. (Batter will be thinner than most pancake
batters.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat nonstick skillet over medium heat. Lightly spray with
vegetable spray. For each latke, spoon a 1 1/2- to 2 tablespoon
measure of batter into the greased skillet. Batter will spread to
form a 3-inch circle.
</P>
<P>
   Cook for about 3 minutes, or until a few bubbles appear on the
surface, and the tops are beginning to look dry. (Note: The latkes
will not rise at all.) Turn at once. Cook the latkes briefly on the
second side just until they are golden brown.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm with nonfat yogurt,
fresh fruit or topping of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 24 medium latkes.
</P>
<P>
   (Adapted from the ``New Jewish Holiday Cookbook'' by Gloria
Kaufer Greene, 1999, Times Books, $27.50)
</P>
<P>
   This oven-baked version of the latke, done in a muffin cup, also
saves on fat. For those who cannot tolerate wheat, it's also
flour-free.
</P>
<P>
   POTATO LATKE MUFFINS
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2medium onions, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon paprika, plus a bit more for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4pounds baking potatoes, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2cups applesauce (optional) for serving
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon
vegetable oil in a heavy nonstick skillet. Add onions and saute
over medium-low heat until softened. If pan becomes dry, add 1/2
tablespoon water. Add 1 teaspoon paprika, stir to blend and remove
from heat. Cool.
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely grate the potatoes. Put grated potatoes in a large
strainer and squeeze out excess liquid. Transfer potatoes to a
bowl. Add sauteed onions, eggs, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Oil a nonstick 12-muffin pan, making sure to oil edges of bases.
Using a 1/3 cup measure, add scant measureful of potato mixture to
each muffin cup. Smooth tops lightly. Spoon 1/4 teaspoon oil over
each, and sprinkle with paprika. Bake about 45 minutes or until
brown at edges, and firm.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and run spatula around edges of muffin cups to
release muffins. You can them leave them in the pan 15 to 30
minutes to keep them warm. Serve hot, accompanied by applesauce if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 muffins, or 4 to 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   (Recipe from ``The Low-Fat Jewish Cookbook'' by Faye Levy, 1997,
Potter Books, $24.95.)
</P>
<P>
   This recipe uses a variety of root vegetables and eliminates
white potatoes. They're still fried, however.
</P>
<P>
   ROOT VEGETABLE LATKES
</P>
<P>
   1cup shredded carrot
</P>
<P>
   1cup shredded celeriac (celery root)
</P>
<P>
   1cup shredded parnsip
</P>
<P>
   3/4cup shredded leek (1 medium, trimmed and rinsed)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4cups shredded beets, rinsed and drained well
</P>
<P>
   2cups shredded boniato (Cuban sweet potato)
</P>
<P>
   2large eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup matzo meal
</P>
<P>
   2teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl combine carrots, celeriac, parsnip, leek, beets
and boniato. Add eggs, matzo meal, salt and pepper; mix well.
</P>
<P>
   In a large heavy or cast-iron skillet, over medium heat, heat
vegetable oil. It should be about 1 inch deep.
</P>
<P>
   Form 1/4 cup vegetable mixture into patties and gently slide
into oil. Let cook for 6 to 8 minutes or until golden on one side.
Flip pancakes and continue cooking for 6 to 8 minutes or until
golden. Drain on paper towels or paper bags and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 18 pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Any hard vegetable, such as the hard squashes, could be
used in this recipe. Experiment to your own tastes.

   CHIPOTLE SWEET POTATO SOUP WITH BELL PEPPER-BACON SALSA
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   SALSA:
</P>
<P>
   4 slices bacon
</P>
<P>
   1 small red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   SOUP:
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, smashed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 small white or yellow onions, roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pureed chipotles in adobo
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 large sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   6 cups chicken stock or low-sodium canned chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter, chilled and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lime
</P>
<P>
   To make the salsa, cook the bacon in a large, heavy skillet over
medium heat, turning once, until crisp, about 10 minutes. Crumble
the bacon and reserve. Pour most of the bacon fat into a heat-proof
container, leaving only enough to coat the pan lightly, and
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onion and red pepper to the pan in which the bacon
cooked and saute over medium heat, stirring until brown, about 6
minutes. Season to taste with the salt and pepper. Add the reserved
bacon and the lime juice. Correct the seasonings, transfer to a
small bowl, and set aside at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   To make the soup, return the reserved bacon fat to the same pan
and place over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, onions and
brown sugar, season with the salt and pepper to taste, and saute,
stirring, until the vegetables are brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in
the chipotle puree and wine, and cook over medium heat until the
mixture is reduced by about three-fourths, approximately 6 minutes.
Add the sweet potatoes and stock and simmer until the potatoes are
very soft, 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a hand blender or food processor, puree the soup mixture.
Add the butter one piece at a time, blending again after each
addition, to thicken the soup slightly. Stir in the lime juice and
correct the seasonings. Immediately ladle into bowls, spoon a
portion of the salsa onto each and serve.

   1 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup dark soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Garlic mashers (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   Season the meat with salt and pepper. Heat a medium Dutch oven
or heavy pot over high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil, and swirl
to coat the bottom of the pot. When the oil shimmers, add the meat
and brown on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the meat and wipe out the pot. Add the remaining 1
tablespoon of oil and when the oil shimmers, add the onions,
carrots, celery, black beans, ginger and garlic and saute,
stirring, until soft, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and
season with the salt and pepper to taste. Add the wine, stir and
cook to reduce it by 20 percent, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the soy sauce
and correct the seasonings. Return the meat to the pot, add water
to cover, and cook, covered, until the meat is tender, 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the mashers among 4 large pasta bowls. Cover with the
stew and serve.

<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan, combine the potatoes with enough water to
cover and salt lightly. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook
until the tip of a knife inserted into the potatoes meets no
resistance, 30 to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the oil
and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil shimmers, add
the garlic and saute, stirring, until golden, about 2 minutes. Add
the cream and reduce by one-third over low heat, about 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl or the bowl of a mixer and

 &HT;    Food Network personality has cooked up impressive career
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He has fond and vivid memories of rolling
thousands of egg rolls on the ping-pong table of his Kettering home
for Dayton's annual World A'fair event.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year there was a power outage and we rolled them by
candlelight,'' says Ming Tsai, who is calling from the car on his
way to a book signing in Los Angeles. ``I love that international
festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Daytonian-area resident is still rolling in dough,
but these days we're not just talking egg rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Ming, who hosts the popular ``East Meets West With Ming Tsai''
on the Food Network _ the cable channel boasts 42 million viewers _
has become one of America's top celebrity chefs. He was profiled in
The New Yorker in November and is a regular contributor to CBS's
new Early Show with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for the Emmy Award-winning show host to receive
2,000
</P>
<P>
   e-mails a week from fans.
</P>
<P>
   He also runs Blue Ginger, a Wellesley, Mass., restaurant that
was named ``Best New Restaurant'' by Boston Magazine, and has just
authored his first cookbook, Blue Ginger: East Meets West Cooking
with Ming Tsai (Clarkson Potter, $32.50).
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Esquire's John Mariana labeled him ``the foremost
interpreter of East-West cuisine today.'' Ming describes his
cooking as a happy mingling of Chinese, Southeast Asian, Japanese,
French and American culinary traditions.
</P>
<P>
   If you watch him on TV, you'll hear frequent references to his
growing-up days in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to grow up,'' he says, ``but there was
not a lot of great Chinese food.''
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Iris Tsai, attempted to remedy that by offering Chinese
cooking classes and opening the Mandarin Kitchen in the Arcade
downtown. (She sold the business about 10 years ago and she and
husband Stephen, a chief scientist at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base, have moved to Newport Beach, Calif.)
</P>
<P>
   Their son attended elementary school in Kettering and the Miami
Valley School in Washington Twp. before transferring to prep school
(Andover) in his sophomore year. From there, he studied mechanical
engineering at Yale University (his dad and grandfather both went
there), then eventually decided to switch to cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in my family cooks,'' Ming says. ``My dad, my
grandparents, everyone except my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   His first cooking endeavor, at age 5, was a Duncan Hines cake
mix. By 8, he says he was attempting fried rice, noting, ``Maybe
it's because I was always hungry as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teens, he'd come home from school and work in his
mother's restaurant _ as chef, as manager. ``We also did a lot of
catering and all the festivals and affairs on the (Courthouse)
Square. It was a great way to make a little cash and spend time
with the family.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite Dayton cuisine? ``Skyline Chili and Slyders at
White Castle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsai studied at the prestigious Cordon Bleu in Paris, earned a
master's degree in hotel administration and hospitality marketing
at Cornell and by 1992 was working as a chef _ first in San
Francisco, later in Palo Alto, Calif., and Sante Fe, N.M. He moved
to the Boston area in 1998 and now lives in Needham with his wife
Polly (Talbott), also from Dayton. (The two were introduced by
Polly's brother _ Ming's squash coach at Yale _ because she had
studied Chinese in college.)
</P>
<P>
   Tsai typically heads for New York every three months, where he
tapes two weeks of shows for the Food Network. ``The taping is a
hoot. It's easy because 30 people work on the show and everyone is
working to help.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not so easy, he admits, is coming up with 180 recipes for
90 shows each year.
</P>
<P>
   He does his research with a lot of magazine and cookbook
reading, going to dives and ethnic restaurants. ``There's no such
thing as plagiarism in the chef world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ming believes Americans have more sophisticated palettes these
days because of technology and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some research shows that people are going to restaurants more
often; some shows they're spending a lot on home kitchens. Food has
become a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his goal is to demystify Asian techniques and
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that you don't bring in all these Asian spices
till you understand how they are traditionally used,'' he cautions.
</P>
<P>
   Take sesame oil, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chinese cooking, you tend to use a tablespoon for 1 or 2
quarts of chicken stock. But see some cooks discover it and drizzle
it all over salad like it was olive oil and it completely ruins the
taste and the dish!''
</P>
<P>
   Ming says only about 10 percent of those who watch the Food
Network actually cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like CNN, people have it on and there's a comfort
level because everyone eats, it's part of daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ming says at least two rewarding things have come out of his
career: ``Even though I hope I don't look like Barney, kids love to
watch the show and I love kids. And a lot of culinary students have
told me that I'm the reason they went to culinary school.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being a celebrity, Ming maintains he's not recognized in
cities _ like his current hometown of Boston _ where the Food
Network isn't broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of being a celeb in cities where he is known?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always get a table at restaurants,'' he says. ``That's
more important than the money or fame!''
</P>

 &HT;    Calories aren't only alcohol worry
 &HT;    By Karen Collins, M.S., R.D.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's the best way to cut down on the calories I'm getting
from alcohol?
</P>
<P>
   A: The alcoholic drinks highest in calories are mixed drinks
made with cola, lemon-lime soda, or sweet mixes such as Tom Collins
or whiskey sour. Lowest-calorie choices are table wines, followed
by light beer or 80-proof liquor mixed with water or club soda.
</P>
<P>
   But calorie content is not the only problem with alcohol _
drinking too much seems to increase risk of many cancers of the
digestive system as well as breast cancer. Safe levels of alcohol
consist of no more than one standard-size drink per day for women,
and no more than two standard drinks per day for men. No matter
what you drink, by drinking more slowly to limit the amount, you
save calories and promote your total health.
</P>
<P>
   Juices and regular soda are some alternatives to alcohol, but
the 150 calories in each 12-ounce glass add up quickly. Consider
lower-calorie nonalcoholic choices such as club soda, tomato juice
(or nonalcoholic Bloody Marys), sparkling water or iced tea, if
available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I keep my calories low enough, can I lose weight without
exercise? I'm a born couch potato!
</P>
<P>
   A: It's definitely possible for most people to lose weight
without exercise by using low-calorie diets. The real question is
what the long-term results would be.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that without exercise, about a quarter of
weight loss can be muscle. Since muscle is the tissue that bums the
most calories, that means that you would not be able to eat as much
and maintain your new weight as someone of the same weight but with
more muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies show physical activity as one of the best
predictors of who can maintain a lower weight.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, regular physical activity of some sort can help lower
your risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and several forms of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there are other ways to get some exercise without turning
to whatever form of activity you've tried in the past. Aim for a
slow, gradual start. Is there a pretty place you could enjoy
walking? What about beginner sports or dance lessons?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere there is surely an activity that you would enjoy doing
to help keep you fit and healthy _ try to find at least one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What supplements are the best antioxidants?
</P>
<P>
   A: Antioxidants are receiving a lot of attention because they
may play an important role in preventing cancer and other diseases
by destroying highly reactive substances called free radicals that
form in our bodies and damage our cells. Scientists have discovered
that vitamins C and E, beta carotene and its many carotenoid
cousins, the mineral selenium, and a host of phytochemicals all can
act as antioxidants, but don't let supplement advertisements
convince you that the best types and amounts have been pinpointed.
We have a lot more to learn before we can get that specific.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know, however, is that a plant-based diet _ a diet
centered around lots of vegetables, fruits and whole grains _
supplies the antioxidants and whatever other substances may be
important to effectively lower risk of cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins, M.S.,
R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research. This column
originally ran in The Austin American-Statesman, Austin, Texas.

   FOOD-LATKES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Light, crispy latkes
(potato pancakes) are a traditional food at Hanukkah. Typically
fried in oil, they are representative of the story of a miracle in
the Jewish tradition. The story goes thatAccording to the story,
pagans had extinguished the sacred menorah in the temple and during
a rededication, only one day's worth of oil could be found to light
it. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days instead. The eight
days of Hanukkah commemorate the miracle. (Palm Beach Post)

   FOOD-CENTURY _ From the birth of fast food in the '50s, to the
cholesterol-conscious '70s, the American food pendulum swung wide
in the third quarter of this century. We left the dining room
behind as we ate frozen dinners in front of the TV set,
char-grilled steaks in the backyard, and scarfed down burgers in
our cars. Americans were ready to celebrate the return of their
servicemen by partying and spending the money that had been so
tight. Tract housing, built to accommodate the thousands of GI-Bill
home buyers, created suburban neighborhoods full of young families.
The Baby Boom exploded. The houses featured kitchens with built-in
refrigerators and stoves, and in many cases, an electric dishwasher
_ color-coordinated at last. Women gave Tupperware parties.
Backyard patios provided a place to put Dad's new charcoal grill.
Dinner parties for neighbors were informal, and hostesses traded
theme ideas, often tropical. Progressive dinners, where each course
was served in a different home, were a suburban invention. (Palm

   EATWITH-KIDS _ WACO, Texas _ In today's fast-paced world, the
art of parents teaching their children manners and politeness at
the dinner table has been lost, some say. How kids behave in
fast-food establishments and other restaurants may not seem like
the most pressing social issue in America today, but
restaurant-industry experts say the trend toward eating out means
more and more Americans _ both young and old _ will be sharing the
same eating space in the years to come. That puts etiquette for all
age groups at a premium. (O'Brien, Waco Tribune-Service) MOVED

   FOOD-LATKES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Light, crispy latkes
(potato pancakes) are a traditional food at Hanukkah. Typically
fried in oil, they are representative of the story of a miracle in
the Jewish tradition. The story goes thatAccording to the story,
pagans had extinguished the sacred menorah in the temple and during
a rededication, only one day's worth of oil could be found to light
it. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days instead. The eight
days of Hanukkah commemorate the miracle. (Palm Beach Post)

   FOOD-CENTURY _ From the birth of fast food in the '50s, to the
cholesterol-conscious '70s, the American food pendulum swung wide
in the third quarter of this century. We left the dining room
behind as we ate frozen dinners in front of the TV set,
char-grilled steaks in the backyard, and scarfed down burgers in
our cars. Americans were ready to celebrate the return of their
servicemen by partying and spending the money that had been so
tight. Tract housing, built to accommodate the thousands of GI-Bill
home buyers, created suburban neighborhoods full of young families.
The Baby Boom exploded. The houses featured kitchens with built-in
refrigerators and stoves, and in many cases, an electric dishwasher
_ color-coordinated at last. Women gave Tupperware parties.
Backyard patios provided a place to put Dad's new charcoal grill.
Dinner parties for neighbors were informal, and hostesses traded
theme ideas, often tropical. Progressive dinners, where each course
was served in a different home, were a suburban invention. (Palm
Beach Post). 70. WITH PHOTOS.

   EATWITH-KIDS _ WACO, Texas _ In today's fast-paced world, the
art of parents teaching their children manners and politeness at
the dinner table has been lost, some say. How kids behave in
fast-food establishments and other restaurants may not seem like
the most pressing social issue in America today, but
restaurant-industry experts say the trend toward eating out means
more and more Americans _ both young and old _ will be sharing the
same eating space in the years to come. That puts etiquette for all
age groups at a premium. (O'Brien, Waco Tribune-Service) MOVED

 &HT;    Ask the experts for good wine gifts under $10
 &HT;    By Dale Rice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The holiday gift-giving season is upon us and,
if there's a wine aficionado on your list, just the idea of trying
to pick one bottle from thousands can be enough to send you rushing
toward the tie rack or the perfume counter.
</P>
<P>
   Slow down. Wine is one of the easiest gifts to purchase. Just
stop by a local wine merchant and ask for help. Tell him or her how
much you want to spend and that you'd like something interesting
for a gift. Whether your budget is less than $10 or more than $50,
the wine expert will be delighted to make suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   I want to emphasize that less-than-$10 point. Many people who
don't regularly shop for wine assume that it must be expensive to
be good. But that's not true. One local merchant recently
recommended several wines under $10 to me and each was enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   So whether you want to spend $10 or $100, there's something out
there to please the palate. And take it from me, the recipient will
appreciate the effort.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for other gift options, how about a book? Here
are some appealing items that have crossed my desk in recent
months:
</P>
<P>
   The revised and updated second edition of ``Wine Spectator's
California Wine'' by James Laube (Wine Spectator Press, $39.95) is
a comprehensive guide with tasting notes for 5,000 wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terroir'' by James E. Wilson (University of California Press,
$50), a product of the Wine Appreciation Guild, is a serious look
at the role of geology, climate and culture in the making of French
wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wine Lover's Cookbook'' by Sid Goldstein (Chronicle Books,
$22.95), well-organized and beautifully photographed, is a
collection of 100 original recipes designed to pair with and
showcase 13 popular varietals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharing the Vineyard Table'' by Carolyn Wente and Kimball
Jones (Ten Speed Press, $29.95), a seasonal approach to cooking
with appropriate wine notes, is aptly subtitled ``A Celebration of
Wine and Food from the Wente Vineyards Restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the millennium closing in, if you know someone who'd
like to learn more about champagne, there are options at both ends
of the spectrum:
</P>
<P>
   ``Christie's World Encyclopedia of Champagne and Sparkling
Wine'' (Wine Appreciation Guild, $50) is a sophisticated and
attractive guide to bubblies, arranged by country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champagne for Dummies'' by Ed McCarthy (IDG Books, $16.99) is
an informative guide for those who want to learn about sparkling
wine in a simple and direct way.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you want to give a year's worth of advice, there's
the desktop ``365 Great Wines Calendar'' from Workman Publishing
($9.95), featuring a wine a day (250 of them under $10) with basic
information and descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Uncorking tradition
</P>
<P>
   In France, it's the law. No Nouveau Beaujolais can be sold
before the third Thursday of November.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, it has been tradition to honor the same
release date _ printed distinctly across the top of some vintners'
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Austin's Central Market, which began
selling this year's Nouveau Beaujolais on Wednesday, Nov. 17, a day
ahead of everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a faux pas,'' said Central Market spokeswoman Nona
Evans. The wine staff, she explained, had prepared a display and
covered it, planning to reveal it on Nov. 18. Instead, ``one of the
nonwine folks'' removed the wraps, permitting it to be sold ahead
of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was poor communication on our part,'' Evans said. ``We have
done double-duty to make sure folks understand the importance and
meaning of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   What next?
</P>
<P>
   Is this progress or what? Just in time for the new millennium,
7-Eleven is introducing its own sparkling wine from France. (No,
I'm not making this up.)
</P>
<P>
   The Mieux sparkler, with a suggested retail price of $6.99,
comes a year after the national convenience store chain entered the
wine market with a selection of domestic and imported wines ranging
from $5 to $15. Over that time, the company reports, wine sales at
7-Eleven have increased nearly 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the nation's No. 1 beer retailer has hit on a good
thing.

 &HT;    Giving dignity to the dead
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Willie Arnold slows his Grand Am and nods toward
a narrow slope that drops sharply into a grove of trees. At its
edge, a foot-tall concrete block marked with a 29 juts from the
ground like a molar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mostly bury kids here,'' Arnold says. ``It's short and
they can fit a lot of them in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Death is not proud at Dayton's Westmont Cemetery. There are no
gravestones etched with tender words, no soaring stone angels or
stately mausoleums. Only numbered cubes, spaced about 30 feet
apart, indicate that 2,566 of the city's poor lie beneath the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   This is a potter's field, a no-frills burial ground for the
penniless and the forgotten. It lies on city jail property, and
about five times a year, inmates crack its soil and lower another
wooden box into the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Those buried here have died in nursing homes and hospitals, in
lonely apartments and on the street. They have no money, or as far
as anyone can tell, no family. Their cases are marked
``indigent/unclaimed'' and fall upon the desk of Montgomery County
coroner's investigator Harry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A former cop, Brown fields about 20 such cases a year, using a
detective's ingenuity to untangle sad webs of poverty and
estrangement. A rap sheet might disclose a sister who hasn't spoken
to the dead man in years. A fingerprint can pinpoint the identity
beneath a fake name. In the recent case of an illegal alien killed
on Interstate 75, a letter discovered in his apartment led to his
mother in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown finds relatives, he asks if they want to assume
responsibility for the body. It is an expensive decision: The
average funeral costs nearly $5,800.
</P>
<P>
   One elderly man's son, reached in Nebraska after Brown followed
a trail of disconnected phone numbers, said he would be glad to
take care of everything. The sister of a General Motors retiree
didn't want to be bothered _ until she learned he had left behind
two suitcases filled with bonds and $70,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed up the next day,'' Brown says.
</P>
<P>
   When the family can't or won't take charge of the funeral, Brown
digs into the dead person's finances, searching for insurance plans
or bank account statements. If the person owned a house, it can be
sold to pay for the burial. The federal government picks up the tab
for veterans, as the state does for Medicaid recipients. Everyone
else becomes the responsibility of the city, village or township in
which they live.
</P>
<P>
   Brown contacts local funeral homes willing to accept the $725 to
$750 government burial fee. Dayton's Bradford-Connolly and Glickler
Funeral Home is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Glickler says he takes a loss for these funerals but
considers them a public service. He'll do a cremation if the
deceased or his family expressed that wish, but the standard is
burial in a fiberboard coffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the burials are much more costly, I still go that
route,'' he says. ``(Cremation) might violate their religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all Miami Valley communities bury their unclaimed or
indigent dead in private cemeteries. Only Dayton _ which sees most
of the cases _ has its own potter's field.
</P>
<P>
   The term comes from the Gospel of Matthew. The chief priests of
the Pharisees bought ``the potter's field'' as a burial ground for
strangers with the 30 pieces of silver Judas Iscariot cast back at
them. This origin, for some, gives the phrase a derisive stain:
Westmont Cemetery got its name because a jail superintendent's wife
hated the Biblical appellation.
</P>
<P>
   The graveyard opened in 1943, when the jail was a working farm,
and it has maintained its pastoral character. When you pass through
the motorized gate off Gettysburg Avenue _ entrance is by
appointment _ a road twists past bright brown cattle inmates still
raise for slaughter, past felled trees inmates chop and sell for
firewood.
</P>
<P>
   After a quarter-mile, the road ends at a four-acre meadow,
bordered on three sides by forest and studded throughout with
cryptic numbered cubes.
</P>
<P>
   The markers tell jail officials, if not the public, who is
buried where. That is necessary should a person's relatives finally
claim him, something acting jail superintendent Willie Arnold says
has happened twice in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Once, a woman came to bury her brother elsewhere. But because
he, like everyone at Westmont, was buried in a wooden coffin and
wooden vault (private cemeteries use cement or metal vaults),
``wasn't nothing (left) but bones,'' Arnold says. The woman
identified her brother by a necklace.
</P>
<P>
   The last person buried here was a man named Nathaniel Jones Jr.
He was 38, a well-liked dishwasher at Ryan's Family Steak House in
Vandalia. He didn't show up for work Sept. 19, and when his sister
checked on him, she found him stretched lifeless and cold across a
bed. The coroner ruled his death an accidental cocaine overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had no insurance, and his family, already strained from
burying another relative two weeks earlier, couldn't afford another
funeral. So on Sept. 23, about a dozen relatives and co-workers
gathered at Westmont to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' sister, Estella Ervin, says the ceremony was quick and of
little comfort. The casket was closed because the burial fee didn't
allow for embalming, and mourners were hustled out of Westmont
before the body was interred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't what I wanted for him,'' she says. ``I didn't like
the area. It just didn't look like no graveyard place, no
cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   She is trying to save money to have her brother moved, a
sentiment jail officials often hear. But it rarely happens. In most
cases, family and friends move on. The plastic flowers they spike
into the ground fade in the sun, the wooden crosses they mount
swell with the rain and break. The dead fade from memory, if they
were ever there at all.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the jail staff in 1992 mounted a plaque upon a large,
pear-shaped stone at the end of the road. It reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember me as you walk by
</P>
<P>
   As you are now, so once was I
</P>
<P>
   As I am now, soon you must be
</P>
<P>
   So walk on by, but think of me''
</P>

   THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED _ Columnist
James Garcia didn't know what to expect when he attended a recent
Republican presidential debate in Tempe, Ariz. ``It seemed like a
good opportunity to catch a glimpse of the new kinder,
compassionate and more inclusive GOP in action,'' Garcia writes.
Instead, Garcia was struck by the topics not mentioned by the
candidates. For example, they failed to discuss the ``guest
worker'' program under consideration in Arizona that would allow
laborers from Mexico and elsewhere to receive temporary work visas
so they can take jobs in the United States. The candidates also
failed to address the controversy over the future of bilingual
education in the state.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT GAYS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Family-values and
religious-right advocates are in an uproar over the publication and
distribution of a 12-page booklet, ``Just the Facts About Sexual
Orientation,'' to the superintendents of nearly 15,000 school
districts nationwide. The main premise of the booklet is the simple
fact that homosexuality is neither abnormal nor a mental illness _
a fact that is endorsed by a dozen of the nation's leading
professional health, mental-health and educational organizations.
``Just the Facts'' makes a case for acceptance of, and respect for,
gay and lesbian youths. ``No wonder the right wing is in an
uproar,'' writes columnist Chuck Colbert. ```Just the Facts'
debunks misinformation about homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS COME IN ALL SHAPES, SIZES AND COLORS _
``Housewife, banker, mechanic, doctor, lawyer, merchant or Indian
chief, we all become people with special interests when the
national elections roll around,'' writes columnist Tim Giago. In
this commentary, Giago discusses the current presidential
candidates and who he thinks will get most of the Native-American
vote. ``Bradley would best serve the special interests of the
Indian people. Gore and McCain would be excellent alternatives.
However, we are still months away from Election 2000, and many
things can happen between now and then,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK ON POSSIBLE AIDS ORIGIN IN AFRICA RECALLS SYPHILIS
EXPERIMENT AT HOME. This week, columnist Vernon Jarrett takes
another look at the controversial book ``The River: A Journey to
the Source of HIV and AIDS'' (Little Brown &AMP; Co.), in which author
Edward Hooper offers his theory on how AIDS began. Jarrett believes
that the content of the book resurrects the suspicion among
darker-skinned people that in recent history they have been used as
guinea pigs for scientific research. To bolster this argument,
Jarrett cites the infamous ``Tuskegee Syphilis Study'' of 1932 in
which 623 rural, unlettered black men in Macon County, Ala., took
part in a scientific study of this sexually transmitted disease.
Two-thirds of the participants were left untreated, and
consequently many died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   IN A KIMCHEE JAR, A LESSON ABOUT LIFE. In this poignant essay
from A. Magazine, writer Hugh Son reflects on his tumultuous
relationship with his father, an immigrant from South Korea. ``When
a boy and his father look at each other, they sometimes see a
mirror reflection,'' he writes. ``The burgeoning young man sees in
the older gentleman his unchangeable past and his malleable future.
He despises and reveres his father, only as he singularly loves and
hates himself. He can see how he is growing tall and strong and new
to the world, just as his father is losing hair and becoming
thinner with years.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fall TV lineup is bursting at the seams with
women who are passionate about fashion and costume designers who
are meeting their needs _ not only with designer labels, vintage
looks and brand names, but with lots of sexy clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the fall shows will produce the next ``Y''
necklace, Jennifer Aniston haircut or Ally McBeal's short skirt is
still a question, but this season's offerings are still bound to
amuse viewers who focus on what the characters wear as much as on
what they say and whom they covet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the looks now popping up on the small screen are Vera
Wang and Zandra Rhodes gowns, full karate-style pants, cropped
cargo pants, Levi's L-2 line and 701 brands, trendy leathers, vinyl
and fake fur. In addition, there are Zelda velvet jackets,
Native-American pieces and over-the-top looks such as Moschino's
fur-trimmed sweaters and leopard pants.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designers say they scour both coasts, Canada and Europe
for hot looks and vintage pieces. Neiman Marcus, Betsey Johnson,
Patricia Field, Bebe, BCBG, Holt Renfrew, Decades, Wasteland, Jet
Rag, Saks Fifth Avenue, Urban Outfitters, Gucci and Diesel are
among their favorite haunts. Some costumers even design their own
clothes for their characters.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a look that will take off is less of a concern to most
costume designers than simply doing their job, which is wardrobing
their characters week after week.
</P>
<P>

designers' favorite shops.

Morrison said, describing a delicate diamond-and-gold pendant
created for Ward by Los Angeles designer Devon Page McCleary.

<P>
   Ward's 14-year old daughter, played by Julia Whelan, wears a lot

contemporary for high school kids.''

Angeles designers, including skirts, sweaters and dresses from

</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Alexandra Welker.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: ``I'm designing a lot of her clothes, which is a luxury
in TV,'' said Welker, who is using trendy leathers, vinyl and fake
fur. Her custom pieces range from a skin-baring burgundy suede top
to low-slung black leather pants and a zipper-trimmed lambskin
jumpsuit. Additional separates include an embroidered and fringed
olive silk skirt by Catherine, which Gershon wears with a John
Eshaya T-shirt, Diesel denim jacket and knee-high Charles David
boots.
</P>
<P>
   The show's two other sleuths, played by Paula Marshall and Paula
Jai Parker, appear in an array of labels and silhouettes that
includes Emporio Armani suits and knee-length pencil-slim skirts;
more suits from Tahari, Calvin Klein and Oscar de la Renta; fitted

</P>
<P>
   Stores: Welker's retail finds include a number of Gucci pieces,

that is ``a cross between a scuba and motorcycle jacket.'' In Los
Angeles, Welker shops vintage stores, such as Decades, Wasteland,
Jet Rag and Aardvarks, as well as Neiman Marcus, Barneys, Saks,
Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Fred Segal and American Rag. When in New
York, she shops The Find boutique, vintage stores and small

includes fitted Zelda velvet jackets, Calvin Klein skirts and
flat-front pants, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein blouses or vintage
Forties shirts and Katayone Adeli sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   As the series' ``young ambitious lawyer,'' Julie Warner wears
``more traditional power suits _ Emporio Armani, Donna Karan,
Tahari,'' Bass said, noting her footwear is a combination of Robert
Clergerie, Prada and Miu Miu.
</P>
<P>
   For Dixie Carter, cast as a country-and-western
singer/convict-turned-lawyer, ``anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very flamboyant,'' said Bass, rattling off a source list
that includes Rifat Ozbek, Todd Oldham, St. John and Valentino.
``Then I mix it with something I find on Hollywood Boulevard to
make it really crazy.'' There are also such items as a Moschino
fur-trimmed sweater and Cache leopard skin pants and red bustier.
Carter's accessories range from bold pieces of St. John jewelry to
``classic Chanel bags in every color.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores: Quinlan's shoes, from Barneys private label collection,

<P>
   Costume designer: Jane Janiger.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: Cynthia Rowley and Nanette Lapore, both ``personal
friends'' of Douglas', according to Janiger, are well represented
on the show. Predominant silhouettes include slipdresses paired
with everything from BCBG shoes to black spandex Gucci boots or
colorful Yves Saint Laurent boots. Additional Gucci pieces include
a pair of '60s-inspired velvet pants and matching purse that
Douglas wears with a Bette Page fringed top. From Versace, there
are miniskirts and a strapless black wool pinstripe jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: Going for an ``offbeat'' look, Janiger said she is
making some pieces and shopping a range of stores that includes
Playclothes in Studio City, for her vintage finds, and Loehmann's.

   Clothes: There are silk-satin, back-baring halter tops from
Urban Outfitters on Melrose, which Pazdernik combines with black
Theory pants (``cropped at the ankle to give that fresh funky
look'') and Steve Madden's black thick-heeled thong wedges.
Carpenter's jewelry statement is a mix of a Nike men's sports watch
with beaded bracelets from Madison and Jennifer Kaufman in Los
Angeles and Urban Outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   Pants include Earl Jeans worn with rolled up cuffs.
Fringe-trimmed Levi's are worn oversized ``so they hang down past
her belly button.'' And among the Daryl K pants is a black twill
pair with a gray stripe around one thigh.
</P>
<P>
   There are also denim jackets from Levi's and denim-style cord
jackets from Theory and Katayone Adeli. Additional Adeli pieces
include soft cotton-knit novelty tank tops and straight-leg pants.
And there are Calvin Klein camisoles ``in every color I could
find,'' Pazdernik noted. Carpenter's dressier outfits include a
Barneys black strapless satin-voile dress worn with an XOXO black
crocheted shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: A favorite outfit includes a long Amy Jean denim skirt
with suede inserts, from Traffic in the Beverly Center, combined
with an ``ethnic'' beaded halter tank from Lisa Kline, on Robertson

such thrills as the Fendi ``baguette'' bag in its many
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designers: Patricia Field and Rebecca Field (no relation
to each other).
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: The show's popularity is high, and viewers, according
to Patricia Field, have responded to a number of fashion
statements, including the gold ``name'' necklace that was made for
Sarah Jessica Parker's character, as well as a Donna Karan
``invisible-strap'' dress.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is what Patricia Field calls ``the bag of the year''
_ the Fendi baguette Parker carried for most of the season in many
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: The overall look for the show is ``hippie rock 'n' roll
couture. It could be a $5 shawl with a $400 pair of shoes _ a mix
of a whole range of things,'' Patricia Field noted, describing a
Parker outfit that mixes a leather halter top from a Patricia Field
store with an Alberta Feretti taffeta ballgown skirt.
</P>

from Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and Ralph Lauren. Skirts are knee-length and
the color palette includes black, white, bone and red.

   LOS ANGELES _ The fall TV lineup is bursting at the seams with
women who are passionate about fashion and costume designers who
are meeting their needs _ not only with designer labels, vintage
looks and brand names, but with lots of sexy clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the fall shows will produce the next ``Y''
necklace, Jennifer Aniston haircut or Ally McBeal's short skirt is
still a question, but this season's offerings are still bound to
amuse viewers who focus on what the characters wear as much as on
what they say and whom they covet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the looks now popping up on the small screen are Vera
Wang and Zandra Rhodes gowns, full karate-style pants, cropped
cargo pants, Levi's L-2 line and 701 brands, trendy leathers, vinyl
and fake fur. In addition, there are Zelda velvet jackets,
Native-American pieces and over-the-top looks such as Moschino's
fur-trimmed sweaters and leopard pants.

wardrobe to match for Illeana Douglas, who plays a
former-child-star-turned-prostitute-turned-movie exec.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Jane Janiger.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: Cynthia Rowley and Nanette Lapore, both ``personal
friends'' of Douglas', according to Janiger, are well represented
on the show. Predominant silhouettes include slipdresses paired
with everything from BCBG shoes to black spandex Gucci boots or
colorful Yves Saint Laurent boots. Additional Gucci pieces include
a pair of '60s-inspired velvet pants and matching purse that
Douglas wears with a Bette Page fringed top. From Versace, there
are miniskirts and a strapless black wool pinstripe jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: Going for an ``offbeat'' look, Janiger said she is
making some pieces and shopping a range of stores that includes
Playclothes in Studio City, for her vintage finds, and Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Angel'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Network: WB.
</P>
<P>
   Concept: In this ``Buffy the Vampire'' spin-off, Charisma
Carpenter is a struggling actress with moxie and a bohemian-chic
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer: Jessica Pazdernik.
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: There are silk-satin, back-baring halter tops from
Urban Outfitters on Melrose, which Pazdernik combines with black
Theory pants (``cropped at the ankle to give that fresh funky
look'') and Steve Madden's black thick-heeled thong wedges.
Carpenter's jewelry statement is a mix of a Nike men's sports watch
with beaded bracelets from Madison and Jennifer Kaufman in Los
Angeles and Urban Outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   Pants include Earl Jeans worn with rolled up cuffs.
Fringe-trimmed Levi's are worn oversized ``so they hang down past
her belly button.'' And among the Daryl K pants is a black twill
pair with a gray stripe around one thigh.
</P>
<P>
   There are also denim jackets from Levi's and denim-style cord
jackets from Theory and Katayone Adeli. Additional Adeli pieces
include soft cotton-knit novelty tank tops and straight-leg pants.
And there are Calvin Klein camisoles ``in every color I could
find,'' Pazdernik noted. Carpenter's dressier outfits include a
Barneys black strapless satin-voile dress worn with an XOXO black
crocheted shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: A favorite outfit includes a long Amy Jean denim skirt
with suede inserts, from Traffic in the Beverly Center, combined
with an ``ethnic'' beaded halter tank from Lisa Kline, on Robertson
Boulevard, and velvet wedge flip flops from Rinaldi, also on
Robertson.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Network: HBO.

   Concept: Four single women are on the loose in New York City.
The show is in reruns now, which gives viewers a chance to relive
such thrills as the Fendi ``baguette'' bag in its many
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designers: Patricia Field and Rebecca Field (no relation
to each other).
</P>
<P>
   Clothes: The show's popularity is high, and viewers, according
to Patricia Field, have responded to a number of fashion
statements, including the gold ``name'' necklace that was made for
Sarah Jessica Parker's character, as well as a Donna Karan
``invisible-strap'' dress.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is what Patricia Field calls ``the bag of the year''
_ the Fendi baguette Parker carried for most of the season in many
incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Stores: The overall look for the show is ``hippie rock 'n' roll
couture. It could be a $5 shawl with a $400 pair of shoes _ a mix
of a whole range of things,'' Patricia Field noted, describing a
Parker outfit that mixes a leather halter top from a Patricia Field
store with an Alberta Feretti taffeta ballgown skirt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Spin City'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Network: ABC.

the color palette includes black, white, bone and red.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Anthony Minghella needs a cigarette.
Actually, he's in need of a brow-smoothing, stomach-soothing tonic
strong enough to calm the nerves of an Oscar-winning director about
to unveil his Next Big Film. But he'll settle for one of the
American Spirits he's clutching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mind?'' he asks in his soft English accent, nodding
toward the roof deck of Fantasy Films, the Berkeley, Calif., studio
where the director has spent the past five months editing ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' _ his first film since his darkly romantic
epic, ``The English Patient,'' won Oscars for Best Picture and Best
Director three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he says, padding out to the windswept roof with
its dazzling, sun-raked view of the California hills, ``but it's
the only place where they let me smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Such consternation on the part of a director who is considered
to be, after a mere three films, a major Hollywood talent might
seem laughable or even pretentious. Especially given that ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley,'' due this holiday season, is already being
touted as an Oscar contender.
</P>
<P>
   The film, half romance, half psychological thriller, is not only
blessed with Minghella at the helm, but boasts the hippest,
handsomest, most Oscar-decorated young cast going: Matt Damon,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Jude Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, several potential blessings did fall on this project,''
says Minghella, smiling, just for a moment, behind his Armani
sunglasses before his brow furrows once again. ``But as with all
blessings, there's a curse attached. And there's an expectation of
what kind of film this will be, because it's so inflected with the
casting.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Minghella says, all those Oscars _ Best Actress for
Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love''), Best Screenplay for Damon
(``Good Will Hunting'') and a Best Actress nomination for Blanchett
(``Elizabeth'') _ happened after he'd handpicked a cast of what he
considered talented character actors rather than movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Minghella, who says his own Oscar win ``changed my life in
no ways'' (he still lives in the same Hampstead home in London with
his wife, producer and choreographer Carolyn Choa, and their two
children), is feeling the pressure that befalls a bona fide
Hollywood outsider who finds himself squinting in the limelight.
Especially when you consider that at $40 million, ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' _ a co-production from Paramount and Miramax _ is
Minghella's biggest-budget film to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as nervous as it is possible to be, because I know the
audience is not going to have an easy night in the cinema,'' he
says, trying, vainly perhaps, to deflate some of the film's
pre-opening hype.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Minghella from Patricia Highsmith's 1953 suspense
novel, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is the story of a wealthy young
playboy (Law) and his equally privileged girlfriend (Paltrow), who
are befriended during a trip through Italy by Tom Ripley (Damon), a
young American who does more than just envy his friends' lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central character is not a hero in any sense of the word.
He's a man who commits murder and isn't caught,'' Minghella
cautions. ``There are no enemies. There's not even a central
protagonist-antagonist dynamic,'' he says with resignation. ``It's
really a journey into a purgatory.''
</P>
<P>
   That Minghella can spout such aphorisms without
self-consciousness reveals much about the kind of thoughtful,
philosophic observer of human nature he is. With his close-cropped
goatee, bullet-shaped head and quiet, almost monkish demeanor,
Minghella looks like the Soprano brother who ditched the mob for a
more contemplative, scholarly life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very intense,'' says Matt Damon, who became close friends
with the director during the film's 14-week shoot last year. ``He's
also the most caring man, who has the patience of Job.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the 45-year-old director, a former playwright and
university lecturer, has never been one for convention.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Italian immigrants living on the Isle of Wight,
Minghella spent the first part of his career as an academic
teaching literature at the University of Hull. That was followed by
a decade in which he was considered one of Britain's most promising
young dramatists. (His 1985 play, ``Made in Bangkok,'' remains his
best-known work.)
</P>
<P>
   When Minghella finally stepped behind the camera in 1991 to
direct his first film, ``Truly, Madly, Deeply,'' it was, he
recalls, ``the moment when I suddenly realized what I was meant to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only had he found the perfect outlet for his intensely
visual imagination, but Minghella discovered a broader canvas on
which to explore themes that had bedeviled him since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father left Italy and came to England because he saw it as
a place of bounty and opportunity,'' says the director, whose
father still works as an ice-cream seller on Wight. ``But I grew up
on an island looking at England. When I'm in England, I feel
Italian, and when I'm in Italy, I feel English _ and I always feel
like I've got my face pressed up against the glass.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of the outsider, so apparent in his plays and ``The
English Patient,'' was also what drew him to ``Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fixated on Ripley because I saw so many similarities (to
myself),'' says Minghella, who nonetheless seriously reworked
Highsmith's 1953 novel. He gave the film a strong injection of
glamour by updating the story by six years, to a time in Italy
known as Il Boom, when, Minghella explains, ``fashion began to
invade; when men were suddenly hanging around on Vespas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to imagine making this movie as if `La Dolce Vita' was
being shot on the next street,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Minghella brought an equally discriminating eye to casting. He
chose Damon to play the duplicitous Ripley, he says, ``because Matt
seems to be somebody you can trust, so your first instinct is to
root for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwyneth Paltrow, he adds, also plays against expectations as
Dickie's unsuspecting lover, who ages about 20 years throughout the
course of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right actor to play Dickie Greenleaf, the
Gatsby-esque American scion, proved more difficult. After looking
at several American actors, Minghella selected Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for someone who effortlessly summoned class, and
that is so much simpler for an English actor.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cate Blanchett, who actively lobbied for a role in the
film and who plays Meredith Logue, the young woman who falls for
Ripley, Minghella says, ``She's the kind of present you don't get
very often. She and Gywneth have that same long-limbed thoroughbred
quality, and to see these two big engines working together was
fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is very concerned with the beguiling surface and the
chaos that lurks beneath that, and so Italy is almost a
character,'' says Minghella, shaking his head at the memory of
struggling to shoot in crowded public places like Venice's Piazza
San Marco and the Spanish Steps in Rome. ``It's like what Edith
Wharton said: `Why would you be anywhere else when you can be in
Italy?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Italy can be very dark, very primitive,'' says the
director, sounding suddenly like a man concerned less with
Hollywood than with his own cultural past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole film plays that game between surface and reality.
It's about beauty with thorns.''

NEXT QUESTION UP FOR DEBATE: WHO CARES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a great old laugh line about self-absorption. The
variations are endless, but it basically goes like this: ``Oh,
please, we've talked enough about me. Let's talk about you.
(Pause.) What do you think of me?''
</P>
<P>
   And that pretty much describes the give and take among the
Republican presidential candidates in Monday night's so-called
debate on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The media blasted Thursday's debate because it didn't allow the
candidates to ask one another questions. This one did, and the
result raised a question for the rest of us: Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   The six candidates had zero interest in quizzing one another on
issues or philosophy; all they wanted to do was use the Q-and-A
segment to promote themselves or to coax an opponent into agreeing
with them on this or that policy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was so adept at this technique that he
was able to elicit praise from both the opponents whom he
questioned: Orrin Hatch and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, there was one exchange, between Bush and Gary
Bauer, that actually approached a level of discourse that might
reasonably be described as debate. Bauer got the ball rolling by
challenging Bush on his approach to U.S.-China relations. How could
America do business with China, Bauer wanted to know, in the face
of China's abysmal record on human rights?
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed with Bauer that China's treatment of its own people
and its neighbors is horrendous but said that America's best hope
of promoting change is to continue to exchange goods and ideas with
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we turn our back on China and isolate China, things
will get worse,'' Bush said. ``Imagine if the Internet took hold in
China. Imagine how freedom would spread ... our greatest export to
the world has been, is and always will be the incredible freedom we
understand in America. And that's why it's important for us to
trade with China, to encourage the growth of an entrepreneurial
class and get that ... breath of freedom in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good moment for Bauer, who believes that the United
States should take a tougher line with China, and an even better
moment for Bush, who displayed the sort of passion and spontaneity
that his critics say his campaign has lacked.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was only a moment. The entire exchange lasted
less than three minutes, and the really contentious part was over
in about 55 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to business as usual. You know: ``Mr. Opponent,
wouldn't you agree with me that I'm a really nice person and a
credit to my wonderful family?''
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose there was a time when people actually made voting
decisions on the basis of these candidate ``debates'' or ``forums''
or ``joint appearances'' _ or whatever you want to call them?
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, if we can believe the lore, John F. Kennedy turned
around the whole presidential election by handing Richard Nixon his
head in the first of a series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   But this stuff was new back then. Debates are held so early and
so often nowadays that lots of voters are inclined to tune them
out.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits and politicos keep saying that all Bush needs to do
in the debates is protect his front-runner status by holding his
own and avoiding any major gaffes. When he does that, of course,
the same people who say that he needs to hold his own and avoid
major gaffes turn around and criticize him for not doing more.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being top dog.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the debates are a waste of everybody's time and
effort because all but two of the six participants are no-chance
candidates who merely clutter up the stage and prevent the real
candidates, Bush and McCain, from effectively presenting their
views.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea. Why not dump the formal debates and let Bush and
McCain make the rounds of the chat shows _ Larry King, Sam and
Cokie, ``Meet the Press''? The candidates could kick around ideas
and issues the same way that Bush and Bauer did in their fleeting
encounter Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be any worse than what they're doing now.

 &HT;    Leftover tracks do little to enhance B.I.G.'s reputation
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, this is too easy. What we have here is an album cobbled
together of rhymes the rapper Notorious B.I.G recorded before he
was killed in March 1997. They decided not to put them on his 1994
debut, ``Ready to Die,'' or his second and last original effort,
the 1997 double album ``Life After Death.'' And it's pretty clear
why they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Um, what else is there to say? How about it's almost
disrespectful to offer this as a final album, a final portrait of a
man who became one of hip-hop's best storytellers in a few short
years. Sure, the new tracks that have been laid underneath B.I.G.'s
dated slang, cliches and sex tales are at times engaging (``Let Me
Get Down''), danceable (``Hope You (Expletive) Sleep'') and, with
the exception of the use of the lethargic sample of Prince's
``Kiss'' (``Would You Die for Me''), at least of the moment. And
this album _ full of featured guests such as his protege Lil Kim
(``Notorious B.I.G.''), Eminem (``Dead Wrong'') and Too Short on
the devilishly fun ``Big Booty (Expletive)'' _ should help fans
stay patient with this.
</P>
<P>
   But the most powerful words on this old-raps reunion come not
from this great thick-tongued lyricist, but his mother, when she
says at the end of the album: ``If I had to change anything in my
son's life that would have allowed him to be here today, I would
have deterred him from a career in music. ... If he hadn't chosen
that lifestyle, that career, my son would be alive today.''

 &HT;    Metallica clicks on collaboration
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greatest of all heavy metal rock acts, Metallica has arrived at
an unusually graceful middle age. And post-Woodstock III, the San
Francisco four-piece's stately sturm und drang seems almost
old-school: Where current metal-wise acts like Limp Bizkit and Korn
dabble in hip-hop and self-flagellation, Metallica is stridently
secure in its manliness and its method. At once head-crushing and
fearlessly soaring, the band masters defiant anthems that belong
someplace between the wrestling ring and the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   ``S&AMP;M,'' Metallica's two-CD stocking stuffer of a concept album,
implies the former and delivers the latter. Recorded live with the
San Francisco Symphony and conductor Michael Kamen, it's a ``with
strings'' adaptation of the Metallica songbook that exploits the
band's overt Wagnerian tendencies to maximum effect. What's
surprising is that it actually makes perfect sense. A Finnish
string quartet, Apocalyptica, already turned Metallica into chamber
music (as heard on the soundtrack to Neil LaButte's vicious film
comedy ``Your Friends and Neighbors''), and both the band's
gargantuan sense of wallop and the grandiose mathematics of
frontman James Hetfield's guitar solos are easily emulated or
augmented by an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   It is kind of goofy to hear ``Of Wolf and Man,'' for instance,
as lycanthropic opera. And you do wonder when the group will
release another album of new, all-original studio material. (The
last was ``Load'' in 1996.) Yet, what makes ``S&AMP;M'' compelling is
its sense of rock 'n' roll fantasy fulfilled. After all, what metal
dude hasn't wanted to ride with the Valkyries?
</P>

   Celine Dion, John Mellencamp and the programming department at
VH1, heads up: Country's Mississippi mama Faith Hill has made a
twang-free pop album so absolutely mainstream it can be piped into
the Gap. With her Wal-Mart accent bridled into mall-speak, Hill is
alternately a rocker out of the Melissa Etheridge school of
gut-wailing (``What's in It for Me''), an as-credits-roll balladeer
(``Let's Make Love,'' a duet with husband Tim McGraw) and a
big-sister singer for the teen set, a la Martina McBride (``The Way
You Love Me). No wonder ``Breathe'' debuted at No. 1 on the
Billboard 200 album chart, ahead of Mariah Carey. But if you can
forget that Hill used to be a searing country singer and accept
this as pop, it's better than average.

   You need a scorecard these days to keep up with the Latin
crossover artists populating the charts. Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony
and Enrique Iglesias have all hit the Top 10 this year and there
are sure to be more following in their footsteps. Martin has the
hip-swiveling sex appeal, Anthony the musical credentials. What
distinguishes Iglesias? Oodles of pop smarts and a dazzling,
flexible voice that pulls even the most cloying ballads from the
pit of mediocrity. He's not infallible, though. The CD's one major
misstep comes with ``Could I Have This Kiss Forever.'' A product of
the Diane Warren (``My Heart Will Go On'') dial-a-cliche
songwriting assembly line, the song finds Iglesias battling in vain
against the histrionics of duet partner Whitney Houston and the
syrupy material. Just skip directly from ``Oyeme'' to the
entertaining, if ickily titled, ``You're My 1'' and pretend for a
moment that Warren doesn't exist. ``Enrique'' and the world both
sound a whole lot better that way.

   ``Deep Blue Sea'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   People get chewed up real good in this gleefully brutal flick
about three genetically engineered supersharks and the folks they
treat like party snacks.
</P>
<P>
   In case you care, the humans include Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool
J, Saffron Burroughs and Thomas Jane. They're stuck on a sinking
research facility, but death by drowning would be preferable to
death by digestion as the huge makos get loose inside the flooded
wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Director Renny Harlin brings his usual hyper-drive direction to
the bloody action. The movie is smart enough to both honor and
break the rules of the horror genre, so you never know exactly when
the next scare will hit you. Sure, it's junk, but it'll make you
jump.

 &HT;    Sweet secrets of the doctor and diva
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take one bite of the Ambrosia Cake and hear the heavenly
Christmas angels sing. And so what if we rarely get Christmas snow?
We can make coconut-covered snowballs that taste far better than
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   We chose a few recipes from ``The Cake Mix Doctor'' (Workman
Publishing, $14.95) that will help make the holidays cheery. And
while we didn't have room to run the lengthy and detailed recipes
from Sylvia Weinstock's ``Sweet Celebrations: The Art of Decorating
Beautiful Cakes'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35), we do offer her Basic
Buttercream Icing on. We also offer a short tutorial on using gum
paste, or sugar dough, to add a little extra dazzle to your holiday
cakes.

<P>
   Assembly time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   One bite of this delight and you'll feel like you're in one of
those York peppermint patty commercials with the winter wind
whipping around you. Dress this up for the holiday table with candy
canes.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Ganache (see below)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peppermint schnapps
</P>
<P>
   Solid vegetable shortening for greasing the pans
</P>
<P>
   Flour for dusting the pans
</P>
<P>
   1 package (18.25 ounces) plain devil's food cake mix
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil, such as canola, corn, safflower, soybean
or sunflower
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1/2 recipe Peppermint Buttercream Frosting (see below)
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the Chocolate Ganache, adding the peppermint schnapps
after all the chocolate has melted. Let the ganache cool.
</P>
<P>
   Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to
350 degrees. Generously grease two 9-inch round cake pans with
solid vegetable shortening, then dust with flour. Shake out the
excess flour. Set the pans aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cake mix, cocoa powder, buttermilk, oil, eggs and
vanilla in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electric mixer on low
speed for 1 minute. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of
the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium
and beat 2 minutes more, scraping down the sides again if needed.
The batter should look thick and combined. Divide the batter
between the prepared pans, smoothing it out with the rubber
spatula. Place the pans in the oven side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cakes until they spring back when lightly pressed with
your finger and just start to pull away from the sides of the pan,
28 to 30 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and place them on
wire racks to cool for 10 minutes. Run a dinner knife around the
edge of each layer and invert each onto a rack, then invert them
again onto another rack (see photo) so that the cakes are right
side up. Cool completely, 30 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   While the cakes are baking or cooling, prepare half a recipe of
Peppermint Buttercream Frosting. When cakes are cool, place one
cake layer, right side up, on a serving platter. Spread the top
with Peppermint Buttercream Frosting. Place the second layer, right
side up, on top of the first layer and frost the top and sides of
the cake with Chocolate Ganache. Work with clean, smooth strokes.
Chill the cake until ready to serve.

   Chocolate Ganache
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 cups, enough to thinly frost a 2- or 3-layer cake
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Standing time: 10 minutes to 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   Who knew something so versatile and simple could be so divine?
You can substitute peppermint extract for the schnapps if you'd
like.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon liqueur such as Grand Marnier, framboise or
peppermint schnapps (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Place the cream in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat.
Bring to a boil, stirring, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place the
chopped chocolate in a large mixing bowl. Remove the pan from the
heat and pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate. Stir until
the chocolate is melted. Stir in the liqueur, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   To use this ganache as a glaze, let it stand at room temperature
for 10 minutes before spooning over a cooled cake. To use the
ganache as a frosting or filling, let it stand at room temperature
for 4 hours, or chill it until it thickens and is spreadable.

</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Here, we give you the full recipe of this frosting, which is
ideal for any number of holiday cakes. For instance, a full recipe
would be delightful atop a plain white cake. For Lethal Peppermint
Chocolate Cake, you'll only need half this amount (so use 4
tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 to 2
tablespoons milk and 1 tablespoon schnapps).
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely crushed peppermint candy (about 7 peppermint
sticks)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons peppermint schnapps or 1/2 teaspoon
peppermint extract
</P>
<P>
   Place the butter in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electric
mixer on low speed until fluffy, 30 seconds. Stop the machine and
add the peppermint candy, confectioners' sugar, 2 tablespoons milk
and 1 tablespoon peppermint schnapps. Blend with the mixer on low
speed until the sugar is well-incorporated, 1 minute. Increase the
speed to medium and beat until the frosting lightens and is fluffy,
1 minute more. Blend in up to 1 tablespoon milk or peppermint
schnapps if the frosting seems too stiff. Use to frost or fill the
cake of your choice.

   Anne Byrn remembers having ambrosia, a mixture of orange
sections and coconut, on the sideboard every Christmas Eve as a
child. It's that food for the gods that inspired this holiday cake.
</P>
<P>
   For the pineapple and orange filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 can (8 ounces) crushed pineapple in juice, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   Solid vegetable shortening for greasing the pans
</P>
<P>
   Flour for dusting the pans
</P>
<P>
   1 package (18.25 ounces) white cake mix with pudding
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup vegetable oil, such as canola, corn, safflower, soybean
or sunflower
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 package (6 ounces; 1 3/4 cups) frozen unsweetened grated
coconut, thawed
</P>
<P>
   Marshmallow Frosting
</P>
<P>
   For the filling: Combine the pineapple, orange juice and sugar
in a medium-size saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until the mixture is thickened, 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the filling into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate the filling so that it will cool completely, about 1
hour. Stir the filling before using it.
</P>
<P>
   Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to
350 degrees. Generously grease three 9-inch round cake pans with
solid vegetable shortening, then dust with flour. Shake out the
excess flour. Set the pans aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cake mix, water, oil and eggs in a large mixing bowl.
Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for 1 minute. Stop the
machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber
spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat 2 minutes
more, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. The batter
should look well-combined and thickened. Fold in the coconut until
it is well-distributed. Divide the batter among the prepared pans,
smoothing it out with the rubber spatula, and place them in the
oven; if your oven is not large enough, place two pans on the
center rack and the third pan in the center of the highest rack.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cakes until they spring back when lightly pressed with
your finger and just start to pull away from the sides of the pans,
18 to 20 minutes. Be careful not to overbake the layer on the
highest oven rack. Remove the pans from the oven and place them on
wire racks to cool for 10 minutes. Run a dinner knife around the
edge of the cakes and invert each onto a rack, then invert them
again onto another rack so that the cakes are right side up. Allow
them to cool completely, 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the
Marshmallow Frosting.

 &HT;    Flawless desserts and sumptuous sweets with a little help from
the Cake Diva and the Cake Doctor
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A centerpiece for the party buffet. A sweet surprise for the
carolers from church. A dazzler for the Christmas Eve feast. The
final indulgence of a millennium.
</P>
<P>
   A mere cookie won't do. Pie is a Thanksgiving has-been, and
candy is fine for the chorus line, but not for center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Let's eat cake.
</P>
<P>
   Whether fantastically decorated or merely plopped from the bundt
pan, cakes can make holiday occasions special. And in the past few
weeks, I've had occasion to make cakes with two bakers who have
decidedly different styles. But both deliver stylishly delicious
results.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Weinstock is the cake decorator for the stars, with the
cost of some of her confections reaching five figures. InStyle
Magazine referred to her as ``New York's reigning cake diva.'' Her
new cookbook, ``Sweet Celebrations: The Art of Decorating Beautiful
Cakes'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) shows why. The photos alone make
the book as worthy of the coffee table as the kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Byrn's cake art is a little more down-to-earth (and a great
deal more affordable). The former Atlanta Journal-Constitution food
editor has taken the lowly cake mix and doctored it to create
luscious desserts you'd swear were made from scratch or purchased
from a fancy bakery. Her new book is ``The Cake Mix Doctor''
(Workman Publishing, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the diva and the doctor had to share.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stories by Reagan Walker
</P>
<P>
   THE CAKE DIVA
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Weinstock has re-created everything from cathedrals to
teacups using flour, sugar, eggs and such. Her clients include
Oprah Winfrey, Whitney Houston and Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Bon Appetit called her the ``Leonardo da Vinci of wedding
cakes.'' In fact, some could put on a whole wedding for the cost of
one of her masterful confections. She's even shipped cakes as far
as Japan and Saudia Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   And she was coming to my house!
</P>
<P>
   Where there is no cake stand. No offset spatula. No pastry bags
or tips or sharp knives. And no history of cake baking, other than
the occasional chocolate layer or hummingbird cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it. We'll wing it,'' Weinstock, 69, assured
me the day before her visit.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock was in Atlanta to promote her first (and, by her
contention, last) cookbook, ``Sweet Celebrations: The Art of
Decorating Beautiful Cakes.'' So it seemed like a good idea to
invite her over for a little tutorial on jazzing up cake.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I issued the invitation before I saw the book. Before
I saw the re-creation of Alice's Tea Party, down to the crown on
the King of Heart's head. Before I saw the five-layer wedding cakes
draped in nosegays and swags of sugar-dough roses so intricate I'd
swear they were real. Before I saw a cake that looked exactly like
a potted iris.
</P>
<P>
   This book is ideal for those who like to look more than cook,
for arts-and-crafts types who'll marvel at the cake construction
and for cake hobbyists. In fact, those who've dabbled in cake
decorating will find it thrilling. There are projects you can
tackle right off and others to aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   I found it daunting, even after choosing one of the easier cakes
in the book _ a simple gift-box cake that uses a basic square shape
and some elementary decorations.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the decorations required tips and bags, cardboard
circles and something called gum paste. Not to mention dozens of
eggs, pounds of butter, cups of sugar and tubes of food coloring.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to Michaels Arts &AMP; Crafts and the grocery store got me
started. I borrowed a turntable from a co-worker. (Weinstock said
she couldn't decorate a cake without one.) Then I trekked out to
Cake Art in Stone Mountain for the 3-inch-deep square cake pans
(mine were only 2 inches deep).
</P>
<P>
   Some 75 miles and $150 later, I had assembled all the tools and
ingredients. Then the countdown began. Monday night, I made the
buttercream. Tuesday night, I made the cream cheese filling.
Wednesday night and Thursday morning, I made the cakes and gum
paste.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, I met Weinstock at a luncheon where I
witnessed pastry chefs from area restaurants gather in awe around
the diminutive grandmother (wearing her signature extra-large round
glasses) as she described how she mastered the art of re-creating
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional flowers made from icing were too thick. They
didn't look real. They weren't botanically correct,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   So she switched to sugar dough (also called gum paste), a
concoction most home cooks purchase as a dry mix. Once water is
added, it's like a ball of stiff dough, which can be rolled thin
and then shaped. ``I would go to a florist and buy a single flower,
and then re-create every detail by bending and shaping the sugar
dough,'' she said. ``The florist couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, she brought a few of those botanically correct flowers
along for our cake, so I wouldn't have to meet that test. I fell
short on a few others. When Weinstock arrived at my house at 3 p.m.
along with her husband, Ben, she immediately sized up the
situation. Two layers of my cake were still too warm to work with
and the gum paste was as hard as rock.
</P>
<P>
   So the cake hit the freezer and, after conferring with Ben, we
threw the gum paste into the microwave. Sure enough, it softened up
enough to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Ben is frequently an adviser on her cake projects. When they
married in 1949, the couple didn't even have enough money for a
wedding cake. She worked as a schoolteacher as he struggled through
law school. While raising three daughters on Long Island, they
frequently took weekend skiing trips to the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   There, once it was clear Sylvia would not ski, Ben encouraged
her to bake. So she spent many hours by the side of retired New
York chef George Keller learning about pastry. Soon, with the help
of friends in the restaurant and catering business, she established
herself as the consummate cake decorator.
</P>
<P>
   Ben, now retired, is often at her shop and is considered the
chief cake architect on tricky projects. But Weinstock knows most
home cooks who attempt to use her book probably won't have the
assistance of a husband or a staff of 15. When Ben belabored the
leveling of a cake, she snapped: ``Housewives don't have time to
make it perfect. Hurry up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thusly, we marched on, slicing each of four cakes in half,
creating eight thin layers. Then filling and stacking and icing.
All of this with dull knives and inferior tools. ``Do you have a
spatula that's attached to the handle?'' she asked after the second
time the rubber head popped off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the final result was breathtaking. And while the novice
isn't likely to re-create the flowers we topped the cake with, many
of the other decorations were quite simple _ piped from a bag with
a round tip or cut from a sheet of gum paste rolled thin, much the
way you cut cookies.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of an hour, Weinstock decorated a cake pretty as a
present, though it probably would have sold on the lower end of her
scale. Simple cakes for 30 start at $350; wedding cakes start at
$1,000. Eleven-foot confections can soar as high as $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't apologize for the cost, because intense labor and
time go into each cake. And every cake is unique. In fact, when Ted
Turner first saw his daughter's wedding cake draped in elaborate
flowers, he turned to Weinstock and asked how much it had cost him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not enough,'' Weinstock quipped. Diva la difference.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Weinstock's Basic Buttercream Icing
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 cups Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 50
minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is the classic buttercream icing Weinstock uses for many of
her cakes. It's not the kind with confectioners' sugar that you may
be used to. Here, you use egg whites, sugar and butter to create
pure silk. This is an all-purpose icing that can be colored for
decorating. You can find clear vanilla in cake-decorating and craft
stores. This amount of icing is enough for a three-tier cake.
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   13 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds (12 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature and
cut into half sticks
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons clear vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar and 3/4 cup water,
mixing with a wooden spoon until the sugar is mostly dissolved.
Place the pan on the stove, and use a clean pastry brush to paint
the area just above the water line with water. Place the pan over
medium heat. Do not stir, but watch the mixture to be sure it does
not caramelize or burn. Bring the mixture to 240 degrees on a candy
thermometer (the soft-ball stage). This should take 5 to 7 minutes.

 &HT;    Dried fruit whets appetite with sweet-tart taste
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of the year, Americans use dried fruit for snacks,
lunch box items and trail mix. But during the holiday season, the
cellophane packages of dried fruit emerge to a more prominent spot
on supermarket shelves as we begin to use them for desserts and
delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the world, however _ notably in the
</P>
<P>
   Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East and India _ dried fruit
is a culinary staple used year-round in a multitude of ways in
everyday cooking. Thousands of years ago, the Egyptians, Chinese
and a number of ancient cultures developed methods of drying foods
to preserve them for consumption well after the harvest, and the
practice spread throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   While most other foods are now preserved by canning, freezing
and other modern methods, the unique qualities of dried fruit
assured their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time to give those cellophane packets a closer
look and think about using dried fruit to enhance more than just
holiday fare. The rich, sweet-tart taste and texture of dried
fruits can marry well with beef, lamb, pork, fish and fowl and give

 &HT;    Earthquake Cake proves a favorite for holiday
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tessie Knighton of Stone Mountain, Ga., came looking
for two cake recipes. She wanted Mile-High Buttermilk Cake, with
three layers, lemon filling and fluffy frosting, all topped with
more lemon filling; and the Earthquake Cake, a kind of upside-down
German chocolate cake with a cream cheese layer she calls ``to die
for.''
</P>
<P>
   We still don't have a Mile-High recipe for Knighton but wanted
to go ahead and republish the popular Earthquake Cake while we
wait.
</P>
<P>
   Very easy to make, it's a good choice for the holidays with or
without the cola-cocoa frosting.
</P>
<P>
   California
</P>
<P>
   Earthquake Cake
</P>
<P>
   Makes 16 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: about 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   For the cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped nuts
</P>
<P>
   1 can (3.5 ounces) sweetened flaked coconut
</P>
<P>
   1 box German chocolate cake mix (prepare batter according to
package directions)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) margarine, melted
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 pound box confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the optional frosting:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons cola
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup margarine
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the bottom of the pan with the nuts and coconut. Pour
prepared cake mix batter over the nuts and coconut.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, combine melted margarine and cream cheese. If
you will not be frosting the cake, add all the confectioners'
sugar. If you will frost the cake, add 2 cups confectioners' sugar
now, reserving the remainder for the frosting. Beat until smooth.
Spoon over the batter but do not spread.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 45 minutes. You cannot test for doneness with a cake
tester, because cake will appear sticky even when it is done.
Remove from oven and cool on rack.
</P>
<P>
   Optional frosting: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine
cocoa, cola and margarine. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
Add remaining confectioners' sugar and beat with a whisk until
smooth. Spread over cooled cake.
</P>
<P>
   Per serving (without frosting): 286 calories, 2 grams protein,
17 grams fat (percent calories from fat, 54), 33 grams
carbohydrates, 16 milligrams cholesterol, 136 milligrams sodium, 1

</P>
<P>
   Per serving (with frosting): 341 calories, 2 grams protein, 23
grams fat (percent calories from fat, 61), 34 grams carbohydrates,
16 milligrams cholesterol, 214 milligrams sodium, 1 gram fiber.

<P>
   Requests
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chris Drake (e-mail) asks for two recipes. One is a cupcake
with a lemon pudding-like filling topped with confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a dark muffin she had at a church breakfast buffet.
It is ``very rich, moist and tender'' and includes sunflower seeds
and maybe molasses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cathy Brody (e-mail) lost her recipe from middle school home
economics for a snack treat confection she'd like to make again
with her children. It includes peanut butter and wheat germ.

   &QR;  Judy Ackerman of Lilburn asks for a recipe for beef stroganoff
she believes was published here in 1969. Because our online

 &HT;    Mini movie reviews
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Inspector Gadget'' (PG) _ The best gag is the first one in
Disney's big-screen version of TV's popular animated part-human,
part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman. Matthew Broderick is perfectly
cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes over the top as badman Sanford
Solex. Kids will enjoy watching them both. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The School of Flesh'' (R) _ A smart, cool-hot drama of
sexual obsession. Isabel Huppert, the grand sphinx of French
cinema, plays Dominique, a wealthy, single Parisian whose life
changes when she steps into a bar one night and locks eyes with a
hustler. It is smartly edited, trusting us to keep up with it,
never delivering a scene that feels contrived. The tone is the
epitome of French sophistication, refusing to be scandalized by
sexuality, but never underestimating its irrational power. In
French with subtitles. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Trippin''' (R) _ It keeps trippin' up on its own mixed
message. Deon Richmond plays Greg, aka ``G,'' a high school senior
whose plans for college keep getting waylaid by his fantasies of
living the phat life, surrounded by gorgeous women. The movie has
genuine flashes of charm and heart, but they're undermined by the
filmmakers' pandering to the basic instincts of its target teen
audience. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Marius and Jeannette'' (unrated) _ Not a major film but a
minor delight. A slowly evolving romance between a forty-ish single
mom (Ariane Ascaride) and a middle-aged security guard and an
endearing study of a mutually nourishing working-class
neighborhood. It's a nice place to live and an even nicer place to
visit on an easygoing afternoon at the movies. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Chinatown'' (R) _ The 13-minute clip of interviews with
director Roman Polanski, producer Robert Evans and writer Robert
Towne are just intriguing enough to make you want more talk about
this 1974 classic. It sure would have been nice to hear Jack and
Faye talking, too. That's the only real goody on the new DVD
release, and while it's not nearly enough for fans, the crisp
digital transfer of the Nicholson-Dunaway movie makes up for the
disappointment. ($14.95 VHS, $29.99 DVD). Grade: A-

   UNDATED: prepare the Marshmallow Frosting.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Place one cake layer, right side up, on a serving
platter. Spread the top of the cake layer with half of the filling,
spreading the filling with a rubber spatula up to 1 inch from the
cake edge. Place the second cake layer, right side up, on top of
the filling. Spread the second layer with the remaining half of the
filling, spreading it up to 1 inch from the cake edge. Top the two
layers with the remaining cake layer, right side up, and spread
frosting on the top and sides of the cake with clean, smooth
strokes. Garnish the cake generously with the coconut, pressing it
around the sides and top of the cake. Slice and serve.

   Snowballs
</P>
<P>
   Makes 48 snowballs
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 35 to 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Assembly time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   These magical treats are sure to satisfy kids, carolers and
elves. I bet Santa would like to have one, too, so remember to
leave one sitting out for when he visits your house.
</P>
<P>
   Solid vegetable shortening for greasing the pan
</P>
<P>
   Flour for dusting the pan
</P>
<P>
   1 package (18.25 ounces) plain white cake mix
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil, such as canola, corn, safflower, soybean
or sunflower
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 recipes Marshmallow Frosting (see above)
</P>
<P>
   1 package (12 ounces; 3 cups) frozen unsweetened grated coconut,
thawed
</P>
<P>
   Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to
350 degrees. Generously grease a 13-by-9 inch baking pan with solid
vegetable shortening, then dust with flour. Shake out the excess
flour. Set the pan aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cake mix, sour cream, oil, eggs and vanilla in a large
mixing bowl. Blend with an electric mixer on low speed for 1
minute. Stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl with
a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat 2
minutes more, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. The
batter should look well-combined and thickened. Pour the batter
into the prepared pan, smoothing it out with the rubber spatula.
Place the pan in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cake until it is lightly browned and springs back when
lightly pressed with your finger, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove the pan
from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes.
Run a dinner knife around the edge of the cake and invert it onto a
rack, then invert it again onto another rack so that the cake is
right side up. Allow it to cool completely, 30 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prepare two recipes of Marshmallow Frosting, using a
large saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Place the coconut in a shallow pan. Cut the cake
into 48 squares, about 1 1/2 inches each, making 8 slices down the
long side of the pan and 6 slices across. Remove the squares and
spread each on all sides with some of the Marshmallow Frosting.
Roll each frosted square in cococut. Place the snowballs, as you
finish them, in a single layer on large serving platters or in a
single layer in plastic storage boxes. Continue the process until
all the snowballs have been assembled. Cover the platters with wax
paper or place the lids on the storage boxes. Place the snowballs
in the refrigerator to chill until firm, about 30 minutes. Serve at
once or keep refrigerated until serving time.

</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 5 minutes

</P>
<P>
   1 jar (7 ounces; 1 1/2 cups) marshmallow creme
</P>
<P>
   Place sugar, water and egg whites in a medium-size heavy
saucepan. Cook over low heat, beating continuously with an electric
hand mixer on high speed until soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. If
mixer has a cord, make sure to keep it away from the burner. Remove
pan from heat. Add marshmallow creme and beat mixture with mixer on
high speed until stiff peaks form, 2 minutes more. Use at once to
frost the cake of your choice.

   Flour for dusting the pan
</P>
<P>
   1 package (18.25 ounces) plain yellow cake mix
</P>
<P>
   1 package (5.1 ounces) vanilla instant pudding mix
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup amaretto
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil, such as canola, corn, safflower, soybean
or sunflower
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract, optional
</P>
<P>
   For the glaze and garnish:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners' sugar, sifted
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 tablespoons amaretto
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to
350 degrees. Lightly mist a 10-inch tube pan with vegetable oil
spray, then dust with flour. Shake out the excess flour. Set the
pan aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cake mix, pudding mix, amaretto, water, oil, eggs and
almond extract in a large mixing bowl. Blend with an electic mixer
on low speed for 1 minute. Stop the machine and scrape down the
sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Increase the mixer speed
to medium and beat for 2 minutes more, scraping the sides down
again if needed. The batter should look thick and smooth. Pour the
batter into the prepared pan, smoothing it out with the rubber
spatula. Place the pan in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cake until it is golden brown and springs back when
lightly pressed with your finger, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove the pan
from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool for 20 minutes.
Run a long, sharp knife around the edge of the cake and invert it
onto a rack and then again onto a serving platter so that it is
right side up.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the glaze: Place the confectioners' sugar and amaretto
in a small mixing bowl and stir until well-combined. Spoon the
glaze over the top of the warm cake, allowing it to drizzle down
the sides. Scatter the toasted almonds over the top to garnish.
Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing.

   More advice from authors
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in cakes, there are a number of new books
on the market beyond Sylvia Weinstock's and Anne Byrn's. Here are a
few to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Title: ``James McNair's Cakes''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Author: James McNair
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Publisher and price: Chronicle Books, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Number of recipes: 42
</P>
<P>
   James McNair is the master of single-subject cookbooks. In his
26th, he offers up recipes for familiar favorites, like basic
poundcake, yellow cake and white cake. But he also offers more
inventive fare, like Bananas Foster Cake, Passion Fruit Cake and
Molten Chocolate Babycakes. The Three-Milk Cake looks absolutely
divine. Most recipes hold to a page.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Title: ``Betty Crocker's New Cake Decorating''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Author: Home economists of Betty Crocker
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Publisher and price: Macmillan, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Number of recipes: 93
</P>
<P>
   Need a cake that looks like a bicycle? How about one that looks
like a burger? Or, in honor of our city's favorite newcomers, how
about a panda cake? This new Betty Crocker is the answer. It has a
number of inventive cakes created largely from cutting and shaping
cakes baked in basic 9-inch round or 13-by-9-inch rectangular
baking pans. Great to have on hand for birthdays and holidays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Title: ``The Art of the Cake: Modern French Baking and
Decorating''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Authors: Bruce Healy and Paul Bugat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Publisher and price: William Morrow, $35
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Number of recipes: More than 100
</P>
<P>
   No silly animal shapes here. This is a book for those interested
in more sophisticated, European-style cakes. There is fairly
detailed guidance for creating French pastries, including hundreds
of step-by-step line drawings. For the holidays, the lemon meringue
yule log might be festive. The Alhambra, a chocolate-hazelnut
sponge cake, looks divine.

   UNDATED: take 5 to 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As the sugar nears the required temperature, place the egg
whites in the large bowl of an electric mixer. Beat the egg whites
at medium speed until they turn from opaque to white and begin to
hold soft peaks. They should be at least double in volume in about
3 to 5 minutes. Do not overbeat.
</P>
<P>
   When the sugar is ready, turn the mixer on high and very slowly
and carefully pour the hot sugar mixture into the egg whites. Pour
in a very thin stream near the edge of the bowl. Beat for 20 to 35
minutes on medium to high speed. The egg whites will lose some of
their volume and the mixture should resemble a very thick meringue.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, reduce the speed to medium or low and add the
room-temperature butter pieces, one at a time. The mixture will
break and begin to look like cottage cheese, but don't worry. Keep
the mixer running, continue adding butter and let the mixer whip
the buttercream until it begins to get smooth again. This could
take up to 10 minutes. Once the mixture is smooth, add the vanilla
and beat for 5 minutes more. Chill until ready to use, or freeze.

<P>
   The magic of gum paste
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful tips I picked up from my time with Sylvia
Weinstock was the use of sugar dough, also called gum paste, for
decorating. It's wonderfully pliable (and edible) dough that can be
cut or shaped in almost any manner. Beginners may simply want to
work with cookie cutters.
</P>
<P>
   I found the dry mix at Michaels Arts &AMP; Crafts. You simply mix it
with water, though the Wilton mix I used should have called for
more water to make the dough soft and pliable. Once you have a soft
ball to work with, tear off a chunk, add food coloring and work it
in until the color is even. Then roll the mixture out thinly like a
pie crust. Here, Weinstock shows how to form a ribbon. Again, basic
shapes and cookie cutters are a great place for beginners to start.
Simply cut out and then apply to the cake where desired. Weinstock
includes step-by-step instructions for creating several different
flowers and ribbons in her book.
</P>
<P>
   The Cake Doctor
</P>
<P>
   Anne Byrn was a cake-mix snob. You know the kind. They would
never dare to allow Duncan, Betty or the Doughboy near their cake
pans.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom in her 20 years of food writing did Byrn tear off the top
of a box mix. She was a purist, baking cakes from scratch _ even if
it took hours and even if the results weren't always consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing when it doesn't turn out right or when
it's dry within a day,'' said Byrn, whose career includes a stint
as food editor for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's an admission Byrn can make freely now that she
is a reformed cake-mix snob. In fact, she's the author and namesake
of a new cookbook, ``The Cake Mix Doctor'' (Workman Publishing,
$14.95).
</P>
<P>
   The reformation came a couple of years ago, when Byrn wrote a
column for The Tennessean, the daily newspaper in Nashville, where
she now lives. She shared with readers tips and recipes from her
friends and family on how to doctor up cake mixes. Then, she asked
readers to share theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, she had mail bins full of letters, some 500
addressed to the Cake Mix Doctor. Byrn began testing and tasting
the concoctions of creative home cooks, and soon she had more than
150 recipes and a cookbook was born _ one so popular it went into a
third printing in the first month of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a book for Middle America. You know, the folks who
appreciate good food and cooking, but who don't always have a half
day to bake a cake,'' said Byrn, 43-year-old mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   To prove her point, she recently baked, frosted and adorned a
Lethal Peppermint Chocolate Cake in my kitchen. It was pretty
enough for the Christmas table, and it took only about two hours
start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   We started with a simple ganache. Byrn includes a nice explainer
in the book on the irresistible chocolate sauce made of chopped
semisweet chocolate and hot whipping cream. The proportions change
depending on whether you want a sauce, frosting or truffles. We
added a little peppermint schnapps for flavor.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 5 minutes to mix, but then ganache needs to sit at
room temperature for several hours. We took a shortcut and put it
in the fridge _ a decision we'd pay for later.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the cake. Cake mixes are convenient because you can simply
dump all the ingredients in the bowl, mix and pour. With scratch
cakes, there's a certain order to the blending of ingredients and
the mixing time is usually longer.
</P>
<P>
   Byrn started by whisking the devil's food cake mix in a bowl to
eliminate any lumps. Then she added 3 tablespoons cocoa. ``Adding
cocoa will add a lot of depth to the cake. The only thing you have
to be careful of is, it will make the cake drier, so don't
overcook,'' said Byrn.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Byrn added buttermilk, one of her favorite doctoring
ingredients. ``It marries beautifully with chocolate. It adds
moisture without a lot of fat, and the acidity brings out the
flavor,'' she said. After that, the standard eggs, vegetable oil
and vanilla extract were stirred in. Total mixing time was only 3
to 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the cake baked, we whipped up the Peppermint Buttercream
Frosting. Again, it's an easy mixture of powdered sugar, butter,
milk and, for this variety, crushed peppermint candy. The
preparation took 10 minutes, leaving us plenty of time for a chat
while soap operas murmured on the kitchen television.
</P>
<P>
   When the cakes were done and had rested in their pans for 10
minutes, Byrn flipped them out onto a rack, and then flipped them
again to preserve their dome-shaped tops. ``I think the dome tops
are what give a cake that homemade look,'' she said. No leveling
with a knife for her.
</P>
<P>
   While the cakes cooled, we checked in on our ganache, only to
discover we had allowed it to become too cold and stiff. It was
hard to manage. No matter. There was a doctor in the house. Byrn
quickly heated up a few tablespoons of cream and blended it in to
soften the spread.
</P>
<P>
   She put the first layer on a cake stand and smeared it with a
thick blanket of the Peppermint Buttercream Frosting, stopping just
before the edges of the cake. The top layer went on, and then the
ganache was smoothed over the entire cake. For that extra Christmas
touch, we dusted the top with crushed peppermint and added a few
miniature candy canes to the sides. Some holly sprigs on the cake
stand were the final touch.
</P>
<P>
   We took a moment to admire the work and snap a few photos. Then
we cut a hunk out, grabbed our forks and dug in. Scrumptious.
</P>
<P>
   Even a cake-mix snob would agree.

AEROSMITH'S ROCKIN RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Scranton and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Can it be? Is that actually Aerosmith greeting you before the
start of a Walt Disney World ride called the Rock 'n' Roller
Coaster Starring Aerosmith?
</P>
<P>
   No. But you may be forgiven if you thought the Boston rockers
were actually present: What you're seeing is a holographic movie.
And that's just the first surprise at this Disney-MGM Studios
attraction. When you ride the coaster, here's what happens:
</P>
<P>
   --You travel on a track that is 3,043 feet long _ more than a
half-mile of twists, turns, loops, corkscrews, hills, and dips. The
ride is Disney's first coaster in the United States that features
inversions.
</P>
<P>
   --The high-speed launch catapults each 24-person car, or
Limotrain, to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds. That's similar to the
feeling you'd get in a supersonic jet as it blasts off from the
deck of an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   --You encounter a force of nearly 5 Gs in the transition from
launch to loop in the ride's first inversion. In contrast, space
shuttle astronauts encounter only 3 Gs at liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   --Each Limotrain has 120 speakers, and each plays a different,
specially recorded Aerosmith song (for instance, ``Love in an
Elevator'' has been transformed into ``Love in a Roller Coaster'').
In all, the attraction has 900 speakers and
</P>
<P>
   more than 32,000 watts of audio amplifier output power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And, oh yes, this speedy, sonic ride all happens indoors . . .
and in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Disney: ``Mousetales, the Unofficial Newsletter of
Walt Disney World'' is offering 10 tips for visiting the Year 2000
celebration at Epcot. The tips include the best time to visit
Millennium Village (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.), the best places to view the
Tapestry of Nations Parade (the Germany or Italy areas of World
Showcase) and Illuminations 2000 (the bridges between the United
Kingdom and France), and where to snag three free souvenirs (the
Innovations buildings). For a free copy, send a self-addressed,
stamped envelope to Mousetales, PO Box 383, Columbus, OH 43216.

$12.95; for a single issue, send $4.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: What is Mexico's largest lake? (Answer at end of
column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a name: Many assume Angel Falls in Venezuela got its name
because of its heavenly height. (At 3,212 feet, it is the world's
highest waterfall.) But the real reason is because it was
discovered by Jimmy Angel, a pilot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Wonderful, wonderful, sublime, indescribable,
incomprehensible; I never saw anything so truly and appallingly
grand.'' _ P.T. Barnum, after his first visit to California. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bus drivers' joke (Santa Fe): A tour-bus driver calls over to
another tour-bus driver parked nearby: ``Hey, I see they finally
gave you your license back!'' The second driver replies, ``Right.
And how did your eye surgery go?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Texas requires a permit for people to go
barefoot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Getting around: In San Juan, 40 policemen have donned in-line
roller skates to patrol tourist areas and shopping centers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mailbag: Jeff Coyne of Roslindale begs to differ with our statement
that Lhasa, Tibet, is the world's highest capital. Citing the
Encyclopedia of World Geography, he writes: ``LaPaz, the capital of
Bolivia, is 13,461 feet above sea level. This tops Lhasa by 1,374
feet.'' Merriam Webster's Geographical Dictionary agrees that LaPaz
is the highest capital, but puts its altitude at 12,001 feet,
topping Lhasa by just 171 feet. Other sources offer still different
figures but put LaPaz on top. So Jeff is right. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Lake Chapala in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. The
651-square-mile lake is 50 miles long. &QL;

SCANNO: DIZZYING DELIGHT AT 3,500 FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Scranton and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCANNO, Italy _ The village is a cliffhanger, all right, long in
the tooth and stuck against a molar in the snow belt of Abruzzo.
Scanno poses an adventure in walking tilting, cobbled streets,
wondering if you'll get out of town the fastest way _ falling head
over heels into the lovely Sagittario River valley 3,500 feet
below.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe that's a slight exaggeration. Gravity hasn't claimed
anybody lately, says Gabriela DiMasso, innkeeper at her modest yet
immaculate Albergo Centrale.
</P>
<P>
   But, like so many towns in these mountains, the central
Apennines, Scanno seems to be clinging dangerously by its
collective thumbs. However, the packed stacks of graying stone and
tile _ a huddle of homes, churches, small palaces, and shops _ have
hung and clung together like a crowd of fall-proof goats at least
since the Middle Ages. Signora DiMasso sees no reason why they
shouldn't stick it out together for another millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The women of the community also hang on _ onto a sartorial style
that goes back centuries with Asia Minor origins. Shod in black
slippers, garbed in long black dresses and aprons, topped by black
turbanesque head wrappings, they might be showing off a folk
costume for a local pageant. You feel as though you've stumbled
into such a performance, or possibly even tumbled back into another
age. However, it's not a costume worn as an amusement for tourists
in a village that time forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just part of our culture. Not changing much,'' says
Signora DiMasso, who doesn't favor the fashion herself, and isn't
dressed as somberly as the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she answers a question, ``it isn't limited to widows or
women in mourning. Just a custom. Tradition. We have television and
roads, modern ski lifts now, but maybe people who lived by
themselves in the mountains for so long are slower to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazarreno Ricci, the ebullient proprietor of Serenissima, a
trattoria to salivate for in Rome (a couple of blocks from the
Cavalieri Hilton), frequently has urged us to look into Abruzzo,
his native turf. Of course, every Italian you meet boosts the
grounds where he stomps, or did stomp as a youth _ and is usually
justified.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Publius Ovidius Naso (the poet Ovid)
enthusiastically applauded his own birthplace a few years before
the birth of Christ: ``Sulmo mihi patria est!'' (``Sulmona is my
fatherland!'') Eventually the initials, SMPE, of the famous local
boy's tribute were incorporated in his hometown's emblem.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast about 100 miles from Rome, and on the way to Scanno,
Sulmona is a pleasingly unhurried valley city of 25,000, embraced
by remaining sections of its medieval wall and some of the gates.
</P>
<P>
   It nurtured a couple of yet highly regarded romantic items.
First, arriving in 43 BC, was Ovid, whose ``Art of Love'' and other
amusing poetry devoted to commingling of the sexes, is still read.
Later came a product, the confection called ``confetti'':
sugar-covered almonds that are considered good luck and appear on
wedding tables as favors.
</P>
<P>
   Inspecting several confetterias and buying up a variety of them
in the shapes and colors of flowers, my friend Aurelio said,
``These local candy-makers are artists. They've gone well beyond
the originals, the sugar-coated almonds in pastels that we call
Jordan almonds in the US. Don't you remember seeing them as favors
at Italian weddings at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Very good weddings since I remember nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Ovid, who used to make fun of marriage. His wit got him
into big trouble. It is unknown whom he offended or why, but Ovid,
a star in Rome among the crowd of Emperor Augustus, was run out of
town by imperial decree. Augustus exiled him to the chilling,
barbaric wilds of what is now Romania where, despite pleas for
clemency, he spent the rest of his days, nine years, forlorn and
lonely _ but still writing.
</P>
<P>
   How did he live? David Maloof, the Australian writer, conjures
it up in a fine novel, ``An Imagined Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovid's stuff has lasted, and a few of his lines may have
influenced people such as Bill Clinton: ``You who seek an end of
love, love yields to business: be busy and be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``You will go most safely in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the one that applies to most of us: ``I see and
approve better things, but follow worse.''
</P>
<P>
   There are worse roads to follow than the gorge-flirting pavement
that creeps through a beautiful stretch of the Apennines, the spine
of Italy from top to bottom: Alps to Sicily. Diving through tunnels
and bridging gaps, to reach Scanno, it is a challenging route with
enough curls to make a snake nauseous. Or envious.
</P>
<P>
   Snow is coming, though some of it has never departed the creamy,
cloud-pinned crests that jut all about. Lake Scanno, an aqua-tinted
bowl, will stiffen with ice. The ski hotels on the outskirts are
getting ready for the season, but Scanno is still quiet. Beside the
tall bell tower of Santa Maria della Valle, a church with parts
belonging to the 12th century, old men sit on old benches and gaze
into the hazy valley, perhaps reminiscing about the good old days
of the wool-trade boom of the 16th century. Probably none of them
is enrolled in the computer course advertised in a shop window.
</P>
<P>
   Our landlady recommends Alle Fonte, the Tarullo brothers'
restaurant, for dinner. ``Massimo, Nuncio, and Orazio will take
good care of you.'' They do, in an attractive pine-paneled room
where the three of us are the only diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it gets busier,'' says Massimo, also a carpenter, ``when
the ski season begins, and later, summer.'' The homemade gnocchi
with a tomato sauce is especially good.
</P>
<P>
   As a finishing touch, Massimo brings Amaro with fresh-baked
cookies, saying, ``You should come back in January for the Festa of
St. Antonio Abate. We cook a giant lasagna outside, beside Santa
Maria della Valle, and everyone is free to eat all they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like dreaded lasagna overload to me, but interesting. I
mean, what journalist ever turned down a free meal?
</P>
<P>
   After dinner we walk the compressed, dark, empty streets of
``this lop-sided place, a pedestrian roller coaster,'' in the words
of compatriate Ron Sampson. ``I hope the politicians are on the
level because nothing else is in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   The moon dips and ascends as we also do on steep staircases that
pass for thoroughfares and passageways leading . . . where?
</P>
<P>
   TVs babble behind shuttered windows, a card game is glimpsed
through a cafe window. Two old women, only yards apart, converse in
raspy whispers from facing iron balconies. Laundry hangs hopeful of
sunshine and breeze tomorrow. Puncturing the stillness, cats warble
and dogs croon. Our footsteps on paving stones are percussion
completing the ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Sloping ramps, leaning alleys, rising and plunging arteries give
us passing grades as we wander, wondering what it's like when snow
and ice appear. ``A slalom on foot? Tricky,'' says Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people are roped together like mountain climbers,''
Aurelio speculates.
</P>
<P>
   I've fallen out of trees, love, sorts, favor, and beds _ but
never a town.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio takes my hand, reassuringly, ``I won't let it happen.
After all, you've got the credit cards and the room key.''

IN LONDON, THE ART OF TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Scranton and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``You're not as brainy as you think you are,'' shouts
the man standing on the stepladder. ``There's a lot you don't
know.'' (Is he reading my wife's mind?) ``For example, how many
leaves are there on that tree?''
</P>
<P>
   With a brisk fall breeze altering the count by the second, this
is a question too tough for me, so I drag Marcia along to the next
soapbox orator holding forth at Speakers' Corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe your grandmommy was a big fish?'' he demands.
Now, this is a query I can answer. I saw self-same grandmommy just
a month or so ago, and though she grew up swimming in the St.
Lawrence River, she's most definitely a land-based biped.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia is more interested in the youngish guy from the
Association of World Federalists who has drawn a crowd of several
dozen with his dire warning that the oceans are rising and tropical
diseases spreading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is responsible for dealing with this kind of stuff?'' he
demands. ``Nice Mr. Blair with his wavy hands?'' His own flutter
through the air in imitation. ``No, there is no authority in the
world to deal with global problems.''
</P>
<P>
   No, indeed. But as long as there's a Speakers' Corner, there
will be someone to talk about them. Since Parliament's 1872 law
making it legal to declaim on any topic, the northeast corner of
Hyde Park, just a few yards from the Marble Arch Underground stop,
has been the favored place for Sunday speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and politics are always on the agenda, but it's not
just the fire and brimstone crowd warning about eternal damnation
or moldy Marxists yammering about the proletariat. During England's
great beer debate of the mid-1980s, for example, you could
regularly hear purists pouring forth on the virtues of freehouses
and real ale. And it's not just oratory, but a give-and-take where
interaction with the audience is part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is legitimate objection, but most is just (usually)
good-natured heckling. One day a half decade ago I watched a
hirsute street preacher hold forth on the promise of heaven, only
to be interrupted by a cockney skeptic with a pressing question.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'yeh 'alf to 'ave a long beard to be a 'oly man?'' he
inquired. ``Eh've always wanted to be a 'oly man, but I just can't
grow a long beard.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day in early November, there's some of the
same spirit abroad at the corner. A few yards on, a 35-ish
professional type holds forth about _ I kid you not _ the need to
change the accounting system, particularly the depreciation of
assets, to give investors a more level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get to a real economic rate-of-return measure, we
can better understand prices,'' he promises. ``Then we can identify
promising firms and we can add real value, not only for ourselves
but for our investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you against money?'' shouts a bystander, evidently reading
into the recondite call for more legible ledgers a more Marxist
condemnation of capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' replies the orator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then shut up and give me yours,'' returns his criticaster,
still missing the point, but delighted with his own wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, a man who disdains money is a pauper,'' answers the
speaker, casting a suggestive glance at his unkempt questioner.
</P>
<P>
   And without missing a beat, he's back on the subject of more
accurate accounting.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   London is a city of marvelous museums, but oddly, because the
National Gallery and the Tate are so dazzling, the city's smaller
jewels are often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   One that definitely is, is Sir John Soane's Museum, in Lincoln's
Inn Field, just a few blocks from the Holborn Underground stop.
</P>
<P>
   Soane (1753-1837) was an architect by trade, a collector (and
something of a pack rat) by avocation. His home is a treat not
simply because of the opportunity it offers to tour a stately
English townhouse set in one of London's most interesting
residential squares. Or because it's free.
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is the work by William Hogarth, England's first
truly great painter. Hogarth was, among other things, a satirist,
and the two series of paintings on display here _ ``The Rake's
Progress'' and ``An Election'' _ hilariously trace corruption both
spiritual and electoral.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, the viewer sees Tom Rakewell, a young Oxford
student, inherit a fortune from his miserly father, forsake his
pregnant fiancee, and order a suit of clothes to inaugurate his
career as spendthrift and roue.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent canvases chronicle Tom through the accumulation of
parasitic hangers-on; an orgy at the infamous Rose Tavern, where a
harlot lifts his watch while otherwise distracting him; his arrest
for debt as he makes his way to royal court; his marriage to an
elderly one-eyed dowager to redeem his fortunes; a further descent
into gambling, debauchery, debt, and, ultimately, prison; and,
finally, his death in the Bedlam madhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are rich with witty detail, and puzzling out the
pictorial story, with the help of a museum pamphlet, is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Just as rewarding, if a bit more difficult to decipher, is ``An
Election,'' a four-painting series that chronicles the liquor,
bribes, and blandishments with which the Whigs and the Tories
pursued votes in the election in 1854, through to the corrupt and
riotous victory celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The two series alone make this museum worth a trip, but they are
far from its only attractions. And the opportunity, afterward, to
tour the nearby law courts adds to the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 10-minute walk toward the Thames brings you to the Courtauld
Gallery at Somerset House, Strand, which one critic has called the
best small museum in the world. And with good reason. This gallery
of 530 paintings contains an expansive collection of Peter Paul
Rubens and a broad range of Impressionism and post-Impressionism
works, including paintings by Cezanne, Degas, Gauguin, Modigliani,
Monet, Manet, Pissarro, Renoir, Seurat, Sisley, and van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you have an afternoon or an hour you can spend it
profitably here. Yet in the various times I've been, I've never
seen more than perhaps 20 people browsing through the several
floors of its collection. That's puzzling, since the Courtauld's is
hardly a collection of lesser-known works. Indeed, the museum
boasts several of the world's best-known paintings.
</P>
<P>
   One is Edouard Manet's masterpiece, ``A Bar at the
Folies-Bergere,'' in which a wistful barmaid stares diffidently
back at a customer whose own intent look, reflected back at us from
a mirror behind her, suggests it may be her rather than a drink
he's interested in buying _ even as the angle of reflection seems
to put the viewer in the position of the man who has elicited her
melancholic gaze.
</P>
<P>
   A second is a work most everyone knows, van Gogh's
``Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear,'' painted in Arles after his
quarrel with Gauguin about aesthetic inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   If Manet caught a certain melancholy plaintiveness in ``A Bar at
the Folies-Bergere,'' Renoir freezes romantic disillusionment in
``The Theatre Box,'' in which a beautiful woman in pearls and
decollete stares pensively out at us while her escort, behind her,
scans the other boxes with his opera glasses. The expression on her
face suggests she knows he's looking at other women _ and that long
years have resigned her to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Courtauld also has two famous nudes. One is Modigliani's
captivatingly erotic ``Nude,'' a work whose inclusion of pubic hair
so scandalized the Paris police when it was first shown in 1917
that they ordered the entire exhibit closed.
</P>
<P>
   A second is a smaller version of Manet's ``Le Dejeuner sur
l'herbe'' (``Luncheon on the Grass''), which hangs in Paris's Musee
d'Orsay. This painting shows two women, one naked, with two dressed
men. And no idealized nymph or Venus is she, cloaking her nudity in
the acceptable antiquity of classical illusion. With the painting
set in the everyday France of 1863, her nakedness, and the bold,
defiant way she returns the viewer's gaze _ suggesting prostitution
or at least libertinism _ set critics ahowl.
</P>
<P>
   And if you favor blues and greens over that blasted ochre that
dominates so much of Cezanne's palette, you just may declare his
rendering of the ``Lake at Annecy,'' in the French foothills of the
Alps, the most pleasing painting Cezanne ever produced.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace Collection, in Hertford House in Manchester Square
(just a short walk from the Bond Street tube stop), is another
formerly private collection housed in the home of its onetime
owner, Sir Richard Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is both an art museum and a showcase for decorative arts,
including one of the world's finest collections of porcelain and
rooms of armor, which means the ornate mansion really does have
something for most everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But the cornerstone of its collection is the paintings, which
include works by Titian, Poussin, Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens,
Velazquez, and Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallace Collection is free, so it's worth a trip even if the
17th and 18th centuries aren't necessarily your first love in art.
In a 15-minute tour of the main gallery you can see the
collection's masterpieces, including Titian's ``Perseus and
Andromeda,'' Nicolas Poussin's ``A Dance to the Music of Time,''
Rembrandt's ``Titus,'' a portrait of his son at 16, and the work
the museum is best-known for, Frans Hals's ``The Laughing
Cavalier.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria and Albert Museum, with its huge collection of
decorative, fine and applied art, hardly ranks as either a small
museum or one that's often overlooked. Just yards from the South
Kensington Underground stop, it's a massive museum that boasts more
than seven miles of rooms, and any normal visitor will find himself
suffering from museum overload, that mysterious malady that can
only be treated by repairing to the nearest pub to dose oneself
with a pint of lager, before he's seen a fraction of the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is one little-known aspect of the V &AMP; A: the Print
Room in the Henry Cole Wing. This is where the museum keeps its
off-display collection of more than half a million watercolors,
engravings, etchings, and the like. It's really a research room for
art scholars, yet if you wash your hands and put away your pens,
sit up straight, and speak quietly, the curators will bring you
portfolios of work from any of scores of artists.
</P>
<P>
   On our visit, we requested Joseph Mallord William Turner's
watercolors. Ten minutes later, a curator had delivered to us a box
of 18 paintings, and we sat there reverential as Ruskin admiring
Turner's genius. No, we didn't know how many leaves were left upon
the tree in Speakers' Corner, but we felt brainy indeed for making
our latest London discovery.

TREASURES OF QUEENSLAND: REEF AND RAIN FOREST

 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITSUNDAY, Australia _ Barry and I had becomes fast friends,
swimming alongside each other off Hayman Island, a paradise of a
place on the Great Barrier Reef. But now it was time for lunch, so
I clambered back aboard the boat . . . and threw Barry a hunk of
bread, which was quickly engulfed by his big blue lips.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, you see, is a fish _ a giant Maori wrasse, to be precise.
He's about 3 feet long and has a handsome hump that he didn't mind
letting me pat. Barry (as in Barrier) is a familiar figure off the
island as he greets snorkelers and swims around with hundreds of
his smaller friends _ just a sampling of the 1,500 species of fish
found in the 1,250-mile-long Great Barrier Reef, stretching along
the continent's northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The reef, with its fish and coral and islands and waters in
several shades of green, is a treasure. But then again so is the
Wet Tropics rain forest, which brings you the world as it was
millions of years ago. The rain forest area stretches from about
125 miles north of Cairns, the biggest city in the area, to some
185 miles south. Together, the reef and the rain forest make up
nature's dynamic duo in Tropical North Queensland. Both are World
Heritage Sites and neither should be missed. Fortunately both are
easy to visit without the need to rough it, because the area has no
shortage of stylish resorts and fine restaurants along with a
plethora of knowledgeable guides and transportation that can be a
treat in itself. The tropical north is home to 600 tours from
Cairns alone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Great Barrier Reef &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting Barry and other finny fellows, I was awed
just seeing the reef, with its 300 kinds of living, breathing,
sometimes waving coral, some hard, others soft and frondlike, and
still others looking a lot like big brains. (Despite their
appearance, they are animals, not plants. They have cells that
catch prey and openings for material to move in and out.) Add to
that 4,000 kinds of mollusk, 400 species of sponge, anemone,
crustaceans, and echinoderms, as well as 500 kinds of seaweed, six
species of turtles, thousands of birds, and the last great
population of those curious aquatic mammals called dugong.
</P>
<P>
   Whales come to the warm waters around the reef to give birth,
and are best viewed from July to October. What's more, there are
600 continental islands and 300 cays, or reef islands, many of them
emerald-colored and fringed with sandy beaches. You'll never see
all that the reef _ actually a complex of more than 2,900 reefs _
has to offer. But it's fun to view as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   You don't even have to get wet, thanks to helicopter flyovers
and rides in semisubmersible, glass-bottomed vessels. (One of those
boats is a yellow ``submarine'' near a tiny island named Bali Hai.)
My first view of the reef involved a copter flight from Hamilton
Island and a Fantasea cruise in a high-speed catamaran, complete
with a buffet lunch and lots of beverages.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing like getting in the water to view the
multicolored fish up close. Boat tours make snorkeling equipment
available (and if I can snorkel, getting just a wee bit of the
Pacific Ocean up my nose, it must be easy), and there are charters
for certified scuba divers. There is such peace in floating amid
the fish and the coral that I was eager to repeat the experience a
few days later on a day sail from magical Hayman Island. Good thing
I did or I never would have met my friend Barry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The rain forest &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Australia's rain forests transports you back millions
of years to when Australia was part of a supercontinent called
Gondwana. Plant lovers will rejoice in the diverse kinds that grow
in this forest, where more than half of the annual 13 feet of
rainfall is caught by the plants before it reaches the ground. A
canopy of leaves filters the bright tropical sunlight, leaving the
forest floor dark and cool.
</P>
<P>
   And animal lovers, if they are fortunate, have a chance to see
58 frog species, 100 mammal, 327 bird, 162 reptile, 64 native fish,
and more than 40,000 insect species. (You wouldn't want to see all
of the insects at once, certainly.) The creatures, of course, don't
come out to greet you, so you may want to visit a place like the
Rainforest Habitat Wildlife Sanctuary in Port Douglas, where for a
few dollars admission you are assured of seeing bats, crocodiles,
marsupials, and cassowaries _ more than 150 species in all, most of
which roam freely and many of which can be viewed from walkways.
For an extra donation, you even get to pat or photograph a
eucalyptus-munching koala.
</P>
<P>
   In the Port Douglas area, a guide from Australian Wilderness
Safaris showed off a swatch of the Daintree rain forest area, with
its cool waters, prehistoric ferns, and sunlight softened by the
canopies of leaves. And in Cairns, a ride on the Skyrail, a
4.7-mile cableway, brought memorable views of forest and waterfall,
with exploratory stops along the way and a lively village called
Kuranda at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate travelers, though, take their Skyrail ride at the
beginning or end of a trip on the Great South Pacific Express,
Australia's glistening answer to the Venice-Simplon Orient Express
(they're part of the same company). The Great South Pacific Express
goes through the forest, right past the waterfalls, past great
farms and fields where kangaroos and cattle can be spotted, and
near small towns that look like stage sets of the 1800s' American
West. A day at the Great Barrier Reef is also part of this luxury
train trip.
</P>
<P>
   The twin treasures of reef and rain forest can fill many a day,
and yet that's hardly all the untamed nature that Queensland _ and
not only its tropical north _ offers. Queenland, the second-largest
Australian state (it's 2 1/2 times the size of Texas), has 400
natural and environmental parks, the world's tallest vegetated sand
hills, the nation's densest jungles, and its driest desserts. There
are many beautiful beaches, too, although from approximately
November through May, swimming is restricted to netted areas. The
reason is box jellyfish, which you don't want to mess with. (``How
do you know when the jellyfish are gone?'' I asked an Australian.
``Easy,'' he replied. ``I toss my friend in, and if he comes out
all right, then I go in.'') In the capital city of Brisbane,
meanwhile, are the famed Botanic Gardens.

<P>
   Queensland, you're amazing . . . naturally.

   Mention Australia and many think of koalas and kangaroos and
crocodiles and cassowaries. And well they should, because nature
puts on a splendid show. But amid all the natural wonders, some
visitors may be surprised to find resorts that offer fine food and
excellent accommodations while keeping in harmony with their
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the top resorts in Tropical North Queensland,
all of which I have at least visited. Costs vary but most places
have packages that lower the prices and add to the amenities. All
have pools and lush landscaping, offer nature excursions, and serve
good food, including Australia's excellent seafood and lamb, as
well as the nation's excellent wines.
</P>
<P>
   Kewara Beach Resort, 20 minutes north of Cairns in Northern
Queensland, is surrounded by forests and the Coral Sea. Its design,
including wooden carvings and Aboriginal artifacts, is intended to
reflect the lifestyle and traditions of the Torres Strait
Islanders. Listed prices begin at about $125 US per room. Phone
800-525-4800 or, on the Web, visit www.kewarrabeachresort.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Thala Beach Lodge is some 12 miles south of the lively village
of Port Douglas. The 145-acre resort includes 1.2 miles of sandy
beach. Even a walk along that beach there has its rewards, such as
the sight of parrots in the nearby trees. Listed prices begin at
about $155 US. Call 07-4057-5300 or visit www.thalabeach.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Silky Oaks Lodge, also near Port Douglas, is literally
surrounded by the Daintree rain forest _ a platypus is even said to
inhabit the resort's waters. There are 60 chalets near treetop
level and overlooking the Mossman River. On the lodge grounds is a
nursery where orphaned wallabies are taken care of until they are
mature enough to be returned to the forest. The two I met, Sandy
and Sheila, weren't at all shy. Listed prices begin at about $255
US. Phone 132-469 in Australia or e-mail
resorts-reservations(at)poaustralia.com.
</P>
<P>
   Reef House is a boutique hotel in the pleasant beach town of
Palm Cove, and is built so that it seems to be an extension of the
outdoors, with its ferns, bougainvillea, gardens, and three
swimming pools. The Corals Restaurant is a good place to try those
lobsterlike crustaceans, bay bugs, which taste a lot better than
their name sounds. Cocktails include a ``strawgasm,'' made with
chcolate and strawberry liqueurs and cream. Listed room prices
begin at about $148 US. Call 61-74055-3633.
</P>
<P>
   The Great South Pacific Express is a luxury hotel, a grand
restaurant, and a scenic ride all in one. The latest member of the

   Hayman frequently pops up in lists of the world's five top
resorts. A favorite of celebrities, luxury lovers, and nature fans
alike, Hayman boasts scenery that rivals even that of my beloved
Hawaii. Tropical gardens and white-sand beaches help this 31-acre
resort blend in with the rest of 960-acre Hayman Island, the
northernmost of the Whitsunday Islands. There are 203 rooms
overlooking swimming pools, beaches, and the sea. There are also
six restaurants ranging from formal to casual, and a wine cellar
with more than 20,000 bottles. A wedding chapel sits on a hill. And
throughout the grounds there are statuary, paintings, gardens,
shops, a children's club, a library, and game rooms. Activities
include tennis, squash, table tennis, volleyball, a nine-hole
putting green, nature walking, a dive center, parasailing,
waterskiing, fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving, windsurfing, and
boating. Helicopters and seaplanes are also available for exploring
the islands, and excursions include a day at Whitehaven, one of the
world's best beaches. Hayman, not surprisingly, is a member of
Leading Hotels of the World. Listed prices range from about $350 to
about $2,000 US. Phone 800-223-6800.

   Believe it or not, if you want to go where it's warm for the
millennium, you can, and without paying a premium. And, if you want
to go where it can be cold, very cold, few places say winter with a
warmer welcome than Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have been turned off by the prices being quoted
for trips over the millennium. Too high a price to pay for the trip
of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all that's changing,'' said Claire Gorayeb, vice
president of marketing at TNT Vacations. TNT is known for offering
value-packed charter vacations, and for the millennium they have
not only some great prices, but also space.
</P>
<P>
   Aruba has packages beginning at $999 leaving Dec. 25-26 (only
Dec. 26 departures are sold out); other destinations with space
available leaving on either Dec. 25 or 26 are Cozumel (was $1,199
now beginning at $899); Antigua (was $2,049, now from $1,049);
Cancun (was $1,799, now $999); St. Maarten, now from $1,399; Punta
Cana, now from $1,599, and Playa del Carmen, was $2,399 and now is
from $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are all-inclusive vacations (all meals, drinks,

del Carmen at $1,499. Travel agents have details, or call
800-GO-TNT-GO.
</P>

   And, if you are looking for the hot spot of 2000, Gorayeb says,
it's Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. The beach is
unbelievable, and the prices are great, she says.

   In Quebec even the snowmen have a jolly look and welcoming smile
_ especially that happy symbol of the Quebec Winter Carnvial,
Bonhomme Carnival. This annual winter festival, Jan. 28-Feb. 13, is
one of the biggest in the world and includes dog sledding, ice
climbing, a canoe race across the frozen St. Lawrence River,
glittering night parades, tobogganing, snow sculpture competition
(last year 19 countries participated), and a lot more.

   Quebec City, North America's only walled city, is particularly

   If you're looking for some wonderful cultural experiences,
Montreal is the place to head. In winter, you can travel throughout
the city without ever stepping outdoors. Underground Montreal is a
place to discover.
</P>
<P>
   So think winter, think Quebec for some new experiences. Skiers,
too, will find new discoveries at Mont Tremblant, just outside
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years Tremblant has been transformed into
a world-class ski resort with a wonderful village almost slopeside,

the Saturday Evening Post built their audiences around the visual
appeal of illustrations, especially on magazine covers,'' said
Christopher Clarke-Hazlett, guest curator at the museum. ``The Post
circulated among more American households, generated more
advertising revenue, and exerted more influence over popular

<P>
   Survival may be the first priority when one receives a diagnosis
of cancer, but at some point many patients become concerned with
the effects that battling the disease will have on their sexuality
and, ultimately, their self-esteem and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Oncology Nursing Society's 10th Annual Fall
Institute in Salt Lake City, two health-care professionals outlined
the problems cancer patients face in terms of their sexuality, and
discussed strategies to help them cope and overcome their
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Whether dealing with hair loss or fatigue, the vast majority of
cancer patients have some worries that relate, either directly or
indirectly, to their sexuality. But in the past, the focus has
often been mainly on concrete sexual problems, such as impotence or
vaginal dryness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the research that has been done has been in focused
cancer groups,'' said presenter Sandra Mitchell, a nurse
practitioner at the University of Maryland Cancer Center in
Baltimore. ``We don't have a good sense of how widespread the
problem is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexual issues arising from cancer are typically disease-,
treatment- and/or gender- specific, commented Edward B. Rubenstein,
M.D., associate professor of medicine at the M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, treatment of prostate, testicular, ovarian and
breast cancers can directly impact one's sexuality. For prostate
cancer, a significant minority of men who receive surgery or
radiation become impotent, and hormonal therapy causes what is
called chemical castration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those patients lose sexual desire and function,'' Rubenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   For women, a mastectomy isn't simply the removal of a breast;
it's also the disfigurement of a sexual organ that for many is a
symbol of their femininity.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation to pelvic areas can decrease a woman's natural vaginal
lubrication, and hormonal therapies often wreak havoc on sexuality.
The libido suffers greatly, said presenter Judy Shell, R.N., a
Ph.D. candidate who is a medical family therapist at Central
Florida Cancer Centers in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Even with cancers not related to sexual organs, systemic
treatment may cause problems, for example raising the specter of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphoma, for instance, requires fairly aggressive chemotherapy.
``If the patients are in the reproductive ages, they may lose
gonadal function,'' Rubenstein said. ``It may be permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon cancer patients often have to wear a colostomy bag, and
head-and-neck cancer patients may have a tracheotomy tube or
discoloring of the face due to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of issues really impact a person's sexuality and
how they view themselves as men and women,'' said Shell. ``Who we
are as men and women can be impacted no matter what the cancer
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair loss, one of the most common and visible effects of cancer
treatment, can devastate a person's self-image as a sexual being.
``Hair is a symbol of social status, personality and attraction,''
Shell said. ``Baldness can signify illness, and, culturally, ill
and sick people are asexualized.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting also play havoc with one's
sexuality. ``A lot of the aggressive chemotherapies knock you for a
loop,'' Rubenstein said. ``The side effects can be pretty
debilitating and can interfere with sexual desire.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most basic psychological level, cancer and subsequent
treatment can affect a patient's sexuality by undermining their
view of themselves as capable, healthy human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every patient has some sexuality concerns, not just in terms
of intimate sexual relations, but who they are as men and women,''
Shell said. ``Sexuality is not just sex.''
</P>
<P>
   For single patients, the question becomes: Who will find me
attractive, and how or what do I tell any potential partners about
the disease?
</P>
<P>
   For those already involved with someone, the illness forever
alters that relationship. ``Cancer affects the relationship,
sometimes for the good, and sometimes not for the good,'' Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that sexuality isn't simply intercourse, Shell said
that when battling cancer, many patients need some level of
intimacy and support. ``Often, they're more interested in just
[being] held,'' she said. ``They need to feel connected and loved.
They need a sense of security, which is really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell tells couples dealing with cancer to talk. ``At the point
in time they should be closest to someone, that's when they're
furthest apart,'' she said. ``One of our jobs is to help them
communicate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to sexuality, however, communication in general is
often a problem, since the topic is often seen as taboo by patients
and doctors preoccupied with fighting cancer. Patients may think
sex shouldn't be a priority, Shell said, or they may have been told
this in no uncertain terms by health-care professionals. When
raising questions about sex, some patients have heard they should
be happy to be alive. ``People have been reprimanded,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said it's important that doctors and nurses have the
kind of relationship with their patients in which they can talk
about these problems, or at least refer them to someone who can.
``It's not something you're generally going to talk to your
next-door neighbor about,'' she said. ``It's a very private
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Health-care professionals can also provide simple, commonsense
tips to facilitate sexuality, Shell said. For instance, Shell
counsels those who experience fatigue to schedule sexual activity
around the time of day they feel most energetic, even though it may
not be their usual time for intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Simplicity is key to overcoming some of these concerns. After
battling breast cancer, Jacqueline Brandwynne became engrossed in
the topic of women's sexuality during and after cancer treatment.
She consulted cancer patients, therapists and gynecologists, and
developed a vaginal lubricant for her Very Private line of
products. She also composed a seven-step program to guide women
back into their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do things that are real,'' Brandwynne said. ``(The
seven-step program) gives them a logical sequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Before doctors and nurses can offer any help, they have to
reevaluate their view of sexuality, both Shell and Mitchell noted.
The preferred model, they agreed, should incorporate physiological,
interpersonal, psychological and cultural aspects of the patients
and their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also very important to validate for the person the
importance of their concerns,'' Mitchell said, ``and normalize
those concerns.''

1999 COLTS: HORSES OF A DIFFERENT COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of a joyous celebration hours after a dramatic win
in Miami that stamped his team ``for real,'' a friend leaned over
and asked Indianapolis general manager Bill Polian: ``Can we fit
all of these guys in under the salary cap next year?''
</P>
<P>
   Polian realized that no matter how many games his upstart Colts
win, the reality is, he is going to have a difficult job keeping
this promising young team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enjoying the win until that moment,'' said Polian with a
laugh, ``but there was the thought of the salary cap right in the
middle of my mind again. It's like a toothache. It's always there.
It never goes away. There are times when you don't think about it,
but then it always comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, at 10-2, are in first place in the NFL's toughest
division, the AFC East, and have the best young team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Bill Parcells said earlier this year about us,'' offered
Polian, ``when you have a good young team, you have salary cap
problems. But the important thing we have to do is to take
advantage of these players while we have them, and to keep our core
group together as long as we possibly can. In this league, under
the present rules, the window of opportunity only lasts so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts had a monster win last Sunday, beating the Dolphins,
34-31, in a shootout that went right down to the wire, but Polian
said it was not their biggest victory of the season. He thought the
most important win was against the Jets in New York the sixth week
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Polian's explanation requires a little setting up.
</P>
<P>
   In Week 2 against the Patriots, his young team built a 28-7
halftime lead but allowed the Patriots to come back for a 31-28
victory in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   In Week 5, the Colts built another big lead, this time at home
against Miami, and watched it evaporate. Miami scored 25 points in
the second half and was helped at the finish by a controversial
officiating call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team was devastated after that Miami game,'' said Polian.
``We had our guts ripped out. When I walked in our locker toom
after the game, it was like walking into a losing Super Bowl locker
room'' _ which Polian did four times as GM of the Buffalo Bills.
``That's the only thing I could relate it to. We got a bad deal on
a call at the end of the game, and we all felt we had the game
taken away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   His team was 2-2 after four weeks, which is just about what the
preseason prognosticators felt they would be (the Colts were a
consensus pick to finish last in the AFC East). After crushing
defeats to preseason favorites New England and Miami, there was no
telling which way the young team was going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go into New York to play Parcells and the Jets, and
we knew that was going to be tough,'' said Polian. ``It's always
tough to go up against him. But Jim Mora was great that week.
Everything he said and did in practice was positive. He wouldn't
let our kids get down. He kept pumping them up, telling them we
were going to win and get back on track. Then we won the game
(16-13) on a big play at the end, and that turned the season for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Colts have ripped off eight straight. Their
offense, directed by second-year quarterback Peyton Manning, and
built around the running of rookie Edgerrin James and wide receiver
Marvin Harrison, is the most explosive in the game.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was a move that Polian made back in the spring that
helped make this surprising surge _ from last to first in 12 months
_ possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly,'' said Polian, ``there are some things that have
happened that have surprised us as well. We thought we had a chance
to be pretty good but knew the only way it could happen was if all
the pieces fell in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``James was the most difficult part of it, and he has played far
beyond any expectations we had for him. We knew we had to let
Marshall Faulk go. We also knew he was an outstanding player and
had over 2,000 combined yards for us the year before. We felt that
no matter what we did, we couldn't make up for those yards. But
James has done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second part is the continued growth of Manning and
Harrison. A year ago they showed they had the potential to be a
great passing combination. But we didn't know if they would
continue to improve, and they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, we lost two wide receivers and had to use (Terrance)
Wilkins. We knew he was a terrific kick returner, and insurance as
a wideout, but since we were forced to play him because of injury
to two other players, he has been tremendous. Every game he makes
at least one big play in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we went out and picked up some veteran free agents to
help us on defense. Our defense was just about the worst in the
league last year. (Defensive end) Chad Bratzke had to continue to
play the way he did with the Giants, and he did. (Linebacker)
Cornelius Bennett had to be reborn, and give us a big lift. He has.
Bennett is playing like the Bennett we had in Buffalo. On
Wednesdays he looks dead. On Sundays, he plays like he has
discovered the fountain of youth.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots get to Indianapolis this Sunday, it will be a
different setting than the one they have been accustomed to over
the years. There will be no empty seats; all are sold for the rest
of the year. And no fans sitting on their hands, waiting for
something bad to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our building is alive,'' said Polian. ``We have finally gotten
it to be an advantage for us.''

TROY BROWN GETS TO SPREAD HIS WINGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The catch was just the beginning. When Troy
Brown twisted to receive a pass from Drew Bledsoe at the 45-yard
line Sunday night, his momentum continued to carry him downfield.
He reached the 30 before any Dallas defenders caught on. A would-be
tackler grabbed at Brown's waist but quickly slipped to the turf as
the elusive receiver ran laterally.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could prevent Brown from crossing the sideline to stop
the clock. As the final moments of the second quarter elapsed _
with the Patriots trying to score before halftime _ Brown eluded
one Cowboy after another. Deion Sanders finally wrapped his arms
around Brown. Still, Brown spun the cornerback in a big circle as
he stepped out of bounds. All Sanders could do was snap his fingers
at the receiver that got away.
</P>
<P>
   In the larger scheme of a snapped losing streak and reawakened
playoff hopes, it was easy to forget the 19-yard catch Brown made
late in the half. But it was just the type of play the receiver
prides himself on. It is also just the type of effort the Patriots
need as they make their push for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be involved,'' said Brown. ``With this team and the
players here, the opportunities are few and far between, so you
have to make the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to set a fire under some of these guys. They come over
and say, `I like the way you play. You get me all pumped up.' A
5-yard catch you turn into 15 yards, break a couple of tackles on
it, run over a couple people and it gets everybody jacked up.
That's the thing we need on this team to get everybody going.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Dallas, New England (and Brown) benefited from a spread
offense that employed five receivers. It was a new look emphasized
at practice last week and is likely to remain in the playbook for
the rest of the season. At a time when offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese has been criticized for predictability, the five-receiver
package showed resourcefulness and a hint of creative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Creativeness on the part of the coaches was rewarded with extra
effort by the players, particularly the receivers. They played
physically, took on defenders, and tried to make greater gains. In
the process, they silenced concerns about their ability to get off
the line and get free.
</P>
<P>
   The more open set-up allowed Brown to be at his best, catching
the ball and then running for more yardage. He led the Patriots
with four receptions for 40 yards. Brown also contributed three
punt returns for 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Brown just needs to get the ball,'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``He does good things not only on the punt returns, but
catching and running. He was effective again. He's an important guy
on third down for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to motivate teammates has increasingly made Brown an
essential part of the New England offense. But it took time for
coaches to realize the impact that a 5-foot-10-inch, 190-pound wide
receiver could make.
</P>
<P>
   In college, Brown starred at Division 1-AA Marshall, but then he
struggled during the early years of his professional career. He was
cut from the Patriots by Bill Parcells in August 1994, but after
unsuccessful tryouts with Carroll's Jets and the Kansas City
Chiefs, Brown's career path led back to Foxborough at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   He soon began to show that he belonged. In 1995 and '96, Brown
played in every regular-season game. In 1997, he started in place
of an injured Terry Glenn for six games, setting career highs with
41 receptions, 607 yards, and 6 touchdowns. Last season, he was the
team's primary punt returner and reserve receiver.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Brown has caught 22 passes for 297 yards and a
touchdown. Still the team's primary punt returner, he has 24
returns for 190 yards (7.9-yard average). Against Kansas City in
mid October, Brown sprained his left ankle on a kickoff return and
has not been put in that position again. He missed three games with
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a playmaker,'' said Zampese. ``Every time he touches the
football, something good happens. We'd love to get him involved
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-receiver package would be one way. Against the Cowboys,
Brown's most important reception came during the Patriots
fourth-quarter touchdown drive. On second and 6, he caught an
11-yard pass to move the ball to the Dallas 17.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese hopes the five-receiver sets will frustrate defenses by
presenting matchup difficulties. And Brown believes it will make
Bledsoe's job easier by making it less likely that the quarterback
will force passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it,'' said Brown. ``All the guys enjoy it as
receivers. I don't think the running backs enjoy it a whole lot.
But I think that it was something we had to do, to spread everyone
out and create some more lanes. It's something new now, so I think
you'll probably see it the rest of the year. We have guys on the
field that can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And Brown ranks right at the top of the list.

   The idea that you could cram another social event into your
schedule this time of year is enough to provoke an anxiety attack.
But what if it's being held at your house and the invitations are
already out and you're at a total loss about what to do? Make the
main event a couple of days in advance, any time you find a couple
of hours. (Look, you probably didn't book midnight to dawn.) In
this case, the entree is a veal stew whose components are roasted
in a hot oven to save standing at the saute pan. Then add a quick
gratin of coarsely crushed potatoes, drizzled only with a little
oil to flavor them and encourage browning, and a salad. With
drinks, offer your own marinated olives, which take several days to
cure. End with sauteed figs and a spoonful of cream. Dilemma
solved. All you have to do is set the buffet table. Oh yes _ and
cook.

<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   6 plum tomatoes, halved
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Extra olive oil (for drizzling and sauteing)
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 leeks, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces and steamed until
tender &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 450 degrees. Trim off any fat from the meat and
toss it in a bowl with the oil until it is coated all over.
Sprinkle it with salt and pepper and spread the meat on a rimmed
baking sheet. Transfer it to the oven and roast it for 10 minutes,
turning once or twice, until the meat is golden brown at the edges.
Remove it from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   In a roasting pan combine the onions, tomatoes, and shiitake
mushrooms. Drizzle them with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Transfer them to the hot oven and roast them for 45 minutes or
until the onions are golden at the tips and the tomatoes have
collapsed. Remove them from the oven and let them sit until they
are cool enough to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Use tongs to pull the skins off the tomatoes; leave the tomatoes
in halves. Coarsely chop the mushrooms. Leave the onions in
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a large flameproof casserole, heat enough oil to film the
bottom of the pan. Add the celery and leeks and cook over low heat,
stirring often, for 8 minutes or until the leeks are softened. Add
the flour and stir thoroughly over low heat for 3 minutes or until
the flour begins to brown at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Add the stock and wine gradually, stirring. Cook over high heat,
stirring constantly, until the liquids come to a boil and thicken
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the contents of the veal pan into the casserole. Add all
the vegetables and any liquid that accumulated in the pan, the bay
leaf, and half the thyme sprigs with stems.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil and transfer the pan to the oven. Set the cover
on askew. Cook the stew for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is
very tender, turning it in the liquid several times.
</P>
<P>
   Use tongs to remove the thyme and bay leaf from the liquid. Use
a slotted spoon to lift the meat and vegetables from the pan and
transfer them to a bowl. (If making in advance, use a plastic
container for the meat and vegetables; cover and refrigerate
overnight.)
</P>
<P>
   Leave the liquid in the casserole. (If making in advance, tip
the liquid into a separate plastic container; cover and
refigerate.)
</P>
<P>
   Bring the cooking liquid to a boil and let it simmer for 20
minutes or until it reduces and thickens slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, remove the thyme leaves from the remaining sprigs and
chop the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Season the stew to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Return the meat to the liquid, add the carrots and thyme. Let
the liquid come to a boil and simmer 2 minutes. Serve at once.

WOMEN FIND BALANCE IN BIOTECH WORKPLACE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON _ Conventional wisdom has it that men run the show in
the world of technology.
</P>
<P>
   But in the laboratories and executive suites of biotechnology,
the workplace has been relatively hospitable to women. In small and
medium-sized biotech firms, for instance, up to 50 percent of
research scientists are women.
</P>
<P>
   The reason has largely to do with balancing work and family,
according to a study by the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute due
out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech is a more friendly environment for professional women
than academia and most industries,'' said Paula Rayman, director of
the Radcliffe institute and a principal author of the study,
entitled ``Professional Pathways: Examining Work, Family, and
Community in the Biotechnology Industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the relatively young companies in
Greater Boston's biotech industry offer ``relatively reasonable
hours, enabling parents, and particularly women, to have
professional science careers while raising children.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike older industries, biotechnology is largely a product of
the 1990s. Biotech firms tend to be small and young. Without an old
boys' network or other hiring baggage, women have gotten in on the
ground floor. Thus, it's an industry with a significant fraction of
women at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Una S. Ryan, president and chief executive of Avant
Immunotherapeutics Inc., maintains that women scientists are
attracted to biotechnology because they are judged solely by their
work, rather than office politics or other variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, women scientists can be enthused and really concentrate
on their work and not fight the extraneous issues of making sure
everything is fair,'' said Ryan, whose research department now has
17 women and 19 men.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech scientists also work on projects that have long
development times; it can take up to 10 years to develop a drug.
Since science cannot be hurried, there is not the pell-mell rush
found with Internet start-ups. That puts less time pressure on the
average workday at biotech firms, enabling flexible work schedules,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that unlike the rich pharmaceutical industry,
small biotech firms are financially vulnerable, some scrambling for
money to meet payrolls, others facing changing strategies due to
scientific uncertainties _ all of which can lead to layoffs and
company closings.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech professionals, however, say the rewards of the drug
discovery research and the experiences they gain at cutting-edge
science outweigh most job security issues, according to the study.
Moreover, if a biotech professional's employer founders, she
probably can find another job relatively easily because the
industry is growing. And chances are good that the next job will
have flexible hours and possibly part-time positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech careers present new patterns that allow professionals
to tolerate more job uncertainty and economic vulnerability than
professions of old,'' the Radcliffe study found.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, men and women biotech professionals view their work
environment as a middle ground between pharmaceutical laboratories,
which tend to operate under traditional corporate hierarchies, and
academia, which has research autonomy but a ``publish or perish
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The study reported that women see academic science as the most
difficult environment, making biotechnology look good in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all is not rosy in biotech, the study suggests. Among the
findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Doctoral degrees seem necessary for women to move up to senior
jobs, compared to men, who have advanced with lesser academic
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   --Men hold the majority of the most influential and
well-compensated positions in biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   --Individual negotiations and accommodations remain the primary
ways to set up long-term alternative work arrangements. Typically,
there is no policy that benefits everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Although biotech is seen as a workplace of the future, the study
found that women in biotech still shoulder the majority of family
responsibilites, such as child rearing, despite more flexible hours
than those in other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunities to create more flexible work arrangements that
could benefit both employees and employers are seldom exploited in
any systematic way,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Cheryl Murphy, a mother of two and an executive at
Aquila Biopharmaceuticals Inc., has found. Having spent 12 years at
the company and its predecessor, Cambridge Biotechnology Inc., she
said the company is good with informal arrangements if her children
are sick, but there is no flex time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company does not help with day care issues,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Michelle Eldrige, a manufacturing supervisor at
Genzyme Tissue Repair in Cambridge, said company benefits include a
service that helped her to place an advertisement in local papers
to find child care for her two children, along with a flexible
schedule. She works four 10-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot beat the benefits,'' said Eldridge, who has six men
and no women reporting to her.
</P>
<P>
   The Radcliffe report, which included 100 interviews and five
focus groups, is based largely on studies of employees at three
small Massachusetts companies: Aquila of Framingham, Avant of
Needham, and Cambridge-based Genzyme Tissue Repair, which is a
majority-owned subsidiary of Genzyme Corp. Both Aquila and Avant
have female chief executives.

RUSSIAN NEWSCASTS GET LURID AS VOTE NEARS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A soft-porn video featuring the federal prosecutor. A
prostitute talking about her politician clients. Public officials
tied to religious cults. A sadistic kidnapper executing a terrified
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights from the latest Hollywood thriller? No, it's the
prime-time news on Russian television. With parliamentary elections
just weeks away here, television has become a blunt weapon. And as
politicians use their media empires to sling slime at one another
before a cynical and bewildered public, subtlety, and often taste,
are the first victims.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday night, Russia's major television networks broadcast
``60 Minutes''-style current affairs programs that are supposed to
enlighten the public about the hot issues of the day. But lately
the issues have become so hot that it is a good idea to put the
kids to bed before watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are not for young children,'' said Leonid
Kesselman, a St. Petersburg-based sociologist, adding that when he
watches the Sunday night news shows, he makes sure his 6-year-old
son is nowhere near the television set.
</P>
<P>
   The top rated of these programs is ``The Sergei Dorenko Show,''
broadcast on ORT television _ Russia's largest network, reaching 98
percent of this vast country's homes. In October Dorenko showed an
eight-minute film of a man he claimed was federal prosecutor Yury
Skuratov frolicking in bed naked with two prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Before showing the video, Dorenko _ one of Russia's best known
and most trusted news anchors _ looked earnestly into the camera
and told viewers that he ``agonized for a long time about whether
to show the tape,'' but decided that ``nobody can limit the right
of people to know all about their leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorenko did, however, warn parents not to allow their children
to watch, because if they did, they would have ``a hard time
teaching them patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Why show a film of prosecutorial sex on the evening news? Most
here say the broadcast and others like it are weapons in Russia's
political battles on the eve of elections.
</P>
<P>
   The ORT network is controlled by Kremlin-connected tycoon Boris
Berezovsky, and the station vigorously protects the interests of
President Boris N. Yeltsin and his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov found himself on ORT's hit list after he initiated
corruption allegations against Yeltsin's family and some of the
president's closest allies, including Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Another one of Dorenko's and ORT's favorite targets is Moscow
Mayor Yury Luzhkov, a Kremlin foe who heads the opposition
political party Fatherland-All. In a particularly bizarre segment
during a broadcast this week, Dorenko showed an image of Luzhkov's
face and used computer graphics to make him resemble, among other
people, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, viewers across Russia tune into Dorenko's program.
Some watch because they believe him and think he is exposing
corruption in high places, while others, curious about what Dorenko
will do next, watch for the shock value.
</P>
<P>
   And some simply view his program as a form of comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch these programs purely for entertainment and don't take
them seriously,'' said Tatyana Semyonova, a 50-year-old postal
worker. ``Every time I watch these shows it makes me feel superior
to the authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   And for viewers who aren't entertained by what one television
station is offering, changing the channel rarely helps.
</P>
<P>
   On the same night that Dorenko was offering up sex as news,
another station called TV-Center, which is controlled by Luzhkov,
was giving its viewers blood. On a program called ``Secret Files,''
TV-Center broadcast graphic footage of a hostage in Chechnya being
beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to showing the footage, the show's host said that he had
information that Berezovsky, and by implication the Kremlin, was
tied to kidnapping rings in Chechnya that were committing similar
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of allegations flying across Russia's airwaves
can be bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   ORT's Dorenko has accused Luzhkov of having ties to the Japanese
cult Aum Shrinrikyo, which in 1995 used sarin gas in a deadly
attack in the Tokyo subway. The station has also accused Luzhkov
and his allies of complicity in the 1996 murder of American
businessman Paul Tatum.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the opposition NTV television station, which
is sympathetic to Luzhkov, offers its viewers a steady diet of
reporting on corruption in the Kremlin. The station has led a
campaign to expose abuses among Yeltsin's inner circle of informal
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all very harmful for the public's trust in the
authorities,'' said Kesselman, the sociologist. ``But in the long
run this could turn out to have a positive effect. The less people
are prepared to trust the authorities, the more they are able to
reach their own conclusions.

IMPROVEMENTS FOUND IN THIS YEAR'S SCHOOL TEST RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>

   BOSTON _ The wealthiest communities in Massachusetts continue to
produce the most impressive MCAS results, but the more important
scores come from those districts that showed significant
improvement _ a hodgepodge of tiny towns, charter schools, and
small cities sprinkled across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Provincetown, Petersham, Swampscott, Gardner, and the
Renaissance Charter School in Boston all showed notable increases
in this year's MCAS results compared to the 1998 scores, according
to a Globe analysis of the district results released by the state
Department of Education Tuesday. Some of the communities improved
districtwide while others only in certain grades.
</P>
<P>
   Even Boston, whose overall score remains at the bottom of the
MCAS rankings, had some reason to celebrate: Boston schools were
among the top 60 most improved districts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   These districts, among others, had more students who scored
higher than last year's test takers. That means, for example, that
student performance jumped from the `failing' category to `needs
improvement' or from `proficient' to `advanced,' thanks to
everything from educators teaching to the test, to sheer luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Harvard, which for the second year was the number
one scoring school district overall, superintendent Mihran Keoseian
gave partial credit for that achievement to ``the gene pool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is ours to lose, given the gene pool that comes
through the door,'' Keoseian said. ``Our kids are well-prepared.
But it's not just the kids.'' He said good and disciplined
teaching, an intense focus on writing across the grades, rigorous
homework assignments, and class participation also played a part.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the state imploring districts all year to teach to
the MCAS test, Keoseian said he sent out a mandate that teachers
not teach to the test. Even so, the curriculum and teaching methods
there have again propelled the town's schools to the top of the
MCAS heap.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessement System is the
barometer of seven years of Education Reform, an initiative to
equalize education in the state and improve achievement. Given to
students in grades 4, 8, and 10 last spring, the 10th grade exam
will become a requirement for graduation for the class of 2003.
Students will have to pass the math and English portion of the exam
with a score of 220 on both subjects.
</P>
<P>
   While some school districts celebrated their scores, other
educators were also cautious: Small numbers of students being
tested can significantly skew results, it typically takes three
years of data to develop a solid trend, and it will continue to
take years of work to graduate students who will be able to compete
in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very small school in a very small town and if a child
is on either end of this thing, it can change the outcome a lot,''
said Glenede Albertine, the fourth grade teacher at the Petersham
Center School. Petersham had the most improved fourth grade
statewide, with a cumulative score 4 percent higher than last
year's, according to the Globe analysis.
</P>
<P>
   There were only 10 fourth-graders in the school and all took the
exam last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Albertine and others acknowledged that their efforts at
academic improvements were paying off. After-school, Saturday, and
summer programs, aligning curriculum with MCAS, and encouraging
teachers to band together to push students toward excellence were
all credited with helping boost scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, we took the approach that we were going to
administer this test without impacting our sacred programs in the
school,'' said Peter Sack, principal of Swampscott High School. The
district was ranked 74th in the state by a Globe analysis last
year, and this year came in 23d.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we got the (1998) results, we came to a different
conclusion and decided MCAS reigns supreme,'' Sack said, ``and we
did anything we needed to to create a positive testing
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sack said teachers motivated the 10th graders by, in part,
imploring them to take pride in their community and help educators
figure out how to better prepare other students for the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them, `If you give it your best shot, and we see what
went wrong, we'll know this is an area we can improve on so your
younger brothers and sisters can do better on the test,' '' Sack
said. ``And it worked. The kids did an extraordinary job.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fay, a headmaster at the 1,140-student Renaissance Charter
School in downtown Boston, credited his students with applying
themselves and showing some of the most improved eighth-grade
scores in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time with the eighth-graders telling them
they were doing it for themselves, how important it was for them to
get used to test-taking,'' Fay said. ``We extended math and reading
blocks and familarized the kids with test taking and terms. One
year doesn't make a trend but we are working hard here. I am proud
of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayland this year also can boast about the eighth-grade scores:
Wayland's eighth grade was the best in the state. Principal Richard
Schaye attributes the students' success to changes made after last
year's MCAS results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We increased our emphasis on writing, not just in English, but
in math and science as well. We look at any glaring mismatches
between our curriculum and the frameworks. We made very few
wholesale changes because we don't have enough of a history to know
what we would want to change and what we would not want to
change,'' Schaye said. ``We haven't had time yet to know what
caused the increase and we continue to think that the data won't be
fully useful for three to five years when you can see trends and
the population studied gets larger.''
</P>
<P>
   Other districts that can boast best scores in the state include
Conway, for best in fourth grade, and Cohasset, for best in 10th
grade.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials had no comment on the
district-by-district scores, saying they prefer to focus on
individual schools' improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranking the districts is the press looking at box scores and
horse racing,'' said the education department's deputy
commissioner, Alan Safran. ``The commissioner is focusing his
attention on how kids achieve despite tremendous challenges . . .
schools that face high poverty rates and still make kids achieve.
That's what it's all about for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the scores also sparked renewed criticism of the
test throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 educators, parents, and community members in Western
Massachusetts have begun meeting to organize a grass-roots campaign
to suspend testing until there is a statewide dialogue with
educators about what students should be required to know.
</P>
<P>
   And Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly said he expects a court
case to be filed over MCAS because some students are not yet being
taught the material they are being tested on. Indeed, some
curriculum frameworks, such as science, are still incomplete, yet
students are tested on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But many school officials, regardless of their personal opinions
of MCAS, said they believe MCAS is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Provincetown, which won the state's ``most
improved'' recognition both overall and for Grade 8, according to
the Globe analysis, said they are focused on getting students to
perform better on the test and to improve academically overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to acknowledge the work of the principal and staff,''
said Superintendent Susan Fleming. ``We have aligned curriculum,
we're focused on professional development. But staff has encouraged
kids in failure areas to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   While Fleming noted that her tiny district at the tip of Cape
Cod with only 350 students may have had statistical fluctuations
because of its size, she said school staff hold conferences with
students, give extra help to children doing poorly, and celebrate
those students doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about getting kids to believe they can do it,'' Fleming
said. ``Now, it's can we keep these scores going in this
direction?''

GLOOMY DAYS ARE GONE FOR EATON VANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of it as stepping to the plate with two strikes already
against you.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance Corp. was a small mutual fund company competing in
an industry in which a handful of the largest competitors win
nearly all the new business _ week in and week out. Worse, investor
demand for its bread-and-butter bond fund business had all but
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Against that forbidding backdrop, the old-line Boston money
management firm has climbed to unlikely prominence as one of the
fund industry's best-selling stories.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance is still no one's idea of a money management giant,
with about $41 billion under management as of Oct. 31. But that
figure is up 41 percent in a year and has nearly doubled over the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 1999 mutual fund sales, relative to its assets
already under management, are among the industry's most impressive
and dollar-for-dollar are in a virtual dead heat with the much
larger Putnam Investments through the first nine months of the
year, according to Financial Research Corp., a Boston consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a market that has lost its appetite for most financial
stocks, Eaton Vance shares are up 53 percent over the last 12
months. They have soared 247 percent over the last three years,
while other local midzsize money management firms like Liberty
Financial Cos. (up 4 percent) and Pioneer Group (down 37 percent)
have gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much razzle-dazzle in the strategy that propelled
Eaton Vance out of a gloomy situation, but it has proven to be a
potential growth plan for small money management firms that can't
count on supercharged fund performances to lift them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea: Identify small investment market niches and become a
leading competitor within them.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Eaton Vance was undeniably in trouble. Its
prominence as a manager of municipal bond funds and other
fixed-income investments was scarcely a selling point amid a
roaring stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, top managers who controlled Eaton Vance's voting stock
were divided over whether to sell the company or press on. By
September of 1996, managers who wanted Eaton Vance to remain
independent prevailed, and longtime executive James Hawkes
succeeded M. Dozier Gardner as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just dead in the water as an equity manager, going
nowhere,'' Hawkes said. ``In fact, we were going backwards. It was
critical for us to create a growth plan to get our equity products
going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance launched a type of investment that was almost
unheard of at the time, a mutual managed to minimize the tax bite
of gains to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax-managed funds really fit their normal (investment)
profile,'' said mutual fund consultant Geoff Bobroff. ``They were
adroit enough to seize upon it as a strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a product that cut across the fund industry current of
the time, when new investment products all raced to capture money
in 401(k) plans and other retirement plans that faced no immediate
capital gains or income taxes. Often, they traded stocks in their
portfolios to maximize gains without consideration of the tax hit
some customers would pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflict between who you are serving has grown,'' said
Hawkes. ``Our banner was mutual funds for people who pay taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Awareness of after-tax returns has grown since then, trumpeted
most effectively by Vanguard Group. Now there are many more
competitors, but Eaton Vance's three funds (a fourth will be
offered early next year) own about 25 percent of the tax-managed
niche of the mutual fund market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is early in the process, and the concept will
have legs,'' said John Rekenthaler, research director at
Morningstar Inc. ``It has investment validity.'' He predicts funds
will routinely publish pretax and after-tax performance figures
within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton Vance's other investment niche: funds that invest in bank
loans. They aren't glitzy and won't generate huge returns, but the
funds have brought billions of dollars worth of business to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Though more investment firms compete for those customers, Eaton
Vance has its claws on a big chunk of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to the strategy that helped Eaton Vance grow:
success will attract powerful competitors, especially for
tax-managed stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkes isn't worried yet. Eaton Vance has the only tax-managed
international product on the market, and the original growth fund
is an entrenched favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the more people are fighting for the business,
the more the (tax-managed) concept is validated,'' he said. ``It's
kind of our song, and everyone else is singing it. If our
performance continues to be strong and we truly deliver a
tax-efficient fund, we'll do just fine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROCKTON, Mass. _ In this city of 93,000, the United States
Postal Service has become another example of nationwide corporate
belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem: The USPS is a nonprofit government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Brien, president of the South Shore-area local of the
American Postal Workers Union in Brockton, contends the USPS, in
its eagerness to reduce costs, has taken on the characteristics of
a profit-driven corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States Postal Service was never supposed to be a
Wall Street corporation,'' O'Brien said angrily. ``It was supposed
to be a nonprofit agency and a service.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years after its first major reform, the nation's
postal system is facing an identity crisis so massive its future
direction is being debated nationwide from urban areas such as
Brockton to Capitol Hill, where Congress is considering a bill that
would require an overhaul of the system.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: the future of the Postal Service in an era of e-mail
and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 30 percent of the system's revenues, or about $60
billion, is derived from postage on first-class mail such as bills,
payments, and letters. But with competition from the Internet
increasing and more consumers expected to switch to on-line banking
and bill paying, the Postal Service says it could lose up to $17
billion in market share by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with these changes, the Postal Service is undergoing its
own transformation, making a push to compete in a private-sector
market by launching ventures that have more to do with technology
and commerce than with delivering mail.
</P>
<P>
   This competitive drive has brought with it a business
philosophy, one that has included cost-cutting and downsizing
through attrition. For the Postal Workers Union, that has resulted
in an onslaught of union grievances.
</P>
<P>
   In Brockton, under the direction of newly appointed Postmaster
Ron Pauline, the Postal Service has limited light duty to workers
injured on the job and has stripped South Shore letter carriers of
their jeeps, citing a rash of curbside accidents. But the changes
prompted a Dec. 1 protest by about 200 union members and their
supporters, and 888 grievances have been filed this year, up from
238 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, since introducing a buyout program seven years ago
that trimmed about 30,000 employees from its rolls, the agency has
spent the past five years automating more than 400 plants around
the country and training new managers and staff in the latest
technologies. It also hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to study ways to
make mail delivery more efficient, and it has developed standards
aimed at increasing production and ending waste.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the agency is backing the Postal Modernization Act of 1999,
or HR 22. Filed by New York Republican John McHugh, the bill would
allow USPS to establish private companies that would compete
directly in new and existing markets.
</P>
<P>
   One example, says spokesman Cesta Ayers: a private firm to set
up relationships with foreign postal services to ensure that
first-class mail is delivered smoothly between countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are moving in a different direction than we used to
and we're making changes,'' acknowledged Ayers, manager of field
communications at USPS headquarters in Washington, D.C. ``But if we
stay the same, we will go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's new outlook appears to have yielded results.
Revenues have risen to $62 billion this year, up from $54 billion
in 1995. But although it has made a profit each of the last five
years, net income continues to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, the agency is moving aggressively into electronic
media. In August, it launched PC Postage, which allows customers to
download postage stamps from their personal computers. Using their
PC's, customers can also download postage paid priority mailing
labels. The service is also testing an electronic post mark that
would help consumers verify that an e-mail message was received and
that its contents were secure from prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have mail remain relevant to the American
public,'' said Judy de Torok, a USPS spokeswoman. ``We're also
looking at electronic mail boxes and a whole new range of services.
For us the challenge is, how do we continue to reach customers in
the electronic world?''
</P>
<P>
   Under McHugh's bill, which has generated heated debate in
Washington, the Postal Service also could offer discounts to bulk
mailers.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill say that, without an an overhaul of some
sort, the US Postal Service will likely die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we make real changes, the postal service will be faced
with some pretty unsavory options,'' said Dana Johnson, an aide to
McHugh. ``It will have to raise postal rates to 50 cents, and it
may be forced to close many of its 38,000 postal offices,
especially those in rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitor United Parcel Service of America Inc. has come out
against the measure. It maintains the bill would give the agency an
unfair competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   USPS would become a two-pronged organization. On one side, it
would continue to operate with certain government subsidies not
available to private firms, including exemption from sales and
property taxes and other business expenses such as tolls. Although
private entities established under the McHugh bill would not have
special perks, critics fear the government agency could use such
cost savings to help launch the private firms.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency's biggest union, the 360,000-member American
Postal Workers Union, has also been lobbying against the bill since
McHugh introduced it last spring. ``This bill is a vehicle for the
privatization of the US Postal Service and an attack on the
collective bargaining rights of workers,'' said spokesman Thomas
Fahey. ``It would cap postal rate increases and that would
translate into a cap on our wages.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the 240,000-member National Association of Letter
Carriers union says it neither supports nor opposes the measure.
Instead, it has been working on a compromise with the House
subcommittee on the Postal Service, which McHugh chairs. ``We'd
like to see the best piece of legislation developed, and hopefully
that will be legislation we can support,'' said spokesman Drew Von
Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   In Brockton and several other urban communities, workers have
been up in arms. Von Bergen maintains that letter carriers,
concerned about extra work on delivery routes caused by automation,
took their complaints to an arbitrator and recently won a decision
that will raise wages for letter carriers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   While the Postal Service says its changes have nothing to do
with recent labor management problems in urban areas, workers in
Brockton don't see it that way. Locally, postal workers are angry
about the loss of light duty assignments to workers injured off the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not continue to accommodate people on light
indefinitely,'' said Christine Dugas, a USPS spokeswoman. ``In some
cases, we had people in (Brockton) who had been on light duty for
years. By law, we must accommodate people who are injured on the
job, and we do. But we can't do it for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no consolation to Robert Tynan of Brockton. The
61-year-old mechanic has been out of work for months without pay.
He says he had knee replacements in April, but was hoping to return
to work in 90 days. He said he used up 698 hours of sick time and
annual leave and was due to return to work on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to work, I was told that the Postal Service had no
work with any accommodations,'' said Tynan, who has been at home
without pay and is relying on a dwindling savings account. ``In
fact, they said there was no such thing as light duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tynan claims he was injured on the job several years ago, but
never formally filed an accident report on the knee injuries. That
technicality, he said, and the Postal Service's new policy on light
duty, has left him in limbo.

THE SEASONAL SORROWS OF THE JOYES 
</HEADLINE>

Bluefish Cove, MA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Friends,
</P>
<P>
   Here it is: our last Christmas message of the millennium! The
past 12 months have been so busy, it's almost as if we've packed in
a thousand years' worth of fabulous activities since I last wrote
you!
</P>
<P>
   (That's for sure. Managing this family is starting to feel like
a multiple life sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   Jon's successful Y2K consultancy is just wrapping up a few odds
and ends before year-end. World's End Ventures has succeeded beyond
our wildest dreams, and it's comforting to know that Jon's clients,
at least, aren't the ones who will be paying overtime to staff up
their critical facilities on New Year's Eve. Their comfort level
with Jon's superb preparation is 2,000 percent!
</P>
<P>
   (His clients would be nuts to have any living thing within 50
miles of where Jon has worked. He did some software work for
Bluefish Power &AMP; Light, and they've decided to shut down their
generators for 72 hours on either side of New Year's Eve, lest
Jon's data bungling blow everyone to kingdom come. They're sending
free boxes of candles to customers as a subtle hint.)
</P>
<P>
   Jon Jr. is finally out of college, and out of the nest! We think
he's a cinch for law or business school, but he's decided to go his
own way for a while with some educational tourism and exotic
foreign travel. His last letter was from Jerusalem!
</P>
<P>
   (What a future this kid has. Right out of UMass he told us he
got a job as a ``roadie'' _ does that mean drug dealer? _ for a
rock group called Rage Against the Machine. Barely a week later we
spotted him on CNN, stoking fires and hurling Molotov cocktails at
Woodstock '99. The New York state police saw the same footage, so
Jon wired him a one-way ticket to nowhere. Now he's camping
somewhere on the Mount of Olives, peddling magic mushrooms to the
Second Coming crowd. Good work if you can get it . . .)
</P>
<P>
   And how's the ``baby'' of the family? She's 21 years old! We can
hardly believe it! It seems like only yesterday . . . well, I bet
any number of you could fill in the blanks where your own children
are concerned. Johanna's done us proud _ again! _ and decided to go
back to college and finish that degree!
</P>
<P>
   (It seems like only yesterday that she and Tawnee got rousted
for soliciting, except this time they couldn't lap-dance their way
out of juvenile court. The DA laid down the law: Framingham State
or the Framingham Pen. Johanna says she's taking a lot of
ornithology courses to prepare for medical school. Whatever.)
</P>
<P>
   I know, you're thinking: Joyce, what about YOU? Well, I'm just
fine, thank you. My on-line indulgence business,
Send$500You'reSaved.com, proved to be so successful that I sold it
to a multinational conglomerate. I'm using the proceeds to launch
yet another entrepreneurial venture in the travel industry!
</P>
<P>
   (It was when the archdiocese started burning crosses on my lawn
that I thought maybe it was time to sell the pay-for-penance
business back to the people who invented it in the first place. But
I've come up with something even better: East-to-West, first-class
only, round-the-world-plane trips on New Year's Eve!
</P>
<P>
   It's the ultimate millennium party idea _ twenty-fours hours'
worth of New Year's Eve! And the suckers are snapping it up. Wait,
it gets better; I convinced Jon to take the Cairo-Papua New Guinea
flight, by telling him that all the flight attendants were
professional belly dancers. Now if I can just maneuver another
chronically depressed Egypt Air pilot into the cockpit . . .)
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping that 1999 has been as fun and productive for your
family as it has been for ours! A Joye-ous holiday to one and all!
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE JOYES _ JOYCE, JONATHAN, JJ AND JOHANNA.

DICKY BARRETT'S IMPRESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's that time of year again. Shopping. Eating.
Celebrating. Thrashing about an airless subterranean rock club. If
it's December, this must be the Hometown Throwdown _ a raucous,
five-night valentine from the ska-punk heroes the Mighty Mighty
Bosstones to their beloved hometown of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a big year for the Bosstones. The octet scored its
first platinum album (sales exceeding 1 million copies) with
``Let's Face It,'' their fifth album, which soared on the strength
of the hit single ``The Impression That I Get.'' The band was given
a star on the Tower Records Walk of Fame on Newbury Street,
dedicated by none other than the Clash's Joe Strummer.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years of do-it-yourself career moves, the Bosstones
have signed on with a manager, Arthur Spivak, who also handles Tori
Amos. Perhaps most remarkable is that the Bosstones survived the
Seagrams-Universal megamerger with their record contract, not to
mention their spirits and their integrity, intact. The band is
mixing 21 new songs (recorded at the Longview Farms Studio in
Carlyle, Mass.??) this week in New York, which will ultimately be
whittled down to 15 or 16 for the next Mighty Mighty Bosstones
album, due out in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At such a dazzling millennial crossroads, it would be downright
irresponsible not to query the Bosstones' dazzling frontman, Dicky
Barrett, for some insights and hindsight, recollections and
predictions, stock-taking and muckraking. To begin, the singer
would like readers to know that, yes, there were some high points
in the past 1,000 years. Neither Limp Bizkit nor Christina Aguilera
was among them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your fondest Hometown Throwdown memory?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't really say. They kind of all blur. It's like a week
of standing in a cyclone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the proudest moment of your career?
</P>
<P>
   A. (Guffaws. . .) I laugh at the word career.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. OK. What's the proudest moment of your pathetic little life?
</P>
<P>
   A. I attribute it to you! I never thought what I do would be
called a career. Really, standing around at the Rat and
entertaining eight friends. The whole band is built around pride.
We're proud of our city, and we're proud of each other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Complete this sentence: In 20 years I hope to be. . .
</P>
<P>
   A. Buried? No. As happy as I am today.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the most valuable lesson you've learned?
</P>
<P>
   A.
</P>
<P>
   That I barely know anything and knowing that when you realize
that, you know a lot. I think it might tie in with ignorance is
bliss.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your biggest regret?
</P>
<P>
   A. At the risk of sounding Sinatra-esque, regrets . . . I've had
so few. Too few to mention.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're disturbingly well-adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. My friends say, ``Dude, you're still the same dude.''
You know, you have to start out being Marilyn Manson to become
Marilyn Manson. Although he's very pleasant to me.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have a philosophy that sustains you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing I can really put into words. It's the way I live.
I've always considered people to be the most important.
</P>
<P>
   (The conversation derails when first one maid, then another,
lets herself into Barrett's room at Manhattan's tony Paramount
Hotel. Barrett begins ballparking the distance from his bed to the
wall (12 inches), his bed to the bathroom (12 inches), and his bed
to the front door (12 inches). The mathematical correlation between
the room size and the nightly rate troubles him.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your favorite beer?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is bad, but I like Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does plaid matter?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah. Absolutely, to me and my life. It's definitely the
flag. When we first started wearing it there was very little plaid
anywhere, and it was one of the things we did to set ourselves
apart. Fans latched onto it, the symbolism of it, the multicolors,
coming from north, south, east, and west. Plaid is the symbol of
everything we are. We don't cover everything we own any more, but
it's in our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you doing New Year's Eve?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But there are people already
staking out their spots in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   (Brief but poignant discussion ensues about Dick Clark's
diminished role in the upcoming New Year's festivities, followed by
discussion of whether Clark rang in Y1K.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you going Hollywood? (Barrett recently appeared as Bill
Haley in the television film ``Shake, Rattle, and Roll'')
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yeah. The offers are just rolling in for the Bill Haley
guy. I'm gonna be like Adam West, the guy who played Batman on TV.
I'm gonna be (upset) if other people play Bill Haley.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the best thing about Boston?
</P>
<P>
   A. Everything. It's such a wonderful place. Name a category.
History? People? Music? Growing up I never even thought I'd ever
see any place else. (He grew up in Norwood and since then has lived
in several Boston neighborhoods and Cambridge.) I've never been
tempted to leave. Now having been to so many different places, I
still feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would you like to do that you haven't done?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd like to do a good TV appearance. This is probably pretty
shallow and selfish of me. But this is strictly the band. . . . We
haven't done Letterman or ``Saturday Night Live'' and been
satisfied with it. I'd also like to solve Boston's homeless
problem. One or the other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you could go back in time and change anything, what would
you change?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bill Haley's haircut. I'd give him a cooler 'do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Project a few weeks into the future and complete this
sentence: On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me .
. .
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't really want to tell you. Well, I don't need anything.
I get nice sweaters and really good books.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Choose four objects to put into a time capsule that will be
opened in 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   A. A plaid jacket. The Red Sox were really classy this year. OK,
they didn't go all the way. But I wasn't disappointed. So a Red Sox
cap. I'd probably put in Michael MacDonald's book, ``All Souls.''
It's about a kid from Southie. And how about a Clash album? I would
say the boxed set, ``Clash on Broadway.'' We need something punk
rock.

 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In Rick Pitino's best-selling business book, ``Success
is a Choice,'' the Boston Celtics coach urges readers to recapture
the optimism of youth in their lives and careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to feel once again that the world is full of
possibilities,'' Pitino says.
</P>
<P>
   The heralded coach clearly follows his own advice. When it comes
to Pitino's life and career, the possibilities seemingly are
endless.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing a variety of ventures away from the parquet floor,
Pitino has created an extensive shadow career. He may not yet have
the fortunes of the Boston Celtics turned around, but he is
creating his own fortune. Neither Pitino nor his representatives
would comment, but information culled from his business partners
and from observers suggests that his ancillary incomes add at least
25 percent to his annual coaching salary of $5 million _ and closer
to 40 percent in a year when he publishes a book.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino is one of a tiny group of coaches capable of using their
talents as communicators and motivators to develop lucrative
enterprises on the side. While coaches have long sought additional
incomes from things like shoe endorsements and local television
shows, Pitino is a leading example of a more recent trend: the
coach as conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a select group that also includes Bill Parcells and John
Madden from the NFL and Pat Riley and Phil Jackson in the NBA,''
said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a
Chicago company that links advertisers with sports figures. ``They
are attractive to the business world and intelligent enough to know
how to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, suggest that Pitino's marketability has
been diminished by the lack of a quick turnaround in the Celtics'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has been held back by three things: the NBA strike,
the poor performance of the team, and the fact that he commands top
dollar,'' said a marketing official at a major Boston firm, who
requested anonymity. ``When your team is in the tank, you're not
that popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that, away from the Celtics, this coach
could almost call himself Pitino Inc. _ a far-flung, highly
diversified corporation that walks on two legs.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the most highly paid motivational speakers in the
country, much in demand by Fortune 500 companies that, according to
observers, pay him $40,000 to $60,000 per appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be one of the best speakers I have ever heard in my
life,'' said Matt Meli, a senior vice president for J. Walter
Thompson, the advertising firm that represents Ford Motor Co. in
its sponsorship of the Celtics _ a $250,000-per-year deal that
includes personal appearances by Pitino, but no direct fee for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone involved with Ford feels really good about spending
money with the team, in part because he is such a fine
ambassador,'' Meli said.
</P>
<P>
   As a pitchman for Citizens Bank, Pitino earns $250,000 per year,
Williams estimates. He is now in the third year of a five-year
contract. Citizens' commercials featuring Pitino air 12 to 15 times
a week, increasing to 20 when the Celtics are in town for a series
of home games, said Peter Joyce, vice president and brand director
of Citizens' advertising firm, Holland Mark Edmund Ingalls, in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As a commercial spokesman for Rodman Ford, of Hyde Park and
Norwood, Pitino earns another $75,000 to $100,000, Williams said.
The commercials appear most often on cable channels, especially
those featuring sports, said Dan Rodman, president of Rodman Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The coach is also an author.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's first motivational book, for Broadway Books/Random
House, topped The New York Times bestseller list for business books
for the entire month of March 1997. That means, for that month
alone, Pitino was earning about $3.50 per book on sales of at least
80,000 books, according to publishing industry sources. Spokeswomen
for Broadway Books would not reveal the total number of sales, but
the company claims at least 500,000 readers for the book,
co-written with a Providence Journal-Bulletin sports columnist,
Bill Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   A second motivational book _ its working title is ``Lead to
Succeed,'' Reynolds said _ is slated for publication in May, just
in time to be a gift idea for Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``The Rick Pitino Show'' on WBZ-TV. It airs at 11
a.m. on Sundays, when it has about a 3 rating _ meaning that it is
watched in about 190,000 households, or 8 percent of the homes
using television at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The rebroadcast of the show, at 12:30 a.m. on Monday, has about
a 3 rating and a 9 share.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said that Pitino is paid a flat fee for the
program and owns no production rights, including any opportunity to
benefit directly from the sale of advertising for the show. A
spokeswoman for WBZ-TV would not reveal any details about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also owns thoroughbred racehorses _ including the
fourth-place finisher in the 1998 Kentucky Derby, Halory Hunter.
Pitino purchased the horse for $135,000; it earned $713,120 in its
racing career and is now garnering stud fees.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if he needed more to do, Pitino is a purveyor of six
types of pasta, three sauces and two salsas. His income from
Louisville, Ky.-based Pitino Foods comes from an undisclosed
royalty that he is paid off the top, and from his take as a 25
percent shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   All of that money goes to the Daniel Pitino Foundation, a
charity named after his infant son who died in 1987 of congenital
conditions, said Salvatore Rubino, who helps run Pitino Foods. That
money is then disbursed, by Pitino, to various children's charities
in Massachusetts, including Children's Hospital and The Make a Wish
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   According to records in the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney
General, the Kentucky-based foundation received about $957,000 in
contributions and revenue in the year ending March 31 and
distributed about $466,000 to charities. It spent about $477,000 on
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   All of Pitino's side interests are in addition to serving full
time as both president and head coach of the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done very well, and it is his reputation as a coach and
the power of his personality that is driving all of this,'' said
Patrick McGee, a vice president at Octagon Athlete Representation
in Virginia. ``The guy is just a charismatic leader, and he has
been so great with underdogs throughout his career and bringing
teams back from bad times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch a game and you watch him and the way he coaches
and how much it all means to him and what he instills in those
guys, he makes you want to root for him,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   What companies like about Pitino _ and about coaches like
Parcells, Riley, and Jackson _ is that they are easily recognizable
symbols of both success and good management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If corporations are looking for spokespeople or motivational
speakers, they want to associate with a winner,'' said Peter Land,
general manager of the sports and entertainment marketing practice
at Edelman Public Relations Worldwide in New York. Land is also a
former director of marketing communications for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches also are people managers, and that's what we do in
business every day,'' Land said. ``Those successful NBA coaches
blend the skills of 12 individuals, hoping to come up with a
victorious result. It is not that different from any other
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino refuses to talk about all of the moonlighting _ at least
until after the basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season, as far as Rick is concerned, it is all
about basketball,'' said Jeff Twiss, the Celtics' spokesman.
``After the season, he'd be happy to talk about it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pitino _ the acclaimed communicator, who
preaches that doing it well is a key to success _ knows he should
not be talking about his nonbasketball business during the season,
especially when he is so far from accomplishing his goal of
bringing an NBA championship back to a storied franchise. His
instincts clearly tell him that it would only send the players, the
fans and his boss, Celtics owner Paul Gaston, the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   Some who are watching Pitino spin out his successes off the
court wonder when and if the on-the-court performance of the team _
which clearly is not at the top level _ will begin to affect his
ancillary ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, spokesmen for two major companies in Boston said that
after listening to pitches from Pitino, they decided not to hire
him to represent the companies. Both spokesmen requested anonymity
for themselves and their firms. ``We may not have been interested,
regardless, but three things have sort of come together to hurt him
_ the NBA strike, the poor performance of the team, and the fact
that he commands top dollar,'' said one of the spokesmen.

<P>
   Some coaches shun the extracurricular work until they get their
teams on the right track. McGee said his firm has tried to
encourage Washington Redskins coach Norv Turner to take advantage
of several business opportunties offered to him and to begin
cultivating others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't do it,'' McGee said. ``He says, `I can't really do
anything until I win. I don't want to be out in front of my players
making money before we have some success.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But other observers say that Pitino's record as a successful
coach _ and as a successful businessman _ was so well established
before he got to the Celtics that it makes little difference if the
team is losing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they say, it is acknowledged that the Celtics were in a
deep hole when the franchise hired Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anytime soon this guy's public image and
marketability are (going to be) diminished by the Celtics'
performance,'' Land said. ``From one year to the next in the NBA,
it is very difficult to have that kind of seismic transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all a long way from the early 1980s, when Pitino had an
apartment in Kenmore Square and walked to his job at Boston
University. He is not only a coach of considerable repute, whose
contract with the storied Celtics franchise rewrote the rules on
how much money NBA coaches are worth, but an accomplished
businessman, best-selling author, and speaker of national acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just love the guy,'' Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
   The auto dealership has an annual Ride for Kids, a bike tour
that last September raised $1.3 million for five agencies serving
youths in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him if he would help in any way, and he went way
beyond the call,'' Rodman said. ``He came to our breakfast and gave
a tremendous motivational speech about the importance of
cooperation and teamwork, and then he supported the event
financially with a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the few guys out there in sports that's still the
full package. When he does a deal with you, he supports you with
his time, energy and even money. He brings it all with him.''

FLORIDA PAIR TO PUT ON THE RITZ WITH $100,000 NEW YEAR'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE HATFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ She likes caviar and champagne, rubrum lilies, and
staying at the Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   He likes racing his antique cars around the world, waltz
evenings, dressing in black tie, and staying at the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   They are the kind of people you might expect to buy the hotel's
sole ``Ultimate Millennium Experience'' package for New Year's
weekend in Boston _ and they did, for a cool $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you might ask, would Wendy and Dean Edmonds leave their
lovely Florida home and fancy club to come north for what could be
one of the coldest weekends of the winter? ``The Ritz is an old
hangout from previous days,'' says Dean S. Edmonds Jr., a New York
native who attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and lived
here most years from 1943 to 1991, before retiring as a physics
professor at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up another reason to celebrate the change from 1999
to 2000, according to Edmonds, an aeronautics authority who writes
college physics texts. ``This is the first turn of the century in
400 years which happens to be a leap year,'' says Edmonds, 74,
whose father was a leading patent lawyer and prominent investor.
</P>
<P>
   A fine ballroom dancer, according to those who know him, the
younger Edmonds was a regular at Boston's waltz evenings and the
Consul's Ball during the years he lived and taught here. He is a
Gilbert and Sullivan aficionado. And he owns two airplanes, 14
cars, and a Type 55 Bugatti roadster that has won prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Edmonds, who met her husband during a party at a
Ritz-Carlton in Florida, says, ``I'm from Boston. I adore Boston
and have spent lots of time at the Ritz there. They do everything
so beautifully, and they're working with us in planning this
weekend so that it is going to be unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   She is the former Wendy Adams of Manchester, born in Cohasset,
the daughter of E. Carlton Nickerson of the Chatham and Orleans
Nickersons, and is a Mayflower descendant. The Barnstable campus of
Cape Cod Community College is about to be named Nickerson Campus
after her father.
</P>
<P>
   She learned how to race antique cars before she met her husband,
helped him restore their 1927 Bentley, and races with him in
Florida, Texas, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they'll get for $100,000 when they return for the
millennium:
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz celebration begins when the couple, who just celebrated
their sixth anniversary, are picked up at Logan Airport in a
chauffeur-driven Jaguar on the afternoon of Dec. 30 and brought to
the Presidential Suite, the hotel's premier room. The suite has its
own dining room and 24-hour private butler service.
</P>
<P>
   They won't need to carry a lot of luggage. His tails and dinner
jackets and her gowns (one of which is being made of cream-colored
duchesse satin in Florida and then flown to New York, where a
furrier will add a sable edge) will be sent ahead of time, pressed,
and settled into the closet of the Presidential Suite before the
couple's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the 30th, the Edmondses have asked six friends
to a special dinner in the Ritz wine cellar, the menu of which she
has been planning since July. ``I want very special wines,'' she
says, adding that one will be the great old French wine Petrus,
from Bordeaux. A violinist will entertain the diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be many courses,'' she says. ``I've thought about
having everything _ all the food _ be white. We had a dinner
similar to that in Venice with friends, and it was very nice. If we
don't have all white food, we will at least include white truffles
in the menu.'' They'll also have a private cocktail party for those
friends in their suite before going to the wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of New Year's Eve, they will enjoy breakfast in
bed and be treated to a massage as part of the package. ``I'll be
drinking champagne all day and will just enjoy having no `home
work,' which for me means organizing and running the . . . house
and gardening down there'' in Florida, says Wendy Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband will receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Chrono watch
with crocodile-skin strap and she a ladies' 18-karat gold Bulgari
Quadrato watch with Tubogas bracelet as part of the package.
They'll get a magnum of Taittinger champagne and two Baccarat
crystal flutes in a custom-designed gift box, in addition to a
photo album, engraved stationery, and Bulgari perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Before going downstairs to the Ritz grand ballroom to dine and
dance to the live music of Peter Duchin, the couple plan to jump
into the Jag and pop over to Brookline for the annual New Year's
Eve party given by a close friend from BU days, Howard B. Gottlieb,
founder and director of the university's Department of Special
Collections. Dean Edmonds is a director of the BU Library.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Edmonds will add a tiara to her cream-colored ensemble _
``Why not?'' she says. ``The Ritz always makes me feel cosseted,
like a queen.'' She has other gowns for the other two nights she'll
be at the Ritz, but for New Year's Eve, the skirt is full and the
ensemble will include a sable-trimmed matching cape.
</P>
<P>
   On the first morning of the year 2000, the Ritz will put on a
brunch for the Edmondses' extended family from the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a final private dinner in the Presidential Suite for
six more friends on Jan. 2. That dinner also will be black tie, and
the special Chateau Yquem will be one of the wines served. Wendy
has arranged for Gilbert and Sullivan entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Their limo will take them to the airport on Jan. 3 for the trip
back to Florida. ``I guess it was my idea to do this at first,''
says Wendy Edmonds. ``We usually travel to Europe each fall, and
then we usually spend New Year's Eve at our club in Florida. But I
said, for the millennium, let's go to the Ritz. They will fill our
room with flowers and candles, and they have been so fabulous about
planning this weekend. I don't think I could wish for anything
more. I guess you could call it `buying a memory.' ''

<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ James McGuirk remembers how he and other
neighborhood children would run after the fire engines that clanged
past their homes. He would scamper along proudly, point at the man
perched on the end of the ladder and shout, ``That's my Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk also recalls how he and other friends would gather at
the station in the city's Burncoat section, climb all over the fire
engines and slide down the fire pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firemen were heroes to us, just by being there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To McGuirk they were also family.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1942, when James's father, Francis A. McGuirk, grew weary
of his wire factory job and joined the Worcester Fire Department,
the McGuirks have carried on a proud tradition serving on the
firefighting force.
</P>
<P>
   Francis McGuirk's brother William joined after him. Then came
their sister Catherine's son, their sister Mary's son, their sister
Alice's son and two grandsons, and then William's son.
</P>
<P>
   Nine McGuirks in all have served, including Joseph T. McGuirk,
38, of Leicester, who died in the fire at the Worcester Cold
Storage and Warehouse Co. building Friday. The family has
collectively given more than 200 years of service to the
department.
</P>
<P>
   And they have suffered heavily for it.
</P>
<P>
   When Joseph McGuirk, affectionately known as Joey, perished in
the blaze that engulfed the warehouse, he became the fifth McGuirk
to die of fire-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The family was always aware of the risks of what they considered
an honorable calling. James McGuirk said his father tried not to
speak of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to worry us,'' said McGuirk, his eyes filling
with tears. ``But what happened to Joey is something we all grew up
with. We knew what the risks were.''
</P>
<P>
   In those early days, the work held even more peril. Until the
1970s, Worcester firefighters did not have individual air tanks to
protect them from the fumes. ``Firemen were smoke eaters,'' said
McGuirk, now 61, who heads the science department at South High
Community School.
</P>
<P>
   He said he watched his uncle, William T. McGuirk Sr., die of
fire-related damage to his heart and lungs. His own father and his
cousin Robert Johnson died of heart problems that were deemed to be
job-related. Another cousin, John McMahon, died from injuries
sustained on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job,'' said William T. McGuirk Jr., Joseph's
brother, who retired in 1985 after 20 years of service. ``But the
equipment's getting better all the time. And you help save a life,
save someone's property. It's very gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   There were McGuirks on the scene on March 3, 1946, when sheets
of flames, whipped by high winds, leapt 300 feet in the air from
the North Works warehouse of the American Steel and Wire Co. before
firefighters quelled the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirks battled in sweltering summer heat on July 12, 1960,
when fires raged out of control for four hours, gutting the Charles
Dowd Box Co. warehouse on Ludlow Street.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirks fought the tragic flash fire in the Indian Hill section
of Worcester in 1968, when five teenagers were trapped in their
clubhouse and died; and the inferno that destroyed two plastic
factories in Webster Square on May 4, 1977; and the arson blaze
that claimed seven lives on April 20, 1983, in the Central
Community House about two blocks north of Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The McGuirks came from Ireland, emigrating during the Great
Potato Famine of 1847. They began in eastern Canada and made their
way to Worcester in the 1880s, where they worked as tenant farmers
or factory workers in the wire mills.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGuirk came to Worcester as a child and married an
Irish immigrant, Annie Doyle. They had 14 children; nine survived.
Francis A. McGuirk was the only one of his siblings to get any
college education.
</P>
<P>
   He was a family leader. ``Everyone looked up to him,'' said his
son, James.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph T. McGuirk, who died in Friday's fire, was the most
recent member of the family to be inducted into the force, having
been sworn in two years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his relatives, he had always wanted to be a
firefighter and quickly bonded with the others in his unit, Engine
No. 3. ``He was very friendly, popular, and well-respected,'' said
Bernie Bastardo, 56, a fellow firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Bastardo remembered other McGuirk relatives, Joseph McGuirk's
cousins, who became firefighters: Robert Johnson, who served from
1949 to 1974, ``a very professional guy with a good sense of
humor,'' he said; and feisty John J. McMahon, who fought fires for
more than 35 years before his death in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew each other. We're all working-class people, all in
the same boat together. . . . We like going to work,'' Bastardo
said. ``And we're all hurting now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastardo was sitting with some of his comrades on a concrete
bunker Tuesday near the charred remains of the warehouse. Behind
them, a fire engine was festooned with wreaths, flowers, and notes
of gratitude for the six men who died.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were still sifting through the smoldering rubble, but
treacherous conditions continued to make their search difficult.
Only one body had been found.
</P>
<P>
   William T. McGuirk was standing near the fire engine, exhausted
by the vigil at the fire scene.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to speak for all the McGuirks when he reflected on
their firefighting tradition: ``It's in the bloodlines. It's in
this family,'' he said. ``It's a dedication, like a calling.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatigue and frustration of the search for his brother's body
were in his voice, and the sadness of yet another loss for a family
that has given so much for Worcester.

CHRISTIAN COALITION PONDERS WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition, once a powerful political and religious
force, is facing serious financial and organizational problems.
</P>
<P>
   The direct-mail fund-raiser for the coalition, which was once
the leading voice of the religious right, has sued the group for
nonpayment of bills, and the coalition's Washington lobbying chief
has quit.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in Alexandria, Va., Stephen Winchell and
Associates accused the coalition of failing to pay $400,000 in
bills even though the company helped raise $7 million for the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Randy Tate, the coalition's top Washington lobbyist
and its former executive director, has stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition spokesman Chris Freund insisted that the organization
was not in any serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we have some financial and other issues to deal
with,'' Freund said. ``But, again, we're quite confident we can.
We're looking forward to the new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate's departure, according to published reports, leaves very
few people in senior management position at the coalition's
Washington headquarters who were in those same posts a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition reorganized itself following an Internal Revenue
Service ruling that denied the group's tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Freund said the coalition's current debt was about $2 million,
which he said was ``manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some vendors we owe some money to, but we're working
out repayment schedules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After being founded by Pat Robertson in 1989, following his
unsuccessful presidential bid, the coalition reached its high point
in the mid-1990s when it was led by Ralph Reed, who left to become
a campaign adviser. The organization has struggled ever since.

   --The traditional view of family is threatened by ``narrow
individualism and ethical relativism,'' Pope John Paul II said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff warned of ``disastrous consequences'' if society
jettisons the view of family based on marriage between a man and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sectors of society question the very understanding of the
family as a stable community founded on marriage between a man and
a women,'' John Paul told about 7,000 people who attended his
weekly general audience at the Vatican. ``New definitions of
marriage and the family are being put forward which foster narrow
individualism and ethical relativism.''
</P>
<P>
   And he warned, ``Where the family gives way, society lacks its
connective tissue with disastrous consequences that attack people,
particularly the weakest, from children to adolescents to the
handicapped, the sick, and the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   --After several years of trying, the Swedish Church of
Scientology has persuaded that nation's government to grant the
church tax-exempt status.

A CLASH OF CLAIMS IN THE HOLY LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WADI KHARRAR, Jordan _ Five years ago, this was a front line in
the Arab-Israeli conflict _ a barren desert landscape interrupted
only by barbed wire, an infantry battalion's watchtower, and a
field of small flags marking land mines buried beneath the chalky
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   As troops redeployed after the peace agreement between Jordan
and Israel in 1994, a tank rolled over what appeared to be an
ancient foundation, and its treads revealed a mosaic tile floor.
</P>
<P>
   Following the chance find, Jordanian archeologist Mohammad
Waheeb waited for specialists to finish the tedious task of
clearing the land mines, then began his work. After two years of
studying biblical texts and dating archeological artifacts, Waheeb
concluded he had found the site where Jesus was baptized by John
the Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the Gospel According to John describes as
`Bethany beyond the Jordan,' '' said Waheeb, holding an open Bible
in one hand and a rolled map in the other as he squinted in the
early morning sun across the desert plain and toward the eastern
banks of the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very holy place. Can you feel it?'' he asked as a dry
wind rolled across the sands and the sun baked the desert expanse.
</P>
<P>
   His conclusions, which could prove to be some of the most
significant in biblical archeology in decades, have made this place
a front line once again: not a military front, but a forward
position in the battle between Israel and Jordan over tourists'
dollars _ potentially hundreds of millions of dollars _ as
Christian pilgrims flock to the Holy Land to retrace the path of
Jesus on the 2000th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Bank of the Jordan River, Israel also lays claim to
what it believes is the spot where Jesus was baptized, at a place
at the mouth of the Jordan not far from Jericho, a location that
Israeli maps refer to as ``Kasser-el-Yahud'' _ ``Fortress of the
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The rival claims represent a classic Holy Land struggle _ one in
which the Jewish state and a neighboring Muslim kingdom squabble
over a sacred Christian site.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Aqel Biltaji,
quipped, ``If people want to go to the West Bank of the Jordan
River, we are not going to stop them. We are just saying they are
in the wrong place.''
</P>
<P>
   And Israel's Uri Mor, director of the division of Christian
communities in the Ministry of Religious Affairs, responded, ``How
do they know he (John the Baptist) lived there? Do they have any
proof? Pilgrims have been coming to the site at Kasser-el-Yahud for
years now, and they're used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bickering can leave even the most faithful feeling cynical
about the millennial hype around the 3 to 4 million tourists
expected to come to the Holy Land over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this has become about the crass materialism of
the tourist trade,'' said Father Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, a
Dominican priest and renowned biblical historian who has lived in
Jerusalem for 30 years. ``The thing to remember is the spirituality
a Christian believer could feel on either side of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan, which flows south from Mount Hermon to the Sea of
Galilee, becomes a slow, winding, olive-colored stream before it
empties into the Dead Sea at 1,300 feet below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   On the Jordanian side, about two miles east from where it feeds
into the Dead Sea, a small hill overlooks a thin patch of reeds
around a natural spring. Here, Waheeb, working with 20
archeologists and 100 laborers, has unearthed the stone foundations
of three early Christian monasteries, a chapel, and three pools
used to collect water from the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the type of ceramic material used in an aqueduct
leading to one of the pools and the mortar used in construction of
one monastery, Waheeb believes the structures could date as far
back as the third century A.D. Waheeb says he has also found coins
and pottery that date to the first century, at about the time that
John the Baptist was ``a voice in the wilderness,'' as scripture
tells it, performing his ministry in this remote desert outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian government has spent $1 million on excavating the
site and is now investing a further $6 million, most of it coming
from the US Agency for International Development, to develop it for
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   With the clearing of land mines in the final stage, Jordan hopes
to turn this sand-blown, fly-infested, arid land into a tourist
mecca. There are plans for hotels, a visitors center, a John the
Baptist Research Center, and baptismal pools for the ritual
anointing of Christian pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope to open the site, which is today still a closed
military area, to tourism by March, when the Pope is expected to
tour the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious tourism depends on religious sites, and we have just
added one of the most sacred sites in Christianity,'' boasted
Beltaji from his office at Jordan's Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   One American official in Jordan, who asked not to be identified,
expressed some skepticism about the project, calling the archeology
``a Toys-R-Us operation'' and suggesting that the plans for
development were grandiose. But Beltaji is a believer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are blessed in this land to have been visited by the
prophets of the Bible, including John the Baptist. And we eagerly
want to share that with the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Jordan may have a strong emerging market here is that
Israel has not been so eager to share its site.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel captured the area from Jordan in 1967, frequent
cross-border attacks and terrorism led the Israelis to restrict
access. It is still a declared ``military area'' in which Christian
churches are permitted to hold pilgrimages and prayer services only
three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1967 war, tens of thousands of Orthodox Christians
from the West Bank and Jerusalem would flock to the river bank
during holy days on traditional pilgrimages that went back at least
1,000 years. There are monasteries and chapels there built on
foundations dating back to the fourth and fifth centuries, which
have been built and rebuilt as a result of earthquakes and wars.
</P>
<P>
   But Biblical historians say the tradition of pilgrimages on the
west side grew up as a matter of convenience. Most pilgrims came
from Jerusalem, and it was easier to observe the baptism site from
the west than to hire a boat to cross the river.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of Jordan's aggressive plans to promote its
site, Israel is now planning to open the Kasser-el-Yehud site for
expanded tourism. Israeli officials have been quoted in local
newspapers as saying that by next year as many as 10 buses a day
would be permitted to the site, which is currently flanked by
barbed wire fencing that reads ``Land mines: Danger.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, in response to Christian complaints about the
restrictions on access to Kasser-el-Yahud, Israel opened a tourist
center at Kibbutz Kinneret, where the Jordan flows out of the Sea
of Galilee. Although it is some 65 miles north of the actual site,
the kibbutz has done a booming business. Tourists from America and
Europe come in sandals and sun hats and fill up soda bottles with
river water they consider holy.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that biblical archaelogy can be more
of an interpretive art than a science, especially in a part of the
world where earthquakes, war, and the shifting sands of time have
endlessly altered the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Still, archeological experts who have visited the Jordanian site
say the findings at Wadi Kharrar are solid. And Jordanian scholars'
reading of scripture is sound in that the gospels place Jesus on
the east side of the Jordan before he was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very intriguing findings,'' said Rev. Eugenio
Alliata, an archeologist with the Roman Catholic Order of
Franciscans, which has custody of holy sites. The foundations at
Wadi Kharrar ``certainly date back at least to the fifth century,
and there is a strong basis of fact to say that John the Baptist
would have used this site for baptisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliata described the finding as one of the most significant
since the discovery in 1968 of the house of St. Peter on the banks
of the Galilee in Caperneum.
</P>
<P>
   But Alliata said that even though John the Baptist may have
worked on the east bank of the Jordan River, the gospels place
Jesus' baptism in the River Jordan itself, not at the spring where
Jordanian archeologists and officials claim it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these locations are very close to each other and can be
placed within a high degree of certainty within a mile or so,''
said Alliata.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth,'' he added, is that ``observing the spot where
Jesus Christ was baptized can be done from the east or the west. It
doesn't matter which side of the river you are on.''

INDEPENDENT VOTERS CALL THE SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Only four of the eight surviving
presidential candidacies count for much.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I do solemnly swear . . .'' survivor will be named Bush,
Gore, Bradley or McCain. Steve Forbes will be no more than a
factor, and he'll only factor into the outcome if he tries to take
down either Governor George W. Bush of Texas or Senator John McCain
of Arizona with negative TV ack-ack, and then it will probably
benefit the one he does not attack.
</P>
<P>
   There is a different feel on the ground now, seven weeks out
from the first primary. The rumble of tank treads is in the air.
The ground games of the Gore and Bush operations, spearheaded by
the organization of Governor Jeanne Shaheen in the Democrat's case
and the organization of Senator Judd Gregg in Bush's, are coming
into play.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet has a handle on how the bounce out of the Iowa
caucuses the night of Feb. 24 will spin into the two Feb. 1 Granite
State primaries. Nor does any pollster or pundit have a firm grasp
of the biggest variable in New Hampshire: Where do the independent
voters go, the ``unenrolled'' folks who number around 270,000 by
recent count _ more than who sign up to register in either party.
</P>
<P>
   The unenrolled can walk into the polling station and vote in
either primary; a voter registered as Republican or Democrat
cannot. How does this setup play this year? We have in essence the
``third primary'' here, the race for the independent vote, and that
appears to be between Republican McCain, the hot-as-a-pistol
campaigner, and Bill Bradley, the laconic Democrat whose dark-horse
candidacy flourished here as nowhere else, giving the former New
Jersey senator at one point last month an 11-percent lead over Gore
in the vice president's own polling of most likely Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins that ``third primary'' _ McCain or Bradley _
affects the outcome in the other two, perhaps even determining the
ultimate victor whose face will pop up on the news magazines the
weekend after. So who benefits?
</P>
<P>
   --The better McCain does, the better it goes for Al Gore. New
Hampshire's track record is that front-running Democrats _ and Gore
is the front-runner outside of the Northeast _ do better when there
is a spirited fight on the GOP side. Gary Hart's clobbering of
Walter Mondale in '84 (with Shaheen piloting the Hart insurgency)
was enabled by lack of a GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   --The better Bush does, the more it helps Bradley. If the old
basketeer doesn't win here, after being ahead, where does he win?
Front-runners can stumble and recover down the primary road. But
dark horses expire in the snowbanks of the White Mountains, and
they don't drag out the carcass till spring.
</P>
<P>
   --For all of the calendar-juggling by the other states that
moved up primary dates to wrest away some of New Hampshire's
legendary clout on the nominating process, the net effect has been
to magnify, not diminish, the significance and import of Iowa's
caucuses and New Hampshire's primary. The second primary comes in
South Carolina Feb. 19, with Bush way ahead there, and then Arizona
is third on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken New Hampshire from a regional to a Final Four
event,'' chortles Tom Rath, a college basketball fan and GOP
national committeeman from New Hampshire who is with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bush camp has piled more chips onto the New Hampshire slot
on the nomination roulette wheel for several reasons: Bush's
handlers see a chance to kill off McCain, their only serious
challenger, in the opening round; McCain's surge here seems to have
unnerved the Bush insiders; Bush is untested in national elections,
and despite all the money and endorsements, it can get lonely out
there in front of the TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   So the quicker they nail this down, the less chance there is for
their man to implode. So far, in two TV debates, Bush has been
underwhelming. More critics are commenting on his Robot Boy act,
parroting scripted lines. His ``if Texas were a separate country it
would have the world's 11th-largest economy'' bit should lead to a
``Saturday Night Live skit.''
</P>
<P>
   --The large field format on the GOP side has benefited Bush. His
inadequacies as a front-line candidate are easier to conceal in a
crowd. A lengthy war of attrition against a feisty guy like McCain,
who seems energized by the fray, might expose more cracks in the
Bush facade. McCain just released his medical records, showing his
IQ measured at 128 and 133 in two tests. Does anyone think Bush
will do the same? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's perfunctory debate skills may not derail his awesomely
financed candidacy. But each time they're on the same show, Bush
suffers by comparison. All he seems to know is Texas. By contrast,
the hottest commodity is McCain, with his flat-out populist
approach. The Arizonan's latest TV spot, vowing to blow up the
congressional pork barrel, plays well with New Hampshire's quirky
independents.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire can shut the door on this campaign in both parties
if Bush and Gore win big. But if New Hampshire's maverick
independents find McCain to their taste, he lives to fight another
day.

GEORGE WASHINGTON'S EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He went riding during a December snowfall, developed a sore
throat and died two days later at his Mount Vernon estate. Two
centuries after his death, American conservatives can claim George
Washington, mostly because liberals are still stuck in 1960s
pacificism.
</P>
<P>
   Political wars over his legacy were as intense as those over his
graven image. A 1772 portrait by Charles Wilson Peale is both more
soldierly and more humane than the unfinished Gilbert Stuart
portrait of Washington sternly pondering his toothache, so familiar
on dollar bills and February auto sales. This is the ``Athenaeum
portrait,'' named after the Boston institution that owned it.
Painted in 1796, it seems unfinished because the artist was still
selling copies before delivering the final product to Martha
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another Boston institution, the Old North Church, has owned
since 1817 a bust that shows the general apparently without his
irksome choppers. In 1824, when the Marquis de Lafayette visited
the church, he remarked, ``Yes, that is the man I know and more
like him than any other portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, 67, died Dec. 14, 1799, some 45 years before the
invention of the telegraph. News traveled slowly then, gathering
the majestic moss of myth and legend. Geographer Allan R. Pred , in
``Urban Growth and the Circulation of Information,'' charted how
long it took for the news of Washington's death to reach the
frontiers of the new nation he heled build: a week to reach New
York, 11 days to Boston, 19 days to Kentucky, and 24 days to
western Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He took no salary as commanding general of the revolutionary
forces or as president. He shunned all royal trappings, which only
increased his popularity. His successor as president and skeptical
admirer was calm in his appraisal. ``Instead of adoring Washington,
mankind should applaud the nation which educated him,'' John Adams
said in 1785. ``I glory in the character of a Washington, because I
know him to be only an exemplification of the American character.''
</P>
<P>
   A plaster-saint depiction by Mason Locke Weems, an Episcopal
parson, infantilized the life of Washington into a mush of copybook
maxims and chopped-down cherry tree. By the 1960s, such caricatures
enraged the history-is-bunk brigades and quarantined Washington
from liberal approval.
</P>
<P>
   When the tall Virginian confronted skeptical New England troops
at Cambridge Common in July of 1775, he could have been taking
command of Woodstock Nation. He saw, he said, ``a mixed multitude
of people . . . under very little discipline, order, or
government.''
</P>
<P>
   By next March 17, after Henry Knox transported the cannons of
Fort Ticonderoga 300 snowy miles, Washington trained the captured
weapons on the British fleet and liberated Boston
</P>
<P>
   He was not a notably successful general, unlike U.S. Grant or
George S. Patton. But he stood for the superiority of civilian
rule, which alone should endear him to liberals. His Farewell
Address condemned ``those overgrown military establishments which,
under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty.''
Another old soldier, Dwight D. Eisenhower, echoed this warning in
his own farewell in 1960, coining ``the military-industrial
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Vietnam hangover finally subsides, Washington may
become a liberal hero again. In the meantime, conservative scholars
assess him with varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Richard Norton Smith, who has been director of both the
Herbert Hoover and the Gerald R. Ford presidential libraries,
published ``Patriarch,'' which focused on the nation's first
presidency, on ``George Washington under political, not military
siege,'' when the old general ``sparked more awe than affection.''
Smith concedes that ``George Washington is out of fashion, too
remote in time and temperament, too encased in marbled veneration,
to engage our emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Richard Brookhiser, an editor of National Review,
confidently wrote ``a moral biography, in the tradition of
Plutarch,'' whom, he notes, ``was very popular with 18th century
Americans; they knew something about the power of example that we
have forgotten. When he lived, Washington had the ability to give
strength to debates and to dying men. His life still has the power
to inspire anyone who studies it.''

THE NOT-SO-SUPERMARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve McQueen was lucky. He fought the Blob only in a movie. We
are attacked on every trip to the supermarket. The oozing monster
in McQueen's 1958 movie has been likened to a scary cherry Jell-O.
Today, the Jell-O is still coming for you in the baking aisle.
Aiieeee! You turn. You run. You make it to the corner into the next
aisle. You think you have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   But noooooo! You turn the corner only to see an avalanche of
corn chips and potato chips cascading off the shelves. Eeeeeek! You
turn. You run for the next aisle. You think you are safe. But
noooooo! You turn into the next aisle only to stare up at a
oncoming tidal wave of soda pop. You scream. You turn. You run for
your life. You flee for the fruits, vegetable, and tofu. You are
bawling in the fetal position, partially out of fear, and partially
because you hid behind the onions.
</P>
<P>
   You stay until you think the Blob has passed. Whimpering,
shaking uncontrollably, and crouched down on all fours, you inch
toward the checkout counter. You make it. You think . . .
</P>
<P>
   Noooooo! Just as you go ``Whew,'' you hear an ominous rumble.
You were so focused on the checkout counter, you did not see the
brick wall of candy collapsing on you. You look up, but now you are
too weak. You cannot scream. You cannot turn. You cannot run. You
are buried. You are engulfed.
</P>
<P>
   You become the Blob itself.
</P>
<P>
   We will not kill the Blob until we blow up the supermarket.
After new studies that found over 50 percent of US adults to be
overweight, Jeffrey Koplan, director of the Centers for Disease
Control, proclaimed obesity an ``epidemic.'' Part of the reason, he
said, was ``the availability of more food and foods with higher
energy content, the growth of the fast-food industry, the increased
numbers and marketing of snack foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are such foods more available than at the supermarket.
The United States produces enough ``food'' to jam 3,800 calories a
day into every American (which really means more since tiny
children don't need that many). This is up from 3,300 calories per
person, per day in 1970. The average man and woman need only 2,500
and 2,000 calories a day, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Most nutritionists say the rise in calories comes mostly from
junk foods. The food pyramids put out by the government urge us to
eat mostly grains, fruits, and vegetables and a moderate amount of
meat, fish, and dairy. As for fats, oils and sweets, the advice is
to ``use sparingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket uses a perverted inverted pyramid. Around
Boston, I paced a Star Market in Cambridge, a Stop &AMP; Shop in
Lexington, and the Washington Park Supermarket in Roxbury. Using my
normal gait (I figured a tape measure would attract attention), I
measured the aisles of allegedly edible products in footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   All the stores, whether working class or wealthy, were houses of
nutritional horrors. On average, 33 percent of the shelves were
loaded with the empty calories of sugar drinks, chips, candy, and
desserts. This was nearly twice the space for fruits and vegetables
(18 percent), three times the space for meat and seafood (10
percent) and six times the space for non-caloric items such as
coffee, tea, spices, and water (5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   This is conservative, excluding the galling aisle of sugar
cereals, since a lightweight argument could be made that you can
find a couple of grains and vitamins under the snowpack of sugar. A
box of Cocoa Krispies takes such liberties, as it features
basketball star Grant Hill holding up the food pyramid. The pyramid
says to eat sweets sparingly. The second ingredient in Cocoa
Krispies is sugar.
</P>
<P>
   This is perplexing. No one holds a gun to your head to go to
McDonald's. But unless you have a year-round hothouse,
slaughterhouse, and a thresher in the backyard, and a couple of
Guernseys in your cellar, you do have to go to a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets are not passive places. Unpackaged, unloved, and
monotonous walls of green vegetables compete with trash packaged in
circus colors to convince us to eat every last one of those 3,800
calories. The 1998 spending on advertising in the United States by
Hershey, Mars, Coke, and Pepsi (Pepsi sells Lay's and Doritos
chips) was $3 billion. That would fund the Boston public schools
for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Again, you might say, no one forced you to throw that Reese's
into the cart. But a study published this year by researchers at
the University of Wisconsin and the University of California at
Berkeley found that impulse buying accounts for 68 percent of
purchases at supermarkets and mass merchandisers.
</P>
<P>
   The supermarkets exploit this by placing the trash everywhere.
You never see brussel sprouts in aisles for Jell-O, but you find
candy hanging over vegetables, soda with fresh fruit, cookies next
to meat, and pastries next to the seafood.
</P>
<P>
   The government's pyramid has no chance against this disaster.
One of every three feet of the shelves tempt you with trash.
Temptation means certain capture. Empty calories go in, pounds ooze
onto our bellies. Until we change this, the terror continues. In
1958, the Blob was an alien. Today, it is us.

BOMBAY: My son uses WordPerfect 5.2. He saved his letters and notes

<P>
   Normally I don't like to hand out information that could be used
for anything other than benevolent purposes, unless, of course,
it's part of some practical joke that will make somebody look
really, really stupid. But maybe if I tell you how to break back
into your own documents, other people will realize how silly it is
to try to protect anything with a password as long as there are
legions of four-eyed, dateless geeks out there spending every
waking hour cracking every password they come across.
</P>
<P>
   Just go to Yahoo! and search for ``wpcrack'' or ``wpuncryp,''
and you'll find dozens of pages full of cracking tools for almost
every popular application. How secure do you you feel now?
Remember, the only totally protected document is the one on the

   DEAR BOBLESS: You're just lucky I'm not going to take a cheap
shot. Well, maybe I spoke too soon. Bob was Microsoft's goofy
attempt to dumb down Windows with a warm-and-fuzzy user interface.
It installed on top of Windows, turning a $3,000 investment in
computing horsepower into something that looked like it was made by
Playskool. Bob was slow, cranky and bug-riddled, and, as a
graphical interface, it made an excellent Frisbee. In fact, I had a
copy up until a few weeks ago when I needed something to fling at
the neighbor's toy poodle.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this was not one of Microsoft's shining moments,
and it's doubtful you'll find a copy at any retailer. Try computer
swap meets or post a query in some of the Microsoft newsgroups on
the Net. If nothing else, it'll give people a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay says he recently supersized a meal he
obtained from the former Bob project manager, but we think he's
exaggerating again. Bob aficionados may complain to

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Mass. _ Before the invention of the periodic table in
1869, chemists struggled to put elements like hydrogen and lithium
into a coherent classification scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Today, parts of the field of computer science now seem stuck
with the same lack of organization. In particular there is little
agreement among software security specialists on just how to
classify the sections of computer code that are often targeted by
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Government and academic groups have attempted to categorize
these software Achilles' heels for years, to little commercial
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But now some steam is gathering behind a project run by
Bedford-based Mitre Corp. to create a simpler listing of
weaknesses. The project doesn't try to classify codes and other
security problems into families or types, but only to list them as
part of what Mitre calls a directory of ``Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures.''
</P>
<P>
   By dumbing down its directory, known as the CVE, Mitre has
persuaded 23 organizations including Cisco Systems Inc. and IBM
Corp. to participate. The result can be found on line at
www.cve.mitre.org, and executives hope it will help standardize
terms and set a common vocabulary for building more secure systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the approach we've taken is to avoid everybody
arguing'' about complicated categorizations, said Steven Christey,
a software engineer at Mitre, a nonprofit government contractor.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague David Mann compares the CVE to the lists of
individual elements that were drawn up long before the periodic
table was accepted. ``To get things going scientifically we really
need to start small,'' Mann said. ``Hopefully it will spawn more
categorizations, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   While software viruses are quickly studied and named, the
security weaknesses they attack vary widely and are far more
difficult to classify.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the various names given for a type of code used by many
Web sites known as the ``common gateway interface,'' or cgi,
generally used to connect the site to on-line sources such as
telephone directories.
</P>
<P>
   Altering such code can cause big disruptions to the sites, a
weakness known as ``CA-96.06.cgi_example
</P>
<P>
   code'' by CERT, a well-known computer-security center at
Carnegie Mellon University. Meanwhile CyberSafe Corp., an Internet
security firm based in Issaquah, Wash., discusses the same weakness
as an ``HTTP `phf' Attack.''
</P>
<P>
   While both continue to use those names, they also have begun to
include in their advisories the name chosen by Mitre for the
condition: ``CVE-1999-0067,'' meaning that the problem was the 67th
identified under the CVE effort this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually they might drop their own terminologies altogether,
said Bill Fithen, a CERT security analyst. ``If CVE catches on,
there might truly be no legitimate reason to continue'' using older
names, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mitre, CVE represents a chance to show off the commerical
benefits of its work for government agencies. Founded in 1958 by a
group of researchers formerly associated with MIT's Lincoln
Laboratories, Mitre has chiefly been known as a contractor on
aerospace and classified military projects, with offices from Fort
Leavenworth, Kan., and Washington, D.C., to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has branched out into the civilian sector and
now runs research centers for the Federal Aviation Administration
and the Internal Revenue Service. In 1996 Mitre spun off divisions
that did research in space, environment, and telecommunications. It
still has about 4,000 employees worldwide and reported revenue of
$542 million for its latest fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the Pentagon, Mitre three years ago began
research in areas of ``critical infrastructure protection''; 15 of
the company's employees now are involved in a FBI anti-hacking
center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The CVE is rooted in such work, dreamed up by Mann after he was
assigned last year to create a database to protect the company's
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Mann wanted his computers to automatically compare alerts issued
by CERT and other security groups with an analysis of traffic on
Mitre's computers, but Mitre's programmers were using different
terms. ``I realized we needed a way to put these things together,''
said Mann, 37, who holds a doctorate in mathematics and once taught
at a US Navy postgraduate program in California.
</P>
<P>
   Mann developed the idea with Christey, 32, a senior software
engineer, and last January they presented a paper at a conference
at Purdue University in Indiana, sparking broader commercial
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Now many attendees of that conference are members of CVE's
25-member editorial board made up of software vendors, analysts,
and academics, and headed by Christey. So far the group has agreed
to assign numbers to about 320 vulnerabilities, and hopes to get to
665 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like many business consortiums, the CVE board also includes
members who aren't so enthusiastic. Some worry their competitors
will learn their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``CVE will only contain vulnerabilities that are old or not
interesting,'' said Marcus Ranum, chief executive of closely held
Network Flight Recorder in Woodbine, Md. To monitor possible
breakthroughs Ranum has assigned an employee to join the CVE board,
which holds conference calls periodically to discuss new entries.
But the board member won't give away too much, Ranum says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts me in a delicate spot as a vendor,'' he said. ``If I
were going to make CVE useful I'd give all my information to CVE.
But then my competitors would have it and my shareholders would
kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   But other CVE participants say they hope the list will demystify
their work to corporate customers and boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally people can get pretty confused when you try to sell
them software,'' said Andre Frech, a researcher at Internet
Security Systems in Atlanta, which recently began including CVE
numbers in a detection database.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Security Systems' founder, Christopher Klaus, says the
CVE might someday even become the basis of ``hacker insurance''
policies for companies to minimize the impact of technical
disruptions. Without CVE or something like it, he said, ``it would
be hard even to set the premiums . . . because people couldn't be
specific enough about what they might be selling.''
</P>
<P>
   If CVE catches on, it will please specialists who have tried to
develop more complex classification schemes with little notice,
like Eugene Spafford, a computer scientist at Purdue who ran the
conference where Mann and Christey first presented their paper.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Spafford began building his own open database of
computer security flaws, but found few companies could agree on
organizing criteria. In contrast, he said, CVE has already achieved
``a lot more buy-in than has happened in the past.''

NEXT BIG THING PUTS THE WEB ON YOUR PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if you didn't want it to, the Internet has quickly become a
bigger part of our business, social, and shopping lives than we
ever imagined it might.
</P>
<P>
   The next big Net thing is widely expected to be the growing use
of wireless telephones to connect to the World Wide Web, not just
by plugging the phone into your portable computer, but literally by
using the phone as a Web-surfing and e-mail collecting device.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, I expect and hope I will be able to tell my
disbelieving grandchildren that I was there for the gramophone era
of wireless Web access, when we had all of about 100 picture-free
sites to surf, screens of barely 40 letters, and had to ``dial''
e-mail over the number keypad.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks I had a chance to get paid to play with the new
wireless Web phones now being heavily promoted in the Greater
Boston market by Bell Atlantic Mobile and Sprint PCS. (Some other
local carriers, particularly Omnipoint, have some similar services
or are rolling them out soon, but it seems objective to say that
Bell and Sprint are hawking them most aggressively, just as the
holiday shopping season arrives.)
</P>
<P>
   Creeping onto the Southeast Expressway one afternoon, I
downloaded the latest New York Times Co. stock quote. Standing
outside the Kendall Square T stop, I sent my editors an e-mail
straight from the phone assuring them I was ``working.''
</P>
<P>
   I searched a reverse telephone directory to find out who had
left me a page. I got a five-day weather forecast for Cape Cod to
see if it might be a nice weekend to visit. I checked with Delta
Air Lines to see whether my mother-in-law's flight home from a
visit would leave on time. Sadly, there was no hope she would get
to stay with us longer.
</P>
<P>
   And finding myself in Harvard Square one morning, I even got the
phone to give me directions for driving all the way to my in-laws'
home in Atlanta. I got pretty accurate and sensible step-by-step
directions, including, south of Richmond, ``bear right on ramp to
I-85 and go southwest for 492.2 miles,'' although they gave me a
wrong turn once I got a quarter-mile from my wife's family's house.
</P>
<P>
   While there are obvious shortcomings and gaps and it is a big
pain to have to type in 22 666 777 8 666 66 to spell ``Boston,'' my
road tests with Sprint PCS Wireless Web and Bell Atlantic Mobile
Web Access convinced me that, as William Shatner might say, this is
going to be big. Really big.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most indications are that wireless data is going to
explode. By early 2002, the Yankee Group in Boston predicts, there
could be 25 million wireless data users nationwide. By 2003, other
industry officials see 600 million Web-browsing wireless phones in
operation around the world, their users spending $33.5 billion
annually for the service.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, the Yankee Group estimates, 30 percent
of big North American corporations will be providing employees
wireless access to their Intranets, internal information and e-mail
networks.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason is the growing availability of digital wireless
networks that provide much more reliable connections than the old
analog systems, on which various attempts were made to add data
capability with spotty success. ``Wireless Internet, after 10 years
of fits and starts, is finally getting ready for prime time,'' said
Sprint's Rick Pearl.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Bell Atlantic and Sprint think that, for now,
their biggest market will be selling the phones as modems for
laptop computer owners to get access from anywhere to the World
Wide Web or their electronic mail. To do so, you need to buy an $80
or $100 cable and spend a few minutes configuring your laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the best you can do over a wireless phone is a
download speed of 14.4 kilobits per second, which is pretty
torturous for Web surfing but adequate for collecting and sending
e-mail. And it sure beats 0 kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   But I was considerably more curious about what you can do just
using the phone itself. The happily surprising answer: a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I did was to ignore the instruction manuals and
see how inherently intuitive the Qualcomm phones are to use. Both
passed the test handily. In seconds, moving up and down buttons and
entering numbers, I was reading e-mails I had asked my siblings to
send me, scrolling through the latest national news headlines, and
making an inventory of where to get my horoscope and Boston Bruins
scores.
</P>
<P>
   As a fan of $9 date books and 30-cent pens, I have never quite
grasped the point of personal digital assistants. But devotees may
be pleased to know Web-equipped wireless phones generally include
schedulers, address books, and organizers that send you a chirpy
alarm when an appointment is about to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bell and Sprint connect to specially designed Web sites
that are written in what is called HDML, handheld device markup
language. Basically, it is an extremely bare-bones system that
gives you no pictures, just things including news briefs, weather
forecasts, and answers to questions such as what is the current
price of a stock and what is the weather in a given ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   While it's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg question _ which
comes first, more wireless Web sites or more wireless Web users _
it seems easy to believe that within months, hundreds of HDML sites
will be popping up every week.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which offers access to an (at)SprintPCS site and a
Yahoo! site from the phone, has built-in space for a future
wireless Web portal, a shopping site, and a ``community news'' site
targeted at different groups of people.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to imagine banks adding services so that you can use
the phone to get balances or transfer money between accounts, or
Amtrak or airlines letting you buy a ticket over the phone, or
hotel chains allowing you to reserve rooms by entering a
destination ZIP code and credit-card number.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious question is whether the existing services are really
worth the roughly $100 up-front cost of getting a Web-ready phone,
plus a bigger calling plan to handle time spent on Web surfing and
e-mail or a $10 monthly add-on to pay for data access.
</P>
<P>
   Given the painfully slow method of composing outgoing e-mail,
spelling out letters by pressing each number one to four times
while you eat up your monthly minute allotment, it also seems
profligate, but fun, to use the phone to send e-mail when you could
just call the person. (Nokia and Ericsson make phones with tiny
keyboards on the back; these are just starting to become available
in this country and could make e-mail from the phone vastly easier
and more popular.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to spend too much time on cool for cool's
sake,'' said Larry McDonnell, Sprint's northeast public relations
director. ``It's got to be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also some birth-pang glitches here and there. When I
asked Bell Atlantic Mobile for a weather forecast for the 02459 ZIP
code, it gave me five choices: Newton, Newton Center, Newton
Centre, Newton Ctr and Newton Cntr. Then on a Monday, the five-day
forecast was for the period beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the eight destinations on the Sprint PCS home page are
``coming soon.'' Go to the help menu on the BAM phone, and it
warns, ``No help available here.'' Sending e-mail from the Bell
Atlantic Mobile phone is far easier than from the Sprint phone,
which requires you to set up a My Yahoo account.
</P>
<P>
   But these are all whiny nitpicks. We need to focus on the bold,
liberating future promised to humankind by wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of equal time, we should mention what other
carriers have or plan to offer:
</P>
<P>
   --AT&AMP;T Wireless announced earlier this month that this winter it
will begin selling two phones with access to ABC and Bloomberg
News, ESPN scores, and the Infospace telephone directories.
</P>
<P>
   --Cellular One last week announced a $10-a-month, strictly
one-way service that delivers to your phone preselected news
headlines, weather forecasts, sports, lottery results, stock
quotes, and soap opera updates. It is basically a souped-up version
of the information some paging companies will now deliver to your
beeper. It will offer Web surfing and e-mail here early next year,
according to company spokeswoman Marcia Schiavoni.
</P>
<P>
   --Nextel, which is best known for phones with two-way radio
capabilities popular with tradespeople and fleet drivers, will
unveil its data network in Greater Boston ``sometime in 2000,''
according to company spokesman John Redman. ``We want to have ours
completely ready.''
</P>
<P>
   --Omnipoint, whose American networks use the same GSM system
that dominates in Europe, making it popular with business people
who want to use the same phone on both sides of the Atlantic, gives
access to weather, stocks, horoscopes, and other information, plus
e-mail sent to (the phone number)(at)omnipoint.net.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint is also testing, in New York, a new system called
General Packet Radio Service that should allow download speeds of
1.5 megabits per second, comparable to cable modems or Digital
Subscriber Lines. This service, Olson said, may become available in
Boston within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Added Olson, ``Wireless Internet access is huge, and it's
certainly where we think the future lies.''

 &HT;    Love to buy, hate to wrap? Let someone else take over
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deck the halls, trim the tree, shop till you drop and
then sit back and enjoy all that the holiday season has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Don't put your feet up and start sipping that eggnog just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more monumental chore to undertake, and it's one
most of us dread about as much as opening those credit card bills
in January: wrapping all the loot.
</P>
<P>
   You can take the Martha Stewart approach and dig out the glue
gun, brandish enough gold paint to gild the neighborhood and even
print your own wrapping paper. Or you can let someone else's nimble
fingers do the cutting, folding and taping for you.
</P>
<P>
   Most large department stores offer gift-wrapping services. Of
course, it's a hassle to stand in line with an armful of robes,
shirts and Uncle Buddy's favorite brand of gym socks. However, many
places will let you drop off the gifts and return for them later.
Remember, you'll pay for a wrap job, unless you have a preferred
customer card, which some major stores offer to their most prized
credit customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many boutiques and gift shops offer free gift wrapping and a few
already have selected items prewrapped _ as do the big department
stores. Some stores that don't offer gift wrapping provide
complimentary signature boxes that don't need any embellishment.
For instance, Nordstrom's elegant metallic boxes are almost as
welcome as the gifts they contain.
</P>
<P>
   And who wouldn't love to find a sky blue Tiffany &AMP; Co. box tied
with a festive ribbon under the tree? No need to sully that
surprise with Santa paper.
</P>
<P>
   Most stores will only handle merchandise bought from them.
However, places like Wrapsody _ which has kiosks at various metro
Atlanta malls _ will wrap anything from anywhere. And you can leave
a batch of presents to be wrapped, shop a bit more, then pick them
up.
</P>
<P>
   There is a middle ground for those who don't want to do their
own wrapping and yet refuse to stand in line. JC Penney sells
prewrapped boxes that include tissue and a bow. Martha Stewart
might not approve, but it's a quick and easy alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some local wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   Pro wrapper favors simple, elegant
</P>
<P>
   For Margie Perry, gift wrapping is an art form.
</P>
<P>
   The professional wrapper (left) has been wrapping gifts at
Rich's for 26 years, and last year she won a $500 consolation prize
in the 3M Scotch Tape wrapping contest in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes, patience and skill; tender loving care,'' said
Perry, who works at Rich's Greenbriar store in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expressions of joy you see on the faces of customers when
they see the wrapped package makes me feel good. I like beautiful
things, and gift wrap is both a reflection and an expression of who
I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry shares these tips for wrapping the perfect package:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Less is more. Make the wrap simple, yet elegant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fold garments to the size of the box, making sure to tuck any
tickets out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use decorative seals on tissue inside the box.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Put as little tape on wrapping paper as possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Crease wrapping paper on all edges of the box.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finish the ends of ribbon with an angled cut or an inverted V.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ A crush of shoppers filled the aisles Friday
at the Burlington Mall. In the brick-and-mortar world of malls and
stores, the day after Thanksgiving is one of the busiest shopping
days of the year, and the traditional kickoff of theholiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, staring at a bank of video screens in a windowless
room, as many as 60 analysts for GTE Internetworking were also
gearing up for the holiday rush. But for these engineers, who help
ensure the smooth flow of consumer traffic on Internet shopping
sites, it's the Monday after Thanksgiving that will be a key test
of whether the Net is ready to handle the rush of shoppers expected
to go on line this year.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch time on the Web often comes on the boss's time. At the
office, many consumers have access to high-speed Internet
connections, which are far faster than their modems at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as people don't want to admit it, a lot of people are
shopping at work,'' said Chris Yetman, a vice president who helps
run GTE Internetworking's Burlington operations center, which
oversees the firewalls that keep credit card transactions secure
and fix potential trouble spots that could cause on-line gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lunch hours on a work day are some of our busiest times,''
said Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly.com,
which bills itself as the Filene's Basement of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At toysmart.com, marketing director Kelly McGovern had her own
theory about heavy midday activity on her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our customers are stay-at-home moms with small
children,'' she said. ``Stay-at-home moms shop during their kids'
nap time.''
</P>
<P>
   With more holiday shoppers than ever expected to go on line this
year, e-commerce retailers won't be busy just at noon.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly optimistic forecast, the accounting firm Ernst
&AMP; Young projected that the number of on-line holiday shoppers this
year will be triple that of last year; on-line sales are expected
to total $12 billion to $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At Lands' End Inc., which sells everything from cashmere
sweaters to Portuguese flannel sheets, that means the Monday after
Thanksgiving could be busier than ever, both for catalog sales and
for business on its Web site _ landsend.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bass, Lands' End's vice president of e-commerce, said
Mondays are usually the busiest for the company. People window-shop
at a mall over the weekend or browse through a catalog, then get
down to business on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   L. L. Bean Inc. also enjoys big Mondays. For its catalogs and
Web site, the busiest time of the year is often during the second
week in December, spokesman Rich Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a period during which mall retailers experience a
lull. Typically, consumers spend a lot over the Thanksgiving
weekend, take a break, then shop with renewed fervor as Christmas
draws nigh. Often, some of the busiest days of the year fall just
before Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   But because e-commerce retailers need at least a day to ship a
Web site purchase to a consumer, their last-minute frenzy comes
earlier than it does at the malls.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, 1998 was the year on-line holiday shopping went
mainstream. So it's hard to make declarations about changes in
shopping habits based on the statistics of a single year.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television channels that specialize in retailing have
hardly changed shopping patterns. In general, the Home Shopping
Network sees a business rhythm similar to what traditional
retailers report _ a strong burst of activity over Thanksgiving
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many retail Web sites are coping with a flood of new
business as consumers get comfortable shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekly basis, L. L. Bean's sales volumes can be three to
four times greater than for the same periods last year. And Lands'
End reports its increases are nearly comparable.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the big jump in on-line shopping is that retail
Web sites are now attracting a diverse group of consumers, women as
well as men, the old as well as the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just Gen-Xers,'' said Ed Lubieniecki, an Ernst &AMP;
Young partner who specializes in ``e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   While some things change, others remain the same. Like many
traditional retailers, e-commerce Web sites will do a big chunk of
their annual sales during the holiday shopping period.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com expects that it could ring up 90 percent of its
annual sales between October and December.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher E. Vroom, an e-commerce analyst at Thomas Weisel
Partners, said this could be a breakthrough year for on-line toy
buying.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping in toy stores can be such a wretched experience that
many parents will shop instead at sites such as toysmart.com,
eToys.com, or RedRocket.com, he said. But it's possible that
someone could have just as bad an experience on line as they could
in a toy store, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When shoppers endure an unpleasant experience in a mall, they
may be inclined to stick it out. But with retail Web sites, the
competition is just a mouse click away.
</P>
<P>
   On-line toy shoppers, take note. A clever child can retrace the
Web sites that parents have shopped at on a home computer.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Symantec Corp., the folks best known for Norton
anti-virus software, have included a special feature on the Norton
SystemWorks 2000 software package. The feature erases the
footprints left by a PC user shopping on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your kid peeking in the closet where you've
hidden all the toys,'' said Rowan Trollope, Symantec's research
director. ``And you don't want your 8-year-old retracing your
footsteps on the computer to see what you've ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   (Nosy nippers may be one more reason why consumers do their
on-line shopping at work.)
</P>
<P>
   All that shopping from the workplace may help e-commerce
retailers. For traditional stores, it can be all peaks and valleys,
with slow Mondays and frenzied weekends, and such an erratic pace
can make for a bad experience for consumers dealing with
overwhelmed clerks.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the freedom the Internet gives consumers,
allowing them to shop at almost any time, the pace is sometimes
steadier.
</P>
<P>
   For someone such as Send.com founder Mike Lannon, it's hard to
draw sweeping conclusions about on-line shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lannon sold only wine. But in 1999, this year, Send.com
also began selling other products, including cigars, flowers, and
spa visits.
</P>
<P>
   Given the expanded product offerings and the Web's boom, almost
every day has the potential for being the day after Thanksgiving
for Send.com. Said Lannon: ``Every day this week has been the
busiest day of the year for us.''

 &HT;    Discover city's `pockets' full of charm
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Forget chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack
Frost nipping at your nose. And don't even think about folks
dressed up like Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
   In this historic coastal city, signs that the holidays have
arrived are a bit more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   A festive wreath hangs from the outstretched hand of the statue
of stern-faced Colonial evangelist John Wesley in Reynolds Square.
The stone swans in Forsyth Square fountain sport jolly red bows
around their slender necks. The Savannah River Queen paddlewheeler
is draped in garlands of greenery. And horse and carriage drivers
don jaunty Santa caps.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish moss _ not icicles _ drips from ancient live oaks, and
the city's version of the Rockefeller Center ice rink is an inside
affair. At the Savannah Civic Center's exhibition hall,
Savannahians in jeans and T-shirts gamely lace up skates and wobble
out onto the ice under a canopy of lights and flanked by a forest
of gaily decorated Christmas trees.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps best of all _ at least for the shop-till-you-drop
set _ there's fabulous shopping throughout the historic district.
You'll walk your tootsies off visiting hundreds of boutiques, gift
emporiums, antique shops and art galleries.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, one very special Christmas place is the Holiday
Shoppe at Ex Libris, sponsored by the Savannah College of Art and
Design. The shop, across Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard from the
Savannah Visitor's Center, is filled with gifts, pastries and
coffees from around the world. Throughout December, there will be
children's story hours on Saturdays, performances and holiday
seminars. Call 912-525-5225 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Savannah, we accepted the fact that we
couldn't hit every shop in town and concentrated our shopping in
two areas, along Whitaker Street between Jones and Taylor streets
and around the intersection of Bull and Liberty streets near the
Desoto Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Those areas covered, we spent our remaining two hours checking
out the new shops in old storefronts along Broughton Street and
made a quick run through an old favorite, the City Market, a
two-block complex with an eclectic mix of shops, galleries, artists
studios and restaurants. We skipped River Street this time, but
it's worth a stroll.
</P>
<P>
   We started our day at Saints and Shamrocks, where Jeanne
Zittrauer and her family have been selling Irish imports and
religious books, videos, music and gifts to both tourists and
Savannah's large Irish-Catholic population for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we dropped by Morning Star Gallery, where glass artist
Mark McKim showed us a sparkling array of blown glass and stained
glass. That's his Guardian Angel stained glass featuring a cherub
in the window.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion-conscious can find something really unusual at
Gaucho or across Bull Street at Chutzpah. Down Bull Street at the
Arts and Crafts Emporium is a wonderland of handmade wares by more
than 300 artists. And don't miss Soho South Cafe, where you'll
lunch on creative cuisine at mix-matched tables and chairs in a
street cafe-like setting surrounded by art and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, head for the corner of Whitaker and Jones streets.
Here, you'll find the Market, a former piano factory that anchors a
nifty row of shops along the block south to Taylor Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned it into a European marketplace,'' said Melissa
Bagby, who owns the business with Beth Clapp. ``We bought the whole
thing and did it with no money. We got the first CADA (Coastal Area
District Development Authority) loan in the city. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagby, Clapp and other female proprietors in the area refer to
themselves as the ``Whitaker women.'' And they're making quite an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Down Whitaker at Edison Lighting, owner Gale Singer sums up the
area rather succinctly: ``We're a nice little pocket of better
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Savannah is full of such ``pockets'' of shopping. And we can't
wait to find them all.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From Atlanta, take I-75 south to I-16. Travel
east on I-16 into downtown Savannah. It's about a four-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most shops are open 10 a.m.-6 p.m., but hours vary.
Some are open Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Parking lots are dotted about town. Metered parking
is also available, but make sure you feed the meter; no sooner than
the red violation flag goes up, an $8 ticket is slapped on your
window. Visitors can buy a day pass that costs $5 and is valid for
a 48-hour period. Get one at the Parking Services office at 100 E.
Bryan St.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: In shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Most shops are accessible, although there
are steps down to some street-level shops.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: 1-877-728-2662 or on the Web at
www.savannahvisit.com (Savannah Area Convention and Visitors
Bureau). The Savannah Scene Web site is also helpful:
www.savannah.com.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accommodations: We wouldn't think of staying anywhere but an
inn _ of which there are more than 30 in the historic district.
Expect to pay at least $80 a night; some tariffs run considerably
higher. For a selection, call for a Simply Savannah Visitor's Guide
at 1-877-728-2662 or check the Web at www.savannahvisit.com.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dining: Have lunch surrounded by art and antiques at newcomer
Soho South Cafe (12 W. Liberty St., 912-233-1633) after you shop
the Liberty and Bull intersection. We recommend the Andalusian
Chicken Salad ($8.75) and mixed berry shortcake ($5). If you find
yourself in the Whitaker and Jones street area at lunchtime, try
the home cooking at Mrs. Wilkes Dining Room (107 W. Jones St.,
912-232-5997). If lunchtime finds you at the City Market, go for
the Southern buffet at The Lady and Sons (311 W. Congress St.,
912-233-2600).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond shopping
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q: Recently I read an article regarding a new perfume called
Southernness. Could you please tell me where and when this
particular perfume will be available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peggie Crumley, Fayetteville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This scent of the South is a blend of flora from 12 Southern
states. Taking a chance on the obvious, we quickly found the
fragrance on the Web at www.southernness.com. A 3.4-ounce bottle is
$42. It also comes in the form of powders, body lotion, talc and
sachet. Southernness is the creation of garden artist Benn Johnson
of Birmingham. Several years ago, Johnson decided he actually
wanted to smell one of his paintings. With the aid of French
perfumer Phillipe Lorson, he came up with the floral scent.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of stores in Atlanta that carry the fragrance and
related items, includes: Parisian stores, the Atlanta History
Center's Museum Shop (404-814-4075), Ivy Rose in Stone Mountain
(770-413-1213), Shoppe of Vinings in Vinings (770-433-1690) and
Presents Requested in Alpharetta (770-664-6882). Items are priced
from $18-$45.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a Pendleton shirt, which lasts me from 10-15
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walter Bryner, Douglasville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Pendleton Woolen Mills, a dyed-in-the-wool American company,
has been churning out men's shirts since 1924. The Portland,
Ore.-based company has been in business since the late 1800s when
it began producing wool blankets for neighboring Native American
tribes, and later clothing for men and women. Today, men's
Pendleton shirts come in 10 styles, in 75 exclusive patterns.
Prices start at about $61 for a wool shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Shop at home by visiting the company's Web site:
www.pendleton-usa.com. Click on shopping basket, then menswear
gifts and stock up. You can also buy these classics in Atlanta at
Vinings Pendleton, 4300 Paces Ferry Road N.W., Suite 255
(770-384-1777) and Pendleton of Dunwoody, 5488 Chamblee Dunwoody
Road, Suite 8 (770-698-8005).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Until recently I could buy stollen imported from Germany at
several Atlanta stores. Now I can't find it anywhere. Could you
find me a source?
</P>
<P>
   _ Daryl H. Hiller, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This traditional Christmas yeast bread is filled with dried
fruits, raisins, almonds and spices and iced with a sugar frosting.
A yummy confection, it dates to the Middle Ages. We found stollen
on the Internet by using the search engine Yahoo, then typing in
``stollen,'' ``German'' and ``bread.'' One Web source is www
</P>
<P>
   .fancyfoods.com/stollen. Made by Rossbach Specialty Food _ under
the Elzer name _ its stollen is $5.50 for a 1-pound, 10.4-ounce
loaf. This company's stollen is also available in Wal-Mart
Supercenter stores in Georgia for $3.99.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web source is www.sbakingco.com/products/stollen. The
Santa Barbara Baking Co. soaks its stollen in rum for 24 hours
before baking. The price for a 1 1/2-pound loaf is $12.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in purchasing wooden Tinker Toys like the
ones my brother and I played with as children. I have seen the
plastic versions in stores but they seem to be larger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharon Salsberry, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Tinker, doodle, fiddle! Your beloved wooden rod-and-connector
toy is no longer being made by Playskool, a division of Hasbro.
However, a Texas manufacturer, Toys-N-Things (T-N-T) International,
has come out with Fiddlestix, an alternative construction set of
rods, spools, balls, wheels and squares. A spokesman for T-N-T told
us Fiddlestix are manufactured in the same circa 1860s Northeast
wood-working factory that made the original sets for Hasbro. The
company does not have the rights to the Tinker Toy name; hence, the
Fiddlestix moniker.
</P>
<P>
   You can purchase Fiddlestix on the Internet at www
</P>
<P>
   .somedayisle.com/toys/constrct
</P>
<P>
   /tinker.htm. A 120-piece wooden set is $58. We discovered this
site by using the search engine Dogpile and typing in ``tinker
toys.'' We scrolled through the offerings until we found this link.
You can also call 1-800-388-6313 and order the toy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to know where to buy a medical alert bracelet. They
used to be advertised, but now I can't find them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia Lynch, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This life-saving jewelry makes a great gift for a loved one.
We searched the Internet for ``medical alert bracelet'' on the
search engine Yahoo, then followed the links to two sites.
</P>
<P>
   One is www.oneida-medical-jewelry.com. Oneida Nameplate Co. in
Manchester, Iowa, makes engraved medical bracelets as well as
charms and necklaces in stainless steel, enamel, 24k gold and Black
Hills gold. All items bear the universal medical alert symbol and
are engraved with your medical and contact information. Prices for
bracelets range from $15.95 to $207.95; charms and necklaces range
from $5.95-$167.95. Or call 319-925-2586 to order the jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The SOS medical locket, made by Slim Line Products, is also
available online at www.soalert.com. It's available as a necklace,
bracelet, sneaker tag, key chain and children's wristband in
silvertone stainless steel and gold-plated stainless steel, ranging
from $35-$79.50. The locket is embossed with the universal medical
alert symbol that tells persons to look inside for vital
information _ folded inside on paper. Call 1-800-224-3535 to order
this jewelry.

IN LOVE FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by the latest sales figures, consumers are falling in
love with Apple Computer's new iBook line of laptops. And for the
wrong reason, I'll wager.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, cute. Even cuter than the iMac desktop
machines that began Apple's renaissance. Compared to the common
ruck of black and gray and beige PC laptops, the iBook stands out
like a cocktail waitress in a convent.
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, the $1,600 iBook is a pretty good computer, or so
it seems when I'm using it on my dining-room table. Alas, it's not
nearly so much fun on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Though it boasts a thin, light lithium ion battery, the iBook
still comes in at 6.6 pounds, not counting the power adapter. I
felt every ounce of the weight after trudging through a few
airports in search of connecting flights. The iBook's built-in
plastic handle cuts into your fingers, and its gaudy good looks are
an invitation to thieves. So I ended up schlepping it about in a
canvas shoulder bag. I suspect most users will, if only to protect
the pretty case. So why bother with a built-in handle?
</P>
<P>
   The iBook's designers must believe that the Internet will render
air travel obsolete. Why else design a portable computer that can't
be used comfortably on an airplane? In the past couple of months,
I've tried the iBook on a number of 727s, as well as a 757 and an
MD-88. It's impossible to fully open the iBook's huge,
clamshell-shaped lid on an airline tray, even before the guy in
front of you tilts his seat back. I know the iBook was meant for
students and casual users who don't fly very often. Still, why not
a portable that's a bit more portable?
</P>
<P>
   Once I arrived at a destination, I found the iBook a much more
congenial companion, with a gorgeous 12-inch display, a solid
keyboard feel and decent performance _ especially after Apple sent
an extra 32 megabytes of memory. The idea was to illustrate how
easy it is to upgrade the unit. I was duly impressed, but also
frustrated by the fact that the iBook comes with a measly 32 megs
of memory as standard-issue. And while the 3.2-gigabyte hard drive
is adequate, it's small compared to PC laptops.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the iBook suffers from the same fundamental flaw as
the original iMac. It's not so much a serious computer as a fashion
accessory that can run spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, I have begun to succumb to the iBook's charm, now that
I've had a chance to try out its most fashionable accessory _
built-in wireless networking.
</P>
<P>
   Apple calls it AirPort. For $99, you can plug a card into the
iBook that connects to an antenna already built into the laptop.
Instantly, the machine becomes capable of sending and receiving
data at speeds of up to 11 million bits per second, faster than a
wired Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   The new-generation iMacs also take AirPort cards, and since I
just happen to have the new iMac DV Special Edition in the
graphite-gray case, I slipped AirPort cards into the iMac and the
iBook to create an instant computer network for swapping files
between machines. With a range of 150 feet and a wireless signal
that can pass through walls, the AirPort is a cheap and simple way
to connect multiple home computers. By the way, AirPort uses an
international standard for wireless networking, so the system will
work with similar products made for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the $300 AirPort base station, a
flying-saucer-looking thing with a built in 56-kilobit modem and an
Ethernet connection. It can serve as a single connection point to
the Internet for a whole houseful of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The base station software was incompatible with my Internet
provider, Concentric Network. Apple says it will fix this in a
future upgrade. But then I signed up with the Earthlink Internet
service, and found I could wander the Web wirelessly, while the
base station sat 50 feet away. Apple plans another software upgrade
that'll let users turn any AirPort-equipped machine into a base
station, providing Internet access to other computers on the
wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort needs no dangling wires or prodding antennas. Install it
in an iBook, and the computer still looks cool. Only now, with
wireless networking, the iBook really is cool.

BRITANNICA SITE A HIT, BUT EXTRAS NEED WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Encyclopedia Britannica announced last month that it was
offering its 32-volume set for free on the Internet, up to 15
million people flocked to the Web site, which crashed within hours
and was down for days. In a single day, the site attracted more
traffic than last month's star-studded NetAid concert and last
year's Victoria's Secret fashion show combined.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Apparently, folks are desperate for credibility on the
Internet, and the 231-year-old publisher has a reputation for
reliability _ if not technical prowess. Hail Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not get too misty-eyed about the triumph of knowledge
over lingerie just yet. Britannica.com is back on line, and it's
sending out mixed signals. It fashions itself as an information
portal, with news from the Washington Post and 76 magazines, as
well as free e-mail and weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the e-mail and the weather and the news: Nobody goes to
the encyclopedia to check the temperature in Tucson. The research
tools are what matter most. And that's where the site is sending
out mixed signals. The encyclopedia itself is enough to make a
librarian's daughter dance: The searchable database instantly pulls
up Britannica's expert articles on everything from a-ak (an ancient
Asian music) to Zywiec (a Polish town). The hypertext links from
one article to another make preliminary research so easy it's hard
to imagine ever thumbing through the stacks again.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the encyclopedia entries, the site offers three
other kinds of material for each topic searched: a list of ``Best
Web sites,'' suggested magazine articles, and selected books. In
theory, that's a great idea. In practice, it's another thing
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the results for these searches:
</P>
<P>
   Boston _ The top Web site is www.bostonpunk.net, a site offering
an introduction to the city's punk rock scene. The top book on the
list is ``Boston Dog Lover's Companion: The Inside Scoop on Where
to Take Your Dog.'' For dog-free researchers, the book list
includes ``Boston Wedding Planner'' and ``God is a Bullet: A
Novel,'' by Boston Teran, a book described in a Globe review as
``disturbing and disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet _ The best Web sites include the Pediatric Internet
Directory, the Internet Baby Mall, and a site celebrating
Australia's Poetry Heritage. There is also a link to
netaddiction.com, a site for keyboard junkies.
</P>
<P>
   Mick Jagger _ There must be something going on down under,
because a search for the former Rolling Stone includes a link to a
site called ``Mick's Footy,'' a news site about the Australian
National Rugby League.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting a search hasn't been this much fun since the early
days of the Internet, when a query about breast cancer would yield
recipes for chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Devereaux, Britannica.com's vice president of product
development and editorial, admits that the search engine is creaky
and says the company is tweaking it. ``Most sites have the
opportunity to do what's called a `soft launch,' but we didn't have
that opportunity,'' he says. ``We sent out one press release on
Oct. 19, and we were swamped with requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Britannica.com also rates Web sites, an arduous task in a realm
where it's often hard to distinguish between fact and fiction. Some
of the capsule reviews are informative, but others lack the kind of
skepticism necessary on line. The review for Harry Knowles' Ain't
It Cool News, for instance, fails to mention that much of the
material found on the site is unreliable gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Britannica is messing around with its brand name, which stands
for facts and reliable research. But the Internet, by its nature,
is unreliable, and the encyclopedia editors have not figured out
how to communicate the difference yet. But you can't beat the price
for the encyclopedia entries, and the search results for the other
categories are certainly amusing. And hey, if you ever want to take
your dog to a punk rock club in Boston, Britannica can lead the
way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Speaking of encyclopedic knowledge, it's next to impossible
to keep track of everything that's written about any given subject
these days. That's why we need Web sites like www.artsjournal.com,
a concise compilation of headlines in the arts from all over the
world. It's the brainchild of Douglas McLennon, a former reporter
for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Weekly. McLennon
is at his home computer every morning by 5, combing through more
than 100 on-line publications to glean the best stories of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like curating a magazine,'' says McLennon. ``It's like
taking this vast sea of raw stuff out there and trying to put it
together in an interesting way.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, launched last month, has already gained the support of
two major foundations, and McLennon has plans to expand it. For
now, the site offers a simple, easy way to stay in touch with the
good, the bad, and the beautiful in the world of arts and films.
And every now and then it includes a link to a paper in Australia,
just like Britannica.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  If you can't attract users with Australian links, you can
always lure them with cash and prizes. This week, Lycos launched a
$5 million lottery promotion; users sign up to receive ``lucky
numbers'' to play against Lycos daily winning numbers. Last month,
CBS joined forces with a small Internet company to launch iWon.com,
a portal similar to ABC's go.com and NBC's Snap.com. The site is
giving away cold cash, with a daily prize of $10,000, a monthly
prize of $1 million, and an annual prize of $10 million. And
another company called epipo.com is paying users a small fee to
surf the Internet and look at selected ads while they browse. It's
the latest trend: If you pay them, they will come.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Consumer protection forces also staked out on Internet
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's just common sense. More people shop this time of
year, so more people encounter problems with products that don't
live up to the billing, or they find customer service that seems
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   There's help on the Web. Some of the most familiar names in
consumer protection have homes there, along with some effective
organizations that you may not know about.
</P>
<P>
   When most people think of consumer help, the Better Business
Bureau comes to mind. You'll find that site at www.bbb.org. There's
a nice, common-sense organizational method to this site. At the top
of the page, you'll find quick links to the areas that most
consumers need, which include: locating a BBB bureau in your area;
reading alerts about suspect businesses and business practices;
getting advice on resolving disputes; or filing a complaint with
the bureau. You can also go directly to www.bbb.org
</P>
<P>
   /complaints/company.html and use the pull-down menus to file a
complaint online.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports magazine tops the list for most people when it
comes to getting straight talk about products and scams. The
magazine has an excellent site at www.consumerreports.com/. Without
paying a cent, you can get solid consumer tips. But to read the
articles in the current issue of the magazine (last week there were
evaluations on DVD systems, a popular holiday gift; advice on
``bargain computers'' and the rebates that are becoming popular;
and a report on batteries), you must subscribe to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how that works. You pay $3.95 a month or $24 for a year
($19 if you're a Consumer Reports magazine subscriber). Most pay
sites aren't worth the money since there's so much free information
on the Web. But if you find value in the sort of information
published in the magazine and don't want the print version, it may
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, make sure that you stop by the Consumers
Union site. It's the consumer advocacy Web site of Consumers Union,
publisher of Consumer Reports. You'll find it at www
</P>
<P>
   .consumersunion.org/. This is a good, hard-nosed site that
offers real help. And you can get the information in either English
or Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help or advice concerning a possible scam or
business fraud, a good site for you is the National Fraud
Information Center at www.fraud.org
</P>
<P>
   /welcome.htm. It was formed in 1992 by the National Consumers
League, which claims to be the oldest nonprofit consumer
organization in the United States, to deal with telemarketing
fraud. But with the growing popularity of e-commerce (and e-fraud),
a section on Internet fraud has been added. You can go directly to
that section at www.fraud
</P>
<P>
   .org/internet/intinfo.htm, or follow the links from the main
page.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has its own Web clearinghouse for
consumer complaints and advice at the site called U.S. Consumer
Gateway at www.consumer
</P>
<P>
   .gov/. You'll get consumer advice there, as you'd expect, as
well as tips on product safety, consumer fraud and also a review of
the companies that the FTC has taken action against.

UNTANGLING WEB PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does the World Wide Web belong inside your telephone?
</P>
<P>
   That's the vision of the future that companies like Sprint,
Qualcomm, and Phone.com are loading into the proverbial
technological pipeline. The theory is to combine two of the hottest
digital technologies _ the Internet and wireless telephones _ into
a single handheld device that can be all things to people on the
go.
</P>
<P>
   I got my first taste of a wireless Web phone back in 1997, when
AT&AMP;T introduced PocketNet. The system let me send and receive
e-mail, read news headlines, get stock quotes, and browse the World
Wide Web. It was pretty cool at the time, but the phone was huge _
a big brick with a difficult-to-use interface. I gave the phone
back after a few weeks, and AT&AMP;T was never very successful with the
project.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Sprint PCS reintroduced the wireless Web concept,
building a Web server into its newest generation of digital phones.
Unlike the old PocketNet phone, the new Web phones are the same
size as standard phones _ they simply have a few more options on
their menus.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using my Sprint TouchPoint, upgraded with the latest
Wireless Web software. To place a call on the Internet, you simply
select the word ``MiniBrowser'' from the phone's built-in menu and
press the ``OK'' button. A few moments later, the phone's screen
changes to review your Internet ``Home Page.''
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone's size makes accessing the Internet quite a
challenge. Most pages on the Internet today are designed to be
viewed with PC-sized screens _ at least 640 pixels across and 480
pixels down, or roughly 25 lines of 80 characters each. The
TouchPoint's screen is much smaller _ just five lines of 14
characters each.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the keyboard. Most Web sites assume that you
can type and use a mouse; the TouchPoint has just the buttons on
the telephone keypad, an OK button, a CLR button, and some arrows.
The keypad makes it easy to type a number, like your ZIP code, but
rather difficult to type things like user names, passwords, or even
stock symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to make sense of standard Web pages, the
TouchPoint's MiniBrowser takes a different approach. Most pages on
the Web today are written in a language called HTML, the Internet's
pervasive HyperText Markup Language. But in order to view a page
with the MiniBrowser, it's got to be rewritten into HDML, or
Handheld Device Markup Language.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites, such as Yahoo and CNN, have created HDML versions of
their home pages. CNN lets you read news briefs in five categories:
international, US, stock markets, business, and show business.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are much shorter than those you would get at CNN's
Web site, but they are up-to-date. On the Yahoo and Weather Channel
Web sites, you can get weather forecasts by city or ZIP code. If
you have a Yahoo account, you can even read or send e-mail.
InfoSpace lets you look up a name or business in a phone book;
GetThere.com will let you type in your address and where you want
to go and then give you directions.
</P>
<P>
   I found most of these services to be somewhat interesting, but
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I could use GetThere to get directions for driving
from my house to an appointment in Boston. But if I actually wanted
to use those directions, I had to write them down: There was no way
to save them in my phone so that I could review them as I drove.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem with HDML is its lack of ubiquity: Although a
few Web sites have put up HDML pages, most haven't. Today you
can't, for example, read The Boston Globe's Boston.com Web site on
the Sprint PCS phones.
</P>
<P>
   (One company, Digital Paths, plans to offer a Web service that
will translate standard HTML pages into HDML, but how well such a
service will work _ especially with Web pages that are filled with
graphics _ remains to be seen.)
</P>
<P>
   My biggest concern with the MiniBrowser is that it takes a lot
of attention to use.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to click just the right buttons and then peer into
the little screen. Forget about using InfoSpace while you are
driving _ it's far easier, and safer, to simply call directory
assistance. Indeed, I tried using the Web browser while walking and
nearly stepped into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing is another issue. Sprint PCS' middle-of-the-road plan in
New England gives callers 500 minutes of air time for $50. Add
Wireless Web access, and the price jumps to roughly $90 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: I think that there is a great future for
integrating the Web with mobile telephones. CNN's wireless Web site
would be great if, instead of forcing me to read the articles, I
could hear a report _ or even a whole set of reports, each one
tailored to my preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to view my mailbox on my Web phone would be a lot
better if the phone could somehow weed out the three vital e-mail
messages from the other 250 I get every day.
</P>
<P>
   InfoSpace would be infinitely more useful if the Web site could
use Sprint's network to figure out where I was standing and then
give me directions to the nearest sushi bar.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than type on a 10-digit keypad, I would much rather
simply talk to the phone and have it understand what I want.
</P>
<P>
   All of these advanced features will require breakthroughs in
computing speed, speech synthesis, speech recognition, and
artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the current generation of Wireless Web phones
are sure to get more interesting as more services become available.
But many people who get these phones might end up simply buying the
special ``data cable'' that lets them use the phone as a wireless
fax/modem for a laptop computer or Palm Pilot. Using a phone to
make phone calls and a computer to access the Internet might seem
old-fashioned, but it still works quite well.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Spread joy, give away that old PC
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My favorite computers _ the ones that have lasted for
years and years, even if it is just in my heart _ are the ones I
gave away.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the computer that sits on my desk now, they continue to
give me joy.
</P>
<P>
   Since part of my job is to tell you how to get the most from
computing, I feel comfortable telling you to consider giving a
computer away this holiday season. After all, many of you will get
a new one as a holiday gift.
</P>
<P>
   You may find that the best use for that old computer is to give
it to someone who doesn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with profiting from a good deed. Giving
the old computer away can serve as a good argument for doing
something you've been wanting to do anyway ... buy one of those
new, more powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   But the best reason is to share the magic of computing with
someone less fortunate. A computer is just a box of silicon chips,
resistors and circuit boards. Yet, it can do magical things. Mine
is a terrific electronic typewriter as I write this column, but _
at the click of a mouse _ it can become an entertaining game
machine, or one of the world's best research tools. That's truly
magic.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about sharing magic is that _ unlike sharing your
lunch _ the more you give the more magic you have.
</P>
<P>
   I don't need to make a long pitch about how computers are
important for kids. Going to school these days without a computer
puts a kid at a real disadvantage. The other kids go home and
cruise the Web for reference material and then prepare a fancy
homework project using pictures and information they found on the
Internet. Those without a computer are stuck doing things the
old-fashioned way. It's not impossible to get by that way, but why
not lift a burden in lives that already have enough challenges?
</P>
<P>
   The need for computers isn't limited to kids. One of the real
surprises _ at least for me _ is the way computers have changed the
lives of older people. Maybe, in your own family, there is a
relative who would never think of buying a computer but who could
profit from one. All of a sudden, with the aid of one of the free
e-mail services and a computer, a person who felt alone and out of
touch can have friends around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And there are still other places where a computer could make a
difference. Many charities and churches operate on a tight budget.
An extra computer, even an old clunker, can make things easier
there, too. Even the most outdated of computers can produce
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't come up with a recipient for your old computer,
I'll offer a suggestion. There's an organization here in Atlanta
called Freebytes that refurbishes old computers and then finds a
good home for them. I'm sure that there are thousands of places
like this across the country; I just happen to know about this one.
You can read about them at www.freebytes.org. If you go to that Web
page, you'll find a history of the group, the kind of machines it
will accept, a mailing address and phone number. I recommend that
you check them out on the Web, but to get you started, the
telephone number is (404) 846-8414.
</P>
<P>
   And, even folks who don't have a computer to give away can help.
There's information on that page telling you how to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one possible way to share the magic. There are
plenty of good homes for that old computer of yours, maybe even
within your own family. And that's half the fun of playing
millionaire for a day, finding just the right recipient. If you do,
I promise you the kind of magic that can make this the best holiday
season you've ever had.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Sound enhancer fails test
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The SoundScience Universal Audio Dynamic Sound
Improvement Processor promises to ``enhance reproduction for
fuller, cleaner, undiluted sound with sharp mid-tones, crisp
trebles and powerful bass'' from your CD player, television,
computer, DVD player, radio, cassette player, satellite receiver
and video game consoles.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is what does ``enhance'' mean? The
promotional material the company provided was a little vague, so
the Dayton Daily News asked for a sample unit to see for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   I tried out the unit on my middle-of-the-road quality home
stereo to get the layman's opinion and turned it over to Dayton
Daily News audio columnist Don Loose for a professional
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Both of us came to the same conclusion: The SoundScience device,
called by its initials DSIP, seems to boost bass and treble tones
dramatically, but the results sounded distorted. It might be a good
product to attach to an inexpensive stereo or boombox to jack up
the bass response, but it's probably not for true high fidelity
sound lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The DSIP is a silver plastic box about six inches across powered
by an AC adapter. It came with RCA-type plugs to connect it to
stereo components.
</P>
<P>
   To test the DSIP, Loose said he placed it in the tape loop of a
hi-fi system known for its transparency. He played two CDs with
which he was very familiar. The first was a Holly Cole CD featuring
female vocal, acoustic bass, acoustic piano, and a string section.
The second was the recently released Columbus Jazz Orchestra 25th
anniversary CD, ``Band At Work,'' which he recorded and engineered
himself in live concert settings.
</P>
<P>
   Loose didn't care for the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, in one Holly Cole take, the string bass plays in
unison with low piano notes, and you can clearly hear the two
timbres in unison,'' Loose said. ``The DSIP obliterates the
separate timbres into a single muddy bass line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treble fared no better. The first thing to jump out were
distorted sibilants in Holly's voice which weren't there when the
DSIP was out of the system. The Columbus Jazz Orchestra sounded
really tinny _ not like the sound of real brass or woodwinds.''
</P>
<P>
   I connected the DSIP to my video recorder and played a battle
scene passage from ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.'' The first
thing I noticed was an immediate increase in rumbling bass tones
associated with explosions.
</P>
<P>
   But I also noticed an unpleasant buzzy, tinny undertone as
characters spoke. And high-pitched laser blasts had an effect like
scraping fingernails across a chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   SoundScience sells the Universal Audio DSIP for $90 online at
its Web site at www.soundscience.com. You can also order by phone
by calling (201) 767-3297.
</P>
<P>
   Other products in the SoundScience's line include less expensive
units for travel and for television only.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    E.com cometh, but it's a Mall world
 &HT;    (Package includes ONLINE-SHOPPING, ONLINE-DEALS, ONLINE-LISTS,
ONLINE-COLUMN.)
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 2 a.m. and the order just went through on Amazon.com for
some books I'll give as gifts later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the hype over Internet shopping was starting to
build. This year, it can't even be called hype. It's real. You can
shop whenever you want, buying CDs, movies and freshly baked
cookies, using the newest technology to have something delivered
via one of the oldest, by postal service.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for books and movies online has become a habit for me.
When a new DVD that I want is released or the latest Stephen King
behemoth hits the shelves, I shop virtually, looking for the best
price and the lowest shipping.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than a year since I've gone to the mall and
browsed the shelves at a Waldenbooks or B. Dalton's. Maybe it's the
best thing, that malls aren't the best place to shop anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Malls and superstores destroyed the mom and pop operations that
sold us our boots, our groceries, our books for so long. And now,
out of nowhere, the mom and pops of cyberland (these are
22-year-old moms and pops, I know), are beating back the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Will malls, with their color-coded directories and parking lots
stretching out forever, die out?
</P>
<P>
   Part of me hopes so. There's Darwinism afoot, and right now,
e-commerce sites have the edge. It's easier. You don't deal with
crowds or parking. You don't even pay tax. It's inherently
appealing, easy, safer than you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   But then I think I'd miss the mall. At least two generations of
kids grew up in those stacked, air-conditioned shrines. We saw the
rise and fall and rise again of video arcades. Watched the Gap
dress us up until we couldn't tell each other apart. We shopped for
last minute-gifts attached to last-minute greeting cards chosen at
the Hallmark store.
</P>
<P>
   I think I would miss people watching, seeing those who dress up
to go to the mall, in high heels and bright lipstick, shopping at
Nine West for more high-heeled shoes to wear to another mall. I'd
miss the parents tempting fate with precariously poised strollers
teetering at escalator precipices.
</P>
<P>
   I might not miss greasy pizza, but I would miss the mayonnaise
at Chick-fil-A, caramel pecan Cinnabons and the famous Orange
Julius. In fact, let's just lay it out there, sons and daughters of
the digital age. Who is going to make us our Orange Julius fix
online? Who is going to put the starchy dehydrated milk powder in
the blender, mix it with fruit and serve it to us in a paper cup?
</P>
<P>
   I love and hate the mall. I want to avoid it, but when I'm there
I feel the magnetic pull of a junky, beautiful, wasteful and glossy
culture. If it were a dessert, it would be lime sherbet, all gaudy
and smooth, numbing and unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The online world of shopping can be cheaper. Faster. Easier. But
the mall is a guilty pleasure, a big tub of popcorn and sweets,
happy to drown us, to overload us, catering to our every whim; it's
got everything you need, want and can't have, the comforts and 72
degrees of manufactured air.
</P>
<P>
   Malls won't die. They'll just become more decadent. You may

American-Statesman, at ogallaga(at)statesman.com.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Marvelous, versatile maps detail Appalachian Trail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a kind of romance about the Appalachian Trail
that touches most folks, I think, even if they never intend to set
foot on it. It's something of a miracle that the trail even exists,
all the way from Georgia to Maine, and that every year some people
walk the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech's marvelous set of four CD-ROMs, presenting linked U.S.
Geological Survey topograpical maps of the whole trail and vast
areas around it, will appeal to everyone. But it will be of
greatest interest to those who have, or plan to, walk some portion
of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no cartographer, but it seems to me that Maptech has put
these maps together and provided means of examining them that leave
little to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Two general views are available _ each of the USGS maps
individually, or a seamless view of the entire area covered on the
disk. The single-map view is useful if you want to see the
information included on the edges of the maps. If you want to use
the two-map view, the screen is split into two windows on which
widely separated areas can be viewed next to each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the seamless view will probably be the one most used. Maps
of 1:24,000 scale and 1:100,000 are included and can be viewed at
zoom ratios of from 1:4 to 2:1. At 2:1, the map from edge to edge
of the window covers only about 1,350 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Changing from one cursor style to another produces various
results. The hand cursor, as usual, drags the map around. The
pointer is used to click on various symbols along the trail to
provide more information. For instance, at Blood Mountain, probably
the most popular point along the trail in Georgia, you find full
information on its historic significance, current rules for camping
and using the shelter and a couple of excellent photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Two distance tools are included. One is used to produce the
straight-line distance between two points, or even to find the
square footage of a defined area. The other is a freehand tool,
used for finding the actual distance along any trail, either the
Appalachian Trail or a trail you define.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a means of determining the true distance,
including changes in elevation. Terrain profiles and line-of-sight
information can be viewed for every track or distance line
established.
</P>
<P>
   The user can establish markers and create and edit tracks on any
of the maps. Those markers will appear in the go-to menu along with
all the markers already set up on the map.
</P>
<P>
   All the maps or sections of them can be printed out, along with
any self-defined features. Likewise, the trails and their waypoints
can be uploaded to a hand-held GPS device for carrying on the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The maps contain an area of up to 3 miles on each side of the
trail. All the features of the maps _ campsites, latitude-longitude
grids and the like _ are in the form of overlays, which can be
removed and returned to view at will. Latitude and longitude of the
cursor, and the elevation of the point which it is touching, are
all shown in windows on the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways of finding some point on the maps. You can
search by name, or get an enormous list of place types, from caves
to mines, select one and look at the list produced. Coves,
incidentally, are included with valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The online help is the best I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   The four regional CDs that comprise the set can be purchased for
$39 apiece, and the set for $139. Go to www.maptech.com or call the
company at (800) 627-7236.

`NO POPERY,' SAYS THE U.S. CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the 19th century, ``no popery'' was a popular political
slogan in the United States. Because the nation's Protestant
majority feared the power of the fast-growing Roman Catholic
minority, anti-Catholic candidates won seats in Congress by
condemning the Roman church.
 &HT;    Using political means, Protestants legally enforced
discrimination against Roman Catholics. By warning of the tyranny
of the pope and evils of the church, they often incited violence
against Catholics -- especially priests, monks, and nuns.
 &HT;    Who would have guessed that echoes of ``No Popery'' still
resound in the halls of Congress?
 &HT;    Last week, the House of Representatives chose the Rev. Charles
Parker Wright, a Presbyterian minister, as their new chaplain.
Wright was last on a list of three candidates selected by a
bipartisan committee to fill the vacancy. The first candidate, and
overwhelming choice of the selection committee, was the Rev.
Timothy J. O'Brien, a Roman Catholic priest.
 &HT;    Although the post of House chaplain was created in 1789, no
Catholic has ever served in that capacity. With the O'Brien
recommendation, Congress was set to make history.
 &HT;    Despite the committee's recommendation, however, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and House majority leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), both Protestants, chose Wright over O'Brien, citing
Wright as ``the one who would jell the best with the members (of
the House) and their families.''
 &HT;    Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) stated, ``As a member of the House
and a member of the committee and as a Catholic, I'm offended and
resentful.''
 &HT;    O'Brien remarked, ``I'm not convinced that the prejudicial view
is gone, and I do believe that if I were not a Catholic priest I
would be the House chaplain.''
 &HT;    A Roman Catholic chaplain would not pose a problem for most
Americans. The majority of Protestants live in blissful ignorance
-- or embarrassed regret -- of their ancestors' discriminatory
past. Indeed, earlier this autumn, Lutherans and Roman Catholics
issued a joint statement, a kind of theological peace treaty,
proclaiming their agreement over some of the concerns that had
divided them since the 16th century Reformation. The U.S. Congress
might have celebrated this happy ecumenical moment with O'Brien's
appointment.
 &HT;    Hastert and Armey chose not to make history. Instead, they chose
to revisit America's sad history of anti-Catholicism.
 &HT;    Hastert and Armey's primary constituency is that of conservative
evangelicals and fundamentalists associated with the religious
right. Unlike their more liberal Protestant kin, they are neither
ignorant of, nor embarrassed by, past tensions between Protestants
and Roman Catholics.
 &HT;    Theologically, conservative Protestants do not believe that
Roman Catholics are ``saved.'' Catholics, so the argument runs, are
not ``born again'' (only those ``born again'' can be assured of
heaven). Instead, Roman Catholics depend on sacraments and good
works for salvation. This, conservative evangelicals believe, is
contrary to the Bible.
 &HT;    Thus, Catholics must repent of their sins (and usually their
association with the Catholic Church) in order to avoid eternal
damnation. Catholics are prime targets for evangelistic crusades.
 &HT;    Politically, however, conservative Protestants have often found
common cause with Roman Catholics. In the last 20 years, these
traditionally hostile groups worked together opposing abortion,
divorce and homosexual rights. During the heyday of the Christian
Coalition, Ralph Reed tried to form a Catholic Alliance as an arm
of the larger organization. He recognized the political power that
unity between conservative Protestants and Catholics promised.
 &HT;    But all attempts at bridge-building failed. In this case,
politics did not triumph over theology.
 &HT;    That Hastert and Armey were unable to shake anti-Catholic
prejudice should surprise no one. Hastert attended Wheaton College,
an evangelical school with few Catholic students and no Catholic
faculty members. There, Catholic doctrine -- particularly when
Hastert was a student-- would not have been presented
sympathetically.
 &HT;    Armey, even during his interview with O'Brien, confessed, ``I
was raised in North Dakota where there's lots of Lutherans, who
always complained about Catholics.''
 &HT;    During the final interview, O'Brien complained that he ran into
an ``evangelical Protestant line of questioning,'' including being
asked his favorite Bible verses and how hard it must be to be an
unmarried priest.
 &HT;    The only surprise is how ignorant these men are -- and from that
position of ignorance they are making public policy. These are the
same people who want to reinstate prayer in school and post the Ten
Commandments in classrooms?
 &HT;    To those of us with eyes to see, the O'Brien debacle reveals the
theology behind such an innocent-seeming agenda -- they want to
make all Americans into their image of what a Christian should be.
 &HT;    God help them. They really needed a Catholic priest. A rabbi, an
imam and a Buddhist monk probably wouldn't hurt, either.

`NO POPERY,' SAYS THE U.S. CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the 19th century, ``no popery'' was a popular political
slogan in the United States. Because the nation's Protestant
majority feared the power of the fast-growing Roman Catholic
minority, anti-Catholic candidates won seats in Congress by
condemning the Roman church.
 &HT;    Using political means, Protestants legally enforced
discrimination against Roman Catholics. By warning of the tyranny
of the pope and evils of the church, they often incited violence
against Catholics -- especially priests, monks, and nuns.
 &HT;    Who would have guessed that echoes of ``No Popery'' still
resound in the halls of Congress?
 &HT;    Last week, the House of Representatives chose the Rev. Charles
Parker Wright, a Presbyterian minister, as their new chaplain.
Wright was last on a list of three candidates selected by a
bipartisan committee to fill the vacancy. The first candidate, and
overwhelming choice of the selection committee, was the Rev.
Timothy J. O'Brien, a Roman Catholic priest.
 &HT;    Although the post of House chaplain was created in 1789, no
Catholic has ever served in that capacity. With the O'Brien
recommendation, Congress was set to make history.
 &HT;    Despite the committee's recommendation, however, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and House majority leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), both Protestants, chose Wright over O'Brien, citing
Wright as ``the one who would jell the best with the members (of
the House) and their families.''
 &HT;    Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) stated, ``As a member of the House
and a member of the committee and as a Catholic, I'm offended and
resentful.''
 &HT;    O'Brien remarked, ``I'm not convinced that the prejudicial view
is gone, and I do believe that if I were not a Catholic priest I
would be the House chaplain.''

<P>
   It's better to give than to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Ha!
</P>
<P>
   The best part of Christmas shopping is picking up a ton of stuff
for yourself, guilt-free. You just throw it in your basket (or
e-basket) along with everyone else's presents, and pretend it's
just another holiday gift expense. This little game is especially
easy to play when you're buying online. If you don't have to haul
in all the extra bags from your car, it's far simpler to overlook
that most of it's for you.
</P>
<P>
   Over years of this pattern, I've resigned myself to paying for
Christmas well into spring. Once you accept short-term debt as a
reality of a happy holiday season, it's easier to sit back and
enjoy the ride.
</P>
<P>
   And don't tell me I'm the only one who spends as much on herself
as on others. After all, you're the thoughtful shopper. You're the
one who painstakingly picks out the perfect gift for each person on
your list. But do they do the same? No. Never. Good luck getting a
single good present from any of those thugs on your Christmas list.
</P>
<P>
   So, to dull the pain of those ill-fitting sweaters, that cheap
perfume and the tacky costume jewelry, here is my holiday shopping
prescription: One for you, one for me. Think of it as a flu shot
for the Christmas-morning blues.
</P>
<P>
   All in the Family
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa: Archie McPhee, Playboy, Buy.com.
</P>
<P>
   One for him: My grandpa is one of those Depression-era humbugs
who hoards rubber bands and thinks everything I own is ``a bunch of
junk.'' Last year, for the first time ever, I actually found a
present he didn't immediately pooh-pooh: a copy of Peter Jennings'
``The Century'' ($36 at Buy.com _ Dad liked it so much he's getting
a copy this year _ at $7 less than Amazon's price). Hoping to cash
in on last year's success with Grandpa, I started with a
large-print copy of Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation''
($10.95), purchased from Buy.com, which is usually cheaper than
both Amazon ($12.48) and Barnes and Noble ($12.50).
</P>
<P>
   Then I turned to my grandpa's only other known interests: clocks
and girls. Where else but Archie McPhee (www.mcphee.com)? I chose a
Wiggling Hula Girl ($8.95) and the Sumo Clock ($19.95). And in case
the Wiggling Hula Girl didn't quite fit the bill, I threw in a
magazine subscription ($19.97/12 issues) from Playboy
(playboy.com).
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: Popping Martian Thing, Monkey in Fez, and
Monster Woman salt and pepper shakers ($7.95 each set) and a
Surprise Package ($19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: Archie McPhee throws in free gifts with every order, and
Playboy also gives some freebies with subscriptions. Bummer: I've
had some sketchy customer service from Buy.com. The prices are
really good there, but you won't get Amazon's dependability. Avoid
backordered items and you should be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Mom: Amazon, 800.com and Living Arts.
</P>
<P>
   One for her: Every family has one person held hostage by
technology. In my family, it's my mom. After nearly a decade of
trying to decipher my father's complex system of remote controls,
my mother finally gave up and now pretty much just watches the
channel that comes up when she turns on the TV. And forget about
the VCR. Even if she could decode it, good luck recording anything
on that one tape they user over and over. So when my mom expressed
an interest in my new yoga tapes, I abandoned them as a gift idea _
until I found a $179 Toshiba TV/VCR combo at Amazon.com, the last
place I looked. With simple operation (only one remote control, vs.
my father's system of three) and a compact size, she could move the
TV from her bedroom to the kitchen. Amazon also had the AM/PM Yoga
for Beginners set ($12.59). But I used a slightly lower price on
Yoga Practice for Beginners ($12.45) at 800.com as an excuse to buy
a CD I've been wanting. To complete the package: a yoga set with
mat, blocks and a strap for $44 at Living Arts
(www.livingarts.com).
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: VTech Digital Cordless Phone with handset caller
ID and answering machine ($99) from Amazon and the Flossie and the
Unicorns CD from 800.com ($11.45 _ cheaper than both Amazon and
CDNow).
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: Amazon's relatively new electronics department has great
deals. 800.com has nice prices on videos and music, plus free
shipping on some electronics and a free DVD allowance with DVD
player purchases. Living Arts offers one-stop shopping for all
things Zen: You'll find aromatherapy, meditation aids, home
accessories and wonderful back-care contraptions. Bummer: Living
Arts can be slow to notify customers of backorders.
</P>
<P>
   Dad: Outpost
</P>
<P>
   If I had my girlfriend Suzanne's dad, I'd head over to Build.com
and get him some swank new gadget or specialty power tools. Failing
that, I'd visit OmahaSteaks.com for a fancy meat pack. But my dad
always buys himself whatever he wants. I knew ``The Century'' was a
good bet, but I had to find something else cool for the pater. My
dad sells and buys a ton of stuff on eBay, so he's always uploading
images. Although he has a digital camera, I know from experience
that a low-end scanner beats the pants off a low-end camera for
small items, so I headed over to Outpost (outpost.com) and found a
scanner (several choices under $125). I also grabbed a bundle of
Zip disks ($99/10) for his new Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: a 10 mb smartcard ($84.50) for my Nikon Coolpix
950.
</P>
<P>
   Aunts: Eve
</P>
<P>
   One for her: For my aunts, BeneFit Kitten (sparkly body powder,
$22) from Eve.com, a purveyor of some of the best boutique
cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   One for me: BeneFit FakeIts Dr. Feelgood ($24).
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: Free shipping and gift wrapping makes this one of my
favorite gift sources for out-of-town friends.
</P>
<P>
   Little Cousins: Archie McPhee and American Science Surplus
</P>
<P>
   One for the kiddies: I got a few extra crowd-pleasing surprise
packs ($19.95 each) at Archie McPhee (www.mcphee.
</P>
<P>
   com). Then it was off to American Science Surplus
(www.sciplus.com), one of my favorite sites, for a whole mess of
random, strange, and quasi-scientific items. Here are a few: a set
of 40 plastic culture tubes with rack, $1.75; colorful mylar bubble
pouches, $2.25/3; square hobby dishes, $1.50/12; Cup O' Lab mug
(featuring a clear plastic compartment encasing mini test tubes,
syringe and patient chart), $1.75, and hundreds of little jars,
bottles, bags and toys for under $2. They also have about any
science kit you could think of, piles of kitchen stuff, motors and
electronic parts, model and lab materials, even a nice selection of
quality microscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Young biologists will love the Owl Pellets ($9.50/3),
regurgitated globs from the gullets of barn owls, which are both
educational and and high-scoring in the gross-out department (pick
these for the kid of your most squeamish in-law). Dissolved in
water and bleach, they'll yield an entire rodent skeleton!
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: I love any excuse to spend hours on this site.
American Science Surplus is the dim sum of the online shopping
world. The descriptions and quirky drawings are a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Godmother and her daughter: Girlshop
</P>
<P>
   For them: You'd never know my godmother was an old lady by her
accessories, so for her I headed over to Girlshop
(www.girlshop.com), a great collection of young, hip boutiques. I
picked the fuzzy hot pink checkbook wallet ($20) from the Greg
Harmon boutique for Rosemary, and an animal print version for her
equally funky daughter, Yvonne.
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: Not one to be left out, I bought myself a hot
pink one.
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: A Girlshop gift certificate means you get to shop a slew
of specialty boutiques at once. The Girlshop stores include some of
New York's hippest shops. The Bummer: It may be gorgeous, but it
ain't cheap. The wallets were definitely at the bargain end of
Girlshop's swag. On the other hand, browsing Girlshop is cheaper
than flying to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fido (or Fluffy)
</P>
<P>
   One for her: Contrary to what you might expect, shopping for the
pets doesn't have to be a selfless act. Fill Fido's stocking at
PetSmart (petsmart.com) and you'll get free pet food.
</P>
<P>
   Spend $20 on nonfood items (including treats) and get a free
small bag of dog food or a small bag or case of cat food. A $35
purchase nets you a medium bag or case. And throw down $50 on pet
gifts and get any size bag or case of dog or cat food free! Each of
les mutts got three 8'' pressed rawhide (they last longer than the
familar knotted form) bones ($1.69 each), plus a Buster Cube
($12.99) and a package of Pork Snouts ($4.99 _ they're not at all
as gross as they sound) to share. After I threw in a package of
hooves for my parents' pooch ($2.49), a smoked knuckle ($2.99) for
little Toddy, a Deluxe Crazy Grunting Rat for Nancy ($8.99), and a
few more bags of snouts and hooves for the other mutts on the list,
I had earned a big bag of dog food, which would cover December.
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: OK, so it's not exactly for you, but not having
to fork out for the pet food will make it easier for you to 1)
rationalize splurging on the pooch when you know he doesn't know
Christmas from Tuesday; 2) convince yourself you're not one of
those freaky dog people; or 3) buy yourself something nice with the
scratch you would've blown on kibble. If you're shopping for other
people's pets, take advantage of the free food and drop it off at a
local shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus: Fast delivery, no lugging bags of chow from your car
to your door, and $4.95 shipping fee regardless of the size of your
order. The bummer: Not a true bummer _ just something you should
know about the site. When you do a search or browse a category, the
sizes and prices first displayed are rarely the only choices, which
can be confusing. So if you see ``Pressed Rawhide $4.99'' or
``Nutro Natural Senior $4.79,'' go ahead and click. You'll also
find $.89, $1.49 and $6.99 bones and the larger bags of dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Friends in Need
</P>
<P>
   Girlfriend 1: Domestications
</P>
<P>
   One for her: My best friend is a minimalist, making her
impossible to shop for. But even minimalists must sleep, and I've
noticed Sue's mattress was looking a little saggy. Although I
couldn't spring for a new mattress, I figured a feather bed would
do wonders for the comfort and appearance of her bed, so I headed
to Domestications (www.domestications.com) for a really nice $99
baffled featherbed.
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: A pillow top mattress pad to perk up my shabby
old guest mattress ($19.99). I got a free pillow and $20 off the
catalog price on my item. If you're in the market for a lot of
linens, they have a buyer's club: $20 gets you 10 percent off%
everything for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Girlfriend 2: eBay and PlanetRx.com
</P>
<P>
   One for her: Another girlfriend gets a vintage trinket box ($12)
from eBay (www. ebay.com), filled with an assortment of
</P>
<P>
   M Professionals sassy nail polishes ($1.49 each) from PlanetRx
(www.planetrx.com). Darling!
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: While I was sniffing around eBay, I found a
vintage pink enameled metal Kenmore hairdryer to add to my
collection. And from PlanetRx, Healing Arts aromatherapy samplers
in lavender and tea tree ($11.87 each).
</P>
<P>
   Bonus: You can find anything on eBay, and if you become
obsessive about it (as most people do) and use restraint (as few
people do), then you can get really great prices. You could
actually fill your whole list on eBay, if you start shopping now,
stick to sellers with good ratings and pay with money orders
instead of personal checks.
</P>
<P>
   For stocking stuffers, basket stuffers, and beauty products,
PlanetRx has low prices, huge selection, great specials and great
customer service. Shipping at PlanetRx is free if you spend $30 or
fill a prescription. Bummer: While eBay's fun, it's quite easy to
get caught up in the moment and overbid. You're also depending on
individuals, rather than a company, to meet your requests. Make
sure to read the fine print so that you know exactly what you're
getting. Finally, consider the weight of the item you're bidding
on: The shipping could make it significantly more costly.
</P>
<P>
   Girlfriend 3: Kustom Girl
</P>
<P>
   One for her: For one of my more extravagant girlfriends, I chose
Kustom Girl's (www.kustomgirl.com) fabulous nail decals
($6.50/sheet) in Hot Rod (purple and red flames) and Tiger Lady
(tiger stripes). Other Kustom Girl designs sport leopard spots, old
school tattoo designs, Japanese designs and characters, and the
more demure flowers and butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: I picked up another sheet of Hot Rod.
</P>
<P>
   Boyfriend: Tiki Trader

   One for him: For my luau-loving former roommate, I staked out
Tiki Traders (www.tikitrader.com). Although the site's low-tech
(you have to e-mail or call in your order) and wouldn't win any
beauty contests, it's worth the inconvenience. For Kevin, I got a
green tiki mug and an Easter Island tiki mug ($11.95/pair), tiki
cocktail napkins ($7.75/240), and half a dozen Ropa Nui Moai Tiki
Tumblers ($17.90/dozen).
</P>
<P>
   And one for me: I kept the other half of the dozen Ropa Nui Moai
plastic tiki tumblers, plus snapped up a pair of Surfin' Wahini
mugs ($19.95/pair), a set of cocktail napkins, and some Tiki
Coasters ($7.95/eight).

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: happen faster.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computing innovation behind Blue Gene, in essence, is to
build a computer that works much as nature works _ a triumph, if it
succeeds, of marrying simplicity and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The computer scientists at IBM plan to sharply simplify the RISC
(reduced instruction-set computing) architecture used in the chips
that run engineering work stations and supercomputers today. The
``instruction set'' _ the total vocabulary of machine-language
instructions a computer understands _ will number 57 for Blue Gene,
compared with about 200 for most RISC machines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, instead of putting a single microprocessor on a chip, Blue
Gene will have 32 microprocessors _ the calculating engines of
computers _ on each chip. Sixty-four such chips will be inserted on
each motherboard, with eight motherboards in each of the 64
computing towers of Blue Gene.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, Blue Gene will stand about six feet high,
occupying a floor space of 40 feet by 40 feet at the Watson labs in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y. It will have a total of about 1 million
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the innovations computer scientists find most impressive
about Blue Gene is that IBM will place memory for storing data on
the same chip as the microprocessor. In conventional computer
designs, the memory for storage is separate from the processor.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttling data from the memory to the processor is a major
bottleneck in computers, slowing them down. Only within the last
year or so, because of advances in chip making and miniaturization,
has it become possible to consider putting memory and processing on
the same chip in the way that IBM is developing.
</P>
<P>
   To attain the speeds Blue Gene seeks within five years, IBM must
try a new architecture of computing. The conventional wisdom holds
that microprocessor speeds can theoretically double every 18
months, a phenomenon known as Moore's Law, for Gordon Moore, the
chip pioneer who first observed it. With Moore's Law, it would take
about 15 years to achieve the speed target for Blue Gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you get to where IBM is heading unless you
change today's computing architecture,'' said Arvind, a computer
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who uses
only a single name. ``It looks as if they have an outstanding
engineering plan. If they can execute it properly, it will be a
real breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Gene's speed target is a petaflop _ that is, a thousand
trillion floating point operations, or calculations, each second.
Such a speed would make the machine 500 times faster than the two
fastest supercomputers in operation today _ an IBM supercomputer at
the Lawrence Livermore national laboratory, and an Intel machine at
the Los Alamos lab.
</P>
<P>
   To translate Blue Gene's speed into a personal computer scale:
If a fast PC was represented as an inch tall, the IBM machine would
be 20 miles high.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware design of Blue Gene is innovative indeed, but the
real challenge, as is so often the case in computing, will be the
software. For in simplifying the hardware design for speed, the
complexity of protein folding is left to the software. And the
software, among other things, has to be ``self-healing'' so that
the simulation does not grind to a halt if a few processors break
down. The software must recognize the flawed processors and
re-route the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some idea how we're going to do this,'' said Marc
Snir, a senior researcher at Watson. ``But I would be lying if I
said we have solved this. We do have research to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If all the computer wizardry works as planned, it will still
take Blue Gene about a year to simulate on the computer the folding
of a single protein. How long does it take the body to fold one?
Less than a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely amazing the complexity of the problem and the
simplicity with which the body does it every day,'' Ajay Royyuru, a
researcher in IBM's computational biology center, noted.

<P>
   In a test this summer, Alexander Graethe of the European Media
Lab in Heidelberg, Germany, trudged through the rain-swept streets
of the city, asking directions from locals, with the aid of a
talking machine stashed in his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It translated his questions into German, then dictated people's
answers back to him in English. It even plotted his course on a map
display strapped to his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his colleagues booked flights and hotel rooms with
PCs, using the same software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please reserve two rooms for me at the Dom Hotel in Limburg,
Thursday to Sunday'' would come out the other end of the phone as
``Ich moechte zwei Zimmer im Dom-Hotel in Limburg bestellen, von
Donnerstag bis Sonntag.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the masterminds behind this attempt at computer
translation is Alexander Waibel, the director of Carnegie Mellon's
Interactive Systems Lab.
</P>
<P>
   His own bilingual existence, which requires shuttling back and
forth between Pittsburgh and the University of Karlsruhe in
Germany, has made him painfully aware of the difficulties involved.
The trial _ conducted in Pittsburgh; Heidelberg and Karlsruhe,
Germany; Grenoble, France; Kyoto, Japan; Trento, Italy; and Taejon,
South Korea _ was a showcase for C-STAR, an international
collaboration of researchers who are trying to get computers to
understand spoken words well enough to render them in another
language.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a small but notable step toward creating a universal
translator: a machine that allows seamless conversations between
people, or between people and machines, regardless of language or
software.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been working on machine translation for half a
century, yet only in the past few years have microchips grown
powerful enough to even approach the kind of processing human ears
and brains perform effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to do the job is called example-based
translation. It distills a few million words worth of translated
conversations into a giant set of syntax rules.
</P>
<P>
   A computer program containing those rules works like a tourist
with a phrase book, taking each word and plugging its translated
equivalent into the right place in a sentence in the target
language. The approach is crude but efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Department of Defense needed translation help
for English-speaking forces in Bosnia, Carnegie Mellon scientists
developed a rudimentary Serbo-Croatian-to-English system in a
matter of months, relying largely on example-based techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel and other researchers are exploring a more sophisticated
approach called Interlingua-based translation, which breaks down
utterances into an internal, language-neutral representation of
their meaning. Then, rather like what goes on in the head of a
multilingual person, it generates a translated sentence that says
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Interlingua requires a lot of programming skill, but it provides
a lot of flexibility in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interpretation rather than translation,'' Waibel says.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer hears ``It would please me very much if you
would be so kind as to reserve me a room in your fine hotel,'' it
extracts something like ``Reserve (object ``room'') (user ``me'')
(form polite).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the computer has captured the meaning of a sentence,
repeating it in another language may not even be necessary. If
someone has asked a question, the computer may be able to provide
an answer from its own database.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT's Laboratory for Computer Sciences, speech-recognition
expert Victor Zue is more interested in smart, voice-responsive
computers than in Waibel's Pentium-packed knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Oxygen Project, he is studying speech interfaces
that could bring a flood of computerized information to the vast
majority of the world that has yet to see PCs and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Zue predicts, people around the world may carry cheap,
souped-up cell phones that will enable them to tap into nearly
limitless networked resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the information on the Internet _ literature, news, chat
rooms, medical research _ will then be accessible to anyone who
picks up a handset and asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Before such grand changes can take place, there's a great deal
of work to be done. Current systems make a lot of mistakes when
they respond to a broad range of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Waibel says, is that people speak ``dysfluently'':
They repeat themselves, don't complete sentences and sometimes
don't even complete words.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists are striving to develop software that can
handle ``ers,'' ``umms'' and fragmentary sentences, then select
crucial words from garbled ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice interfaces also have limited vocabularies, confining
themselves to restricted subject areas in which each stage of
conversation allows only a few sensible responses.
</P>
<P>
   True conversations with computers may require overhauling the
way speech-recognition programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions range from new mathematical methods for
analyzing spoken sounds to computer programs that draw on vast
databases of abstract knowledge about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harper, who develops computer-language models at Purdue
University, points out that even human beings can hear the exact
same sounds in several different ways depending on their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are fond of the phrase ``how to wreck a nice beach''
_ or is that ``how to recognize speech''?
</P>
<P>
   Given the ambiguities of human language, she suspects it may
never be possible to craft flawless computerized representations of
what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial-intelligence expert Jack Mostow of Carnegie
Mellon contends that even severely limited language-recognition
programs can be surprisingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic interviews, which present relevant selections from a
previously filmed interview in response to spoken questions,
consistently leave interlocutors thinking they have talked to a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: Grand Illusion Studios has synthetic
interviews with sports figures on the Web at
www.grandillusionstudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   So Mostow created the Reading Tutor, a computer program that
coaches children in reading by using a variety of conversational
tricks. The software follows the child's spoken words and makes
encouraging noises to give the impression it is listening
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account how fluently or haltingly a student
speaks in addition to whether individual words are correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a small pilot study, students advanced an average of two
years in reading skills over eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Similar psychological tricks could help other imperfect
conversational systems perform better. Waibel predicts that people
will eventually be able to talk to a hodgepodge of special purpose
programs, each of which passes control to another if it recognizes
a conversation is wandering outside the bounds of its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Your digital travel agent might connect you with a news wire,
weather service or local tourist board, all using the same voice
during the same phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself, meanwhile, might be part of a voice-activated
wearable computer, with a tiny earpiece speaker and a microphone
woven into your shirt. To most observers, you'd appear to be
holding a conversation with thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Language pioneers like Waibel and Zue imagine the next
generation of kids will grow up conversing with machines as
naturally as they do with people.
</P>
<P>
   If you think today's posters, billboards and on-line ads are
intrusive, just wait. Twenty years from now, talking and listening
computers might be as ubiquitous as print is now.

By TOM HOFFARTH  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   LOS ANGELES _
Procrastinate any longer and these holiday bail-out presents won't
be delivered by Christmas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So point, click and pay. Be done with it. Pass the eggnog.
</P>
<P>
   Personal video players: We endorse TiVo (www.tivo.com) over
Replay TV (www.replaytv.com), and the $499 receiver that records 14
hours of programming should be sufficient. TiVo can also be ordered
on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite TV dish: Now with access to free network channels, the
value of DirecTV or EchoStar system (each about $129 plus
installation costs) is even alluring. An authorized DirecTV online
dealer is American Satellite &AMP; Entertainment (www.needadish.com),
which EchoStar's Dish Network setup can be had on its site
(www.dishnetwork.com).
</P>
<P>
   Video game systems: Sega DreamCast is the flavor of the
millennium ($199.99) and can be ordered on the company site
(www.sega.com) along with games (NFL 2K and NBA 2K, Bass Fishing)
and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Road trips: Through a service called Sports Travel
(www.sportstravelandtours.com), affiliated with The Sporting News,
gift certificates from $25 to $1,000 would be the way to start any
of the dozens of sports-related excursion packages.
</P>
<P>
   Personalized gloves, bats and balls: Among the items at the
Rawlings online store link (www.rawlings.com) are gloves running
$219.99; bats at $34.95 and footballs at $85.95, each stitched,
stamped or emblazoned with whatever name you choose. The Louisville
Slugger site (www.slugger.com) asks $45 for its name bats, but goes
one better _ it'll engrave an actual signature for $60.
</P>
<P>
   Gift books: More than 30 to choose from at Sports Publishing
Inc.'s site (autographedsportsbooks.com), leather-bound and signed,
sold on a first-come basis. Included is the Dodgers Encyclopedia,
signed by Manny Mota, Duke Snider, Carl Erskine and Davey Lopes,
for $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   Golf equipment: The SeeMore putter, which the late Payne Stewart
endorsed and used to win the U.S. Open, has a site
(www.seemore.com) that handles orders and helps determine the right
size. All mallet models are out of stock, however. Price: $129.95.
</P>
<P>
   There are also several clever packages on Golfballs.com
(www.golfballs.com), including one called the ``illegal gift set''
($22.95) that all-but-guarantees to improve distance off the tee.
Wrapping included.
</P>
<P>
   General sporting goods: Hundreds are out there, but we'd check
out Direct Sports (www.directsports.com) or Wilson sports' site
(www.wilsonsuperstore.com) for starters. Also, at WhatsHotNow
(www.whatshotnow.com), specializing in pop-culture items, the
sports link has a top-10 list of stuff ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Calendars: Half the proceeds to the $14.95 Track Girls 2000
calendar (www.vaultstuff.com) goes to the Florence Griffith-Joyner
Community Empowerment Foundation. So the tastefully done
black-and-white photos of naked female track stars like UCLA high
jumper Amy Acuff are worthy of the effort. Amazon.com also has some
10,000 calendars to pick from, specifically ones dedicated to Heidi
Klum ($12.99), Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit models ($12.99), the
Swedish Bikini Team ($12.95) and, soon, the Australian women's
soccer team. Again, a nude calendar.

   &UR; MICROSCOPE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electron microscopes are murder on their subjects, because the
devices work only in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of California at San Diego
have developed a more tender way to study tiny life.
</P>
<P>
   In the new system, an intense but harmless laser burst
illuminates the specimen _ such as this bit of algae, just 1/250
inch wide. Atoms in the specimen resonate in response to the laser
and generate a pulse of light.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping a laser through the algae and plotting the return
signals, scientists crafted this detailed image without creating
laboratory carnage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOSE-BOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many of his colleagues work on robots that can see, Andy
Russell, an electrical engineer at Monash University in Australia,
realized that a sense of smell could be helpful to robots as well,
allowing them to navigate along scent trails like ants leading
comrades to food.
</P>
<P>
   After a lead ant marks the path, a follower picks out the
aromatic marker with its antennae. When the left antenna hits the
trail, the ant turns until the right antenna picks it up, and so
forth. Russell's robots follow paths using the same method.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines that an odor detector could tell a troop of robots
where they have been, useful for sweeping for land mines or mopping
a floor. And a robotic explorer could blaze a trail for cheaper,
simpler followers _ for mineral prospecting or even planetary
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETURN TO THE FORGOTTEN PLANET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is an enigma _ moonlike on the outside, Earth-like on
the inside, hotter than molten lead yet possibly capped with water
ice.
</P>
<P>
   What little we know about the planet closest to the sun comes
from Mariner 10, which observed less than half of its surface in
1974 and 1975. But NASA is working on a return trip that should
answer a lot of lingering questions.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip has been a long time in the making because
Mercury is a tough target. It orbits just 36 million miles from the
sun, where intense solar gravity makes spacecraft visits difficult,
and fierce heat challenges spacecraft designers.
</P>
<P>
   The $286 million Messenger spacecraft, set for launch in 2004,
will benefit from a sun-blocking parasol and a loopy path that will
fly it several times by Venus and Mercury and then ease it into
orbit around Mercury in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Messenger will study Mercury's strangely dense
interior and strong magnetic field, reminiscent of Earth's. The
probe will also look for ice at Mercury's poles, where shadowed
craters remain frigid even when equatorial temperatures soar to 800
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury gives us the best chance to learn why Earth is unlike
Mars and Venus, why our planet is special,'' says Sean Solomon of
the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., who leads the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO FLY LIKE A FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary housefly performs wing strokes so complex that
conventional aerodynamics theory can't explain how it gets off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So Michael Dickinson of the University of California, Berkeley,
built a scaled-up set of mechanical wings that have at last
revealed how flies stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Flies flap their wings forward, then flip them over so the
leading edges point to the rear before flapping them back again.
Dickinson observed that the rotation of the wings speeds air over
them and provides extra lift.
</P>
<P>
   When the wings shift to the backward stroke, they also travel
through the faster-moving air from the forward stroke, which acts
like a head wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really spiffy mechanism, because the insect
recaptures energy it lost to the air,'' Dickinson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHINA'S ON FIRE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep beneath the rugged terrain of northern China, flames are
gnawing their way through the country's extensive coalfields.
</P>
<P>
   While the world focuses its attention on more visible crises,
China's underground fires are quietly consuming up to 200 million
tons of coal each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fires spew nearly as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
as do all the cars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John van Genderen, a geomorphologist at the International
Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences in the
Netherlands, is leading an international high-tech counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Heat measurements from satellites, airplanes and ground-based
detectors have been combined to determine the size and depth of the
fires and which direction they are burning.
</P>
<P>
   Some fires started naturally by lightning or spontaneous
combustion, others as a result of coal mining.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, extinguishing the smoldering coal is a laborious
process. Chinese workers suffocate surface fires by burying them
under a three-foot layer of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper fires, some of which have persisted for centuries, are
more difficult. Quenching them with water can produce explosive
methane fumes, so engineers pour a water-clay slurry into cracks
created by the heat of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Even after treatment, the ground can take several years to cool
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``These coal fires weren't given due attention in the past,''
says Anupma Prakash, a thermal remote-sensing expert who works with
van Genderen at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Chinese partners, Prakash has helped alert the
Chinese government to the magnitude of the problem, but he
recognizes that nature has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting out all the fires in one go is not possible. Sometimes
it is more feasible to isolate the fire and let it burn,'' he says.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In a test this summer, Alexander Graethe of the European Media
Lab in Heidelberg, Germany, trudged through the rain-swept streets
of the city, asking directions from locals, with the aid of a
talking machine stashed in his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It translated his questions into German, then dictated people's
answers back to him in English. It even plotted his course on a map
display strapped to his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his colleagues booked flights and hotel rooms with
PCs, using the same software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please reserve two rooms for me at the Dom Hotel in Limburg,
Thursday to Sunday'' would come out the other end of the phone as
``Ich moechte zwei Zimmer im Dom-Hotel in Limburg bestellen, von
Donnerstag bis Sonntag.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the masterminds behind this attempt at computer
translation is Alexander Waibel, the director of Carnegie Mellon's
Interactive Systems Lab.
</P>
<P>
   His own bilingual existence, which requires shuttling back and
forth between Pittsburgh and the University of Karlsruhe in
Germany, has made him painfully aware of the difficulties involved.
The trial _ conducted in Pittsburgh; Heidelberg and Karlsruhe,
Germany; Grenoble, France; Kyoto, Japan; Trento, Italy; and Taejon,
South Korea _ was a showcase for C-STAR, an international
collaboration of researchers who are trying to get computers to
understand spoken words well enough to render them in another
language.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a small but notable step toward creating a universal
translator: a machine that allows seamless conversations between
people, or between people and machines, regardless of language or
software.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have been working on machine translation for half a
century, yet only in the past few years have microchips grown
powerful enough to even approach the kind of processing human ears
and brains perform effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to do the job is called example-based
translation. It distills a few million words worth of translated
conversations into a giant set of syntax rules.
</P>
<P>
   A computer program containing those rules works like a tourist
with a phrase book, taking each word and plugging its translated
equivalent into the right place in a sentence in the target
language. The approach is crude but efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Department of Defense needed translation help
for English-speaking forces in Bosnia, Carnegie Mellon scientists
developed a rudimentary Serbo-Croatian-to-English system in a
matter of months, relying largely on example-based techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel and other researchers are exploring a more sophisticated
approach called Interlingua-based translation, which breaks down
utterances into an internal, language-neutral representation of
their meaning. Then, rather like what goes on in the head of a
multilingual person, it generates a translated sentence that says
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Interlingua requires a lot of programming skill, but it provides
a lot of flexibility in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interpretation rather than translation,'' Waibel says.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer hears ``It would please me very much if you
would be so kind as to reserve me a room in your fine hotel,'' it
extracts something like ``Reserve (object ``room'') (user ``me'')
(form polite).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the computer has captured the meaning of a sentence,
repeating it in another language may not even be necessary. If
someone has asked a question, the computer may be able to provide
an answer from its own database.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT's Laboratory for Computer Sciences, speech-recognition
expert Victor Zue is more interested in smart, voice-responsive
computers than in Waibel's Pentium-packed knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Oxygen Project, he is studying speech interfaces
that could bring a flood of computerized information to the vast
majority of the world that has yet to see PCs and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Zue predicts, people around the world may carry cheap,
souped-up cell phones that will enable them to tap into nearly
limitless networked resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the information on the Internet _ literature, news, chat
rooms, medical research _ will then be accessible to anyone who
picks up a handset and asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Before such grand changes can take place, there's a great deal
of work to be done. Current systems make a lot of mistakes when
they respond to a broad range of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Waibel says, is that people speak ``dysfluently'':
They repeat themselves, don't complete sentences and sometimes
don't even complete words.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists are striving to develop software that can
handle ``ers,'' ``umms'' and fragmentary sentences, then select
crucial words from garbled ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice interfaces also have limited vocabularies, confining
themselves to restricted subject areas in which each stage of
conversation allows only a few sensible responses.
</P>
<P>
   True conversations with computers may require overhauling the
way speech-recognition programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions range from new mathematical methods for
analyzing spoken sounds to computer programs that draw on vast
databases of abstract knowledge about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harper, who develops computer-language models at Purdue
University, points out that even human beings can hear the exact
same sounds in several different ways depending on their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are fond of the phrase ``how to wreck a nice beach''
_ or is that ``how to recognize speech''?
</P>
<P>
   Given the ambiguities of human language, she suspects it may
never be possible to craft flawless computerized representations of
what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial-intelligence expert Jack Mostow of Carnegie
Mellon contends that even severely limited language-recognition
programs can be surprisingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic interviews, which present relevant selections from a
previously filmed interview in response to spoken questions,
consistently leave interlocutors thinking they have talked to a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: Grand Illusion Studios has synthetic
interviews with sports figures on the Web at
www.grandillusionstudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   So Mostow created the Reading Tutor, a computer program that
coaches children in reading by using a variety of conversational
tricks. The software follows the child's spoken words and makes
encouraging noises to give the impression it is listening
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account how fluently or haltingly a student
speaks in addition to whether individual words are correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a small pilot study, students advanced an average of two
years in reading skills over eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Similar psychological tricks could help other imperfect
conversational systems perform better. Waibel predicts that people
will eventually be able to talk to a hodgepodge of special purpose
programs, each of which passes control to another if it recognizes
a conversation is wandering outside the bounds of its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Your digital travel agent might connect you with a news wire,
weather service or local tourist board, all using the same voice
during the same phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself, meanwhile, might be part of a voice-activated
wearable computer, with a tiny earpiece speaker and a microphone
woven into your shirt. To most observers, you'd appear to be
holding a conversation with thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Language pioneers like Waibel and Zue imagine the next
generation of kids will grow up conversing with machines as
naturally as they do with people.
</P>
<P>
   If you think today's posters, billboards and on-line ads are
intrusive, just wait. Twenty years from now, talking and listening
computers might be as ubiquitous as print is now.

<P>
   One simple way to do the job is called example-based
translation. It distills a few million words worth of translated
conversations into a giant set of syntax rules.
</P>
<P>
   A computer program containing those rules works like a tourist
with a phrase book, taking each word and plugging its translated
equivalent into the right place in a sentence in the target
language. The approach is crude but efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Department of Defense needed translation help
for English-speaking forces in Bosnia, Carnegie Mellon scientists
developed a rudimentary Serbo-Croatian-to-English system in a
matter of months, relying largely on example-based techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Waibel and other researchers are exploring a more sophisticated
approach called Interlingua-based translation, which breaks down
utterances into an internal, language-neutral representation of
their meaning. Then, rather like what goes on in the head of a
multilingual person, it generates a translated sentence that says
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Interlingua requires a lot of programming skill, but it provides
a lot of flexibility in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interpretation rather than translation,'' Waibel says.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer hears ``It would please me very much if you
would be so kind as to reserve me a room in your fine hotel,'' it
extracts something like ``Reserve (object ``room'') (user ``me'')
(form polite).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the computer has captured the meaning of a sentence,
repeating it in another language may not even be necessary. If
someone has asked a question, the computer may be able to provide
an answer from its own database.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT's Laboratory for Computer Sciences, speech-recognition
expert Victor Zue is more interested in smart, voice-responsive
computers than in Waibel's Pentium-packed knapsacks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Oxygen Project, he is studying speech interfaces
that could bring a flood of computerized information to the vast
majority of the world that has yet to see PCs and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Zue predicts, people around the world may carry cheap,
souped-up cell phones that will enable them to tap into nearly
limitless networked resources.
</P>
<P>
   All the information on the Internet _ literature, news, chat
rooms, medical research _ will then be accessible to anyone who
picks up a handset and asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   Before such grand changes can take place, there's a great deal
of work to be done. Current systems make a lot of mistakes when
they respond to a broad range of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Waibel says, is that people speak ``dysfluently'':
They repeat themselves, don't complete sentences and sometimes
don't even complete words.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists are striving to develop software that can
handle ``ers,'' ``umms'' and fragmentary sentences, then select
crucial words from garbled ramblings.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice interfaces also have limited vocabularies, confining
themselves to restricted subject areas in which each stage of
conversation allows only a few sensible responses.
</P>
<P>
   True conversations with computers may require overhauling the
way speech-recognition programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Possible solutions range from new mathematical methods for
analyzing spoken sounds to computer programs that draw on vast
databases of abstract knowledge about the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harper, who develops computer-language models at Purdue
University, points out that even human beings can hear the exact
same sounds in several different ways depending on their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are fond of the phrase ``how to wreck a nice beach''
_ or is that ``how to recognize speech''?
</P>
<P>
   Given the ambiguities of human language, she suspects it may
never be possible to craft flawless computerized representations of
what we mean.
</P>
<P>
   But artificial-intelligence expert Jack Mostow of Carnegie
Mellon contends that even severely limited language-recognition
programs can be surprisingly smart.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic interviews, which present relevant selections from a
previously filmed interview in response to spoken questions,
consistently leave interlocutors thinking they have talked to a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   Judge for yourself: Grand Illusion Studios has synthetic
interviews with sports figures on the Web at
www.grandillusionstudios.com.
</P>
<P>
   So Mostow created the Reading Tutor, a computer program that
coaches children in reading by using a variety of conversational
tricks. The software follows the child's spoken words and makes
encouraging noises to give the impression it is listening
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes into account how fluently or haltingly a student
speaks in addition to whether individual words are correct.
</P>
<P>
   In a small pilot study, students advanced an average of two
years in reading skills over eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Similar psychological tricks could help other imperfect
conversational systems perform better. Waibel predicts that people
will eventually be able to talk to a hodgepodge of special purpose
programs, each of which passes control to another if it recognizes
a conversation is wandering outside the bounds of its expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Your digital travel agent might connect you with a news wire,
weather service or local tourist board, all using the same voice
during the same phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The phone itself, meanwhile, might be part of a voice-activated
wearable computer, with a tiny earpiece speaker and a microphone
woven into your shirt. To most observers, you'd appear to be
holding a conversation with thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Language pioneers like Waibel and Zue imagine the next
generation of kids will grow up conversing with machines as
naturally as they do with people.
</P>
<P>
   If you think today's posters, billboards and on-line ads are
intrusive, just wait. Twenty years from now, talking and listening
computers might be as ubiquitous as print is now.

   &UR; MICROSCOPE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Electron microscopes are murder on their subjects, because the
devices work only in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at the University of California at San Diego
have developed a more tender way to study tiny life.
</P>
<P>
   In the new system, an intense but harmless laser burst
illuminates the specimen _ such as this bit of algae, just 1/250
inch wide. Atoms in the specimen resonate in response to the laser
and generate a pulse of light.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping a laser through the algae and plotting the return
signals, scientists crafted this detailed image without creating
laboratory carnage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOSE-BOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While many of his colleagues work on robots that can see, Andy
Russell, an electrical engineer at Monash University in Australia,
realized that a sense of smell could be helpful to robots as well,
allowing them to navigate along scent trails like ants leading
comrades to food.
</P>
<P>
   After a lead ant marks the path, a follower picks out the
aromatic marker with its antennae. When the left antenna hits the
trail, the ant turns until the right antenna picks it up, and so
forth. Russell's robots follow paths using the same method.
</P>
<P>
   He imagines that an odor detector could tell a troop of robots
where they have been, useful for sweeping for land mines or mopping
a floor. And a robotic explorer could blaze a trail for cheaper,
simpler followers _ for mineral prospecting or even planetary
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RETURN TO THE FORGOTTEN PLANET &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is an enigma _ moonlike on the outside, Earth-like on
the inside, hotter than molten lead yet possibly capped with water
ice.
</P>
<P>
   What little we know about the planet closest to the sun comes
from Mariner 10, which observed less than half of its surface in
1974 and 1975. But NASA is working on a return trip that should
answer a lot of lingering questions.
</P>
<P>
   The return trip has been a long time in the making because
Mercury is a tough target. It orbits just 36 million miles from the
sun, where intense solar gravity makes spacecraft visits difficult,
and fierce heat challenges spacecraft designers.
</P>
<P>
   The $286 million Messenger spacecraft, set for launch in 2004,
will benefit from a sun-blocking parasol and a loopy path that will
fly it several times by Venus and Mercury and then ease it into
orbit around Mercury in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Messenger will study Mercury's strangely dense
interior and strong magnetic field, reminiscent of Earth's. The
probe will also look for ice at Mercury's poles, where shadowed
craters remain frigid even when equatorial temperatures soar to 800
degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercury gives us the best chance to learn why Earth is unlike
Mars and Venus, why our planet is special,'' says Sean Solomon of
the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., who leads the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO FLY LIKE A FLY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary housefly performs wing strokes so complex that
conventional aerodynamics theory can't explain how it gets off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So Michael Dickinson of the University of California, Berkeley,
built a scaled-up set of mechanical wings that have at last
revealed how flies stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Flies flap their wings forward, then flip them over so the
leading edges point to the rear before flapping them back again.
Dickinson observed that the rotation of the wings speeds air over
them and provides extra lift.
</P>
<P>
   When the wings shift to the backward stroke, they also travel
through the faster-moving air from the forward stroke, which acts
like a head wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really spiffy mechanism, because the insect
recaptures energy it lost to the air,'' Dickinson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHINA'S ON FIRE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deep beneath the rugged terrain of northern China, flames are
gnawing their way through the country's extensive coalfields.
</P>
<P>
   While the world focuses its attention on more visible crises,
China's underground fires are quietly consuming up to 200 million
tons of coal each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fires spew nearly as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
as do all the cars in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John van Genderen, a geomorphologist at the International
Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences in the
Netherlands, is leading an international high-tech counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Heat measurements from satellites, airplanes and ground-based
detectors have been combined to determine the size and depth of the
fires and which direction they are burning.
</P>
<P>
   Some fires started naturally by lightning or spontaneous
combustion, others as a result of coal mining.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, extinguishing the smoldering coal is a laborious
process. Chinese workers suffocate surface fires by burying them
under a three-foot layer of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper fires, some of which have persisted for centuries, are
more difficult. Quenching them with water can produce explosive
methane fumes, so engineers pour a water-clay slurry into cracks
created by the heat of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Even after treatment, the ground can take several years to cool
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``These coal fires weren't given due attention in the past,''
says Anupma Prakash, a thermal remote-sensing expert who works with
van Genderen at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Chinese partners, Prakash has helped alert the
Chinese government to the magnitude of the problem, but he
recognizes that nature has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting out all the fires in one go is not possible. Sometimes
it is more feasible to isolate the fire and let it burn,'' he says.

EXCLUSIVE: IBM PLANS SUPERCOMPUTER THAT WORKS AT SPEED OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas)  (See also COMPUTERCHIP-CONFERENCE) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, when an IBM supercomputer known as Deep Blue beat
the world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, it seemed a confirmation
of the Computer Age, a triumph of machine over man. On Monday, IBM
is announcing a five-year, $100-million program to build a
supercomputer whose ambitions dwarf Deep Blue's.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new supercomputer, to be called Blue Gene, is to
simulate one of the most common routines in natural biology _ the
process by which amino acids intricately fold themselves into
full-fledged proteins, the body's molecular work force whose chores
range from metabolizing food to fighting disease.
</P>
<P>
   Protein folding may be routine, but it is a routine of enormous
complexity. To simulate the process is beyond the reach of
contemporary computing. To meet the challenge, Blue Gene is being
built to run 500 times faster than the world's fastest
supercomputer today, by using an innovative design that seeks to
sharply accelerate the already torrid rate at which the speed of
computers improves.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the IBM project would not only be a breakthrough
in cutting-edge computing, but would also help supply fundamental
insights into the basic physics and chemistry of biology, opening
the door to a new understanding of diseases and more effective
drugs, perhaps ones individually tailored to a person's genetic
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly financed human genome project, an international
research initiative begun in 1990 with the goal of deciphering all
of the human genetic code by 2005, is already generating a huge
quantity of biological data for computation. IBM's Blue Gene
program is, in a sense, an effort to take the next step _ feeding
the genetic data into a supercomputer to try to understand basic
biological processes.
</P>
<P>
   Computer scientists and biologists who have been briefed in
advance of Monday's announcement are impressed by the ambition and
promise of the IBM effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of all the ideas that IBM is putting together
to make a supercomputer on this scale is really exciting,'' said
Ken Kennedy, a computer scientist at Rice University who is
co-chairman of the President's Information Technology Advisory
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there will be a lot more benefit to society from this
project than there was from having Deep Blue beat Kasparov in
chess,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists and medical experts say the broadest impact of the
IBM research, at least during the next few years, will likely come
from its contribution to improving the field of computer
simulations of molecular biology in general, rather than the
``grand challenge'' of protein folding itself. It is expected to
take five years before Blue Gene is ready to begin the marathon
simulations of protein folding.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, biological researchers have used
computer simulations to study the activity of proteins in the body
_ how drugs bind to proteins, for example, or how cell membranes
absorb some substances while screening out others.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to run faster, longer and better simulations of more
modest molecular mysteries than protein folding could have big
health-care payoffs in understanding ailments like heart disease
and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of what IBM is doing is far beyond the one
machine,'' said Bernard Brooks, a principal investigator at the
National Institutes of Health and a leading expert in computer
simulations of molecular biology. ``The really important work that
can be done with this technology is in smaller-scale simulations
rather than the demonstration project of protein folding.''
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, Blue Gene is a research program of its renowned Watson
Labs. But it is the expected trickle-down of research knowledge
into commercial uses that justifies the company's $100 million
investment on Blue Gene.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-1998, IBM has jumped from third in supercomputer
installations worldwide, after the Cray division of Silicon
Graphics and Sun Microsystems, to the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, IBM has nearly doubled its share of the 500 most
powerful machines, from 75 to 141 last month, according to ``The
Top 500 Supercomputing Sites,'' a list compiled by three academic
supercomputer experts. At the same time, the number of
installations for Cray fell sharply while Sun Microsystems held
steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in our mind that a lot of that improvement
is because of what we learned with Deep Blue,'' said Paul Horn,
senior vice president of research. ``The payoff can be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Several IBM supercomputers are already at work on the human
genome project worldwide, including one that is host to one of the
project's central databases in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday, just as the project is getting under
way, is also clearly an image-burnishing step by IBM, intended to
emphasize its commitment to supercomputing and to research. Blue
Gene, experts agree, is a multidisciplinary endeavor requiring not
only computer hardware, software and manufacturing expertise but
also mathematicians, biologists, chemists and physicists.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Blue Gene project should serve as a kind of
recruiting tool for IBM research _ and perhaps serve as a venture
that could lift the stature of computer-science research in
general. Such a lift, according to Kennedy of Rice University, is
badly needed. Computer talent, to be sure, has perhaps never been
in such great demand as it is today. Yet the excitement of Internet
start-ups and the lure of stock options, Kennedy notes, has meant
that computer-science students increasingly shun graduate studies
and advanced research.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few projects like this could re-establish research
institutions _ academic or corporate _ as centers of excitement in
computing,'' Kennedy said. ``It's going to bring some of those
minds back.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The frontier of computational biology is certainly a field that
can stir excitement in the research community as well as hold out
the promise of being a huge industry someday. In the last few
years, IBM has built a 30-person team of researchers in
computational biology.
</P>
<P>
   IBM hopes its supercomputer project will stimulate the field.
``We want to attract significant interest and involvement from
university researchers and from the scientific community in
general,'' Dr. Sharon Nunes, a senior research manager, said. ``If
we can influence this fundamental research, it will happen
faster.''

down.

   ``These coal fires weren't given due attention in the past,''
says Anupma Prakash, a thermal remote-sensing expert who works with
van Genderen at the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Chinese partners, Prakash has helped alert the
Chinese government to the magnitude of the problem, but he
recognizes that nature has the upper hand.

   ``Putting out all the fires in one go is not possible. Sometimes
it is more feasible to isolate the fire and let it burn,'' he says.

   Remember last year, when the gift you got your teen was the gift
he or she really wanted _ the year before? This Christmas, be ahead
of the curve: Get something the teen in your life may not yet know
he (or she) wants _ but will soon! Here are some ideas:
 &UR; FOR HER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ STICKER JEWELRY: Less painful than tattoos, less permanent
than Mehndi and less expensive than a trip to the jeweler, these
bracelets, necklaces and earrings make great gifts. Teens today are
very much into self-expression and individualism, and sticker
jewelry gives them a chance to make a statement _ without making a
lifetime commitment. Just stick on a few pieces _ wherever _ and
go. (They peel off just as easily.)
</P>
<P>
   Where to get it: Express stores nationwide for $13-$20.

ADVANCES IN MINIATURIZATION IS THEME OF COMPUTER INDUSTRY 
CONCLAVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (See also IBM-FUTURE) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer-chip researchers are gathering for an industry conclave
in Washington this week, where a range of technical presentations
are expected to revive the recently flagging spirits of the
semiconductor community.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements planned by IBM, Lucent's Bell Laboratories,
Motorola, the University of California at Berkeley and other
research laboratories at the International Electron Device Meeting
suggest that researchers are finding ways to accelerate the speed
at which chip makers can further shrink the size of the microscopic
transistors that are the basic component of microelectronic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the advances is significant now, since a number of
prominent semiconductor researchers have been expressing concerns
that the industry might be approaching fundamental physical limits
that would curtail chip development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important because in the last five years there has
been a doomsday feeling among semiconductor researchers,'' said
Chenming Hu, a University of California at Berkeley electrical
engineering professor. A research team led by Hu will present a
paper detailing a new kind of transistor that the research team
believes can be scaled down to just 18 nanometers _ or about the
width of 100 atoms. That would be about one-twentieth the size of
today's smallest transistors.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley researchers predict that the new transistor design
could lead to devices that store 400 times as much data as today's
densest memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   While such a transistor might not be common for another decade,
the Berkeley announcement indicates that it might be possible to
extend the future of microscopic semiconductor circuitry well
beyond the year 2014, when some researchers have been predicting
that the technology would meet its theoretical limits.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, the chip industry has operated under an
assumption that had proved so reliable that it is known as Moore's
Law _ named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who had observed
that the number of transistors that chip makers could fit on a
given piece of silicon was doubling every 18 months. But recently,
even Moore himself has warned that the growth rate was coming at
such spiraling costs that Moore's Law might no longer be
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   This week's meeting, however, may indicate that the circuiteers
have made new breakthroughs in their quest for the infinitesimal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the Berkeley announcements describe advances
that may not have any immediate application, IBM researchers will
present a series of papers detailing advances in transistors and
materials that are to become available soon in the company's
commercial products, while having a potentially far-reaching impact
on future designs.
</P>
<P>
   A group of IBM researchers, in cooperation with researchers from
Infineon Technologies Corp., will report on a new kind of vertical
transistor _ a sort of semiconductor high-rise architecture that
will make it possible to build elaborate composite chips that will
stack computing logic circuits on top of memory circuits within the
same chip design. Today's chip designs typically lay out such
circuits in relatively sprawling one-story, low-rise
configurations.
</P>
<P>
   The stackable design could circumvent the so-called
``processor-to-memory'' delays that are the most significant
limiting factor in the design of high-speed computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get faster and faster processors it becomes crucial to
get memory close to the processor,'' said Richard Doherty,
president of Envisioneering, an industry consulting firm in
Seaford, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives said the new technology could conceivably spawn a
renaissance in computer design.
</P>
<P>
   IBM will also report on a new complementary metal oxide
semiconductor, or CMOS, chip-making technology that the company
says should pave the way for a generation of microprocessors that
will reach computing speeds above a billion operations a second.
The new technology is based on a relatively new kind of
manufacturing process known as silicon-on-insulator, which offers
higher speeds and lower power consumption than conventional
silicon-based CMOS chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not state specific product dates but said it
generally makes such technology announcements a year to 18 months
before products are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Motorola Laboratories have developed a new class
of materials known as perovskites (pronounced per-AHV-skights) that
will permit a new class of transistors.
</P>
<P>
   Perovskites are a class of crystalline oxide materials with
singular material properties that may prove preferable to the
conventional silicon dioxides that have long been used as
insulating materials on chips.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's industry meeting, the greatest excitement
surrounded the use of copper wires as an alternative to the
traditional aluminum wires in semiconductor chips _ a development
that allows for higher speeds at lower power consumption. Now, the
introduction of new materials and chip-making processes like
silicon-on-insulator suggest that scientists may have found another
way to make great strides in chip circuit density and performance.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's meeting, molecular computing researchers are
scheduled to announce development of a memory device no larger than
a single molecule. Researchers have been making great strides this
year, and they say that their work points to a path for the
computing devices that will be needed once conventional
lithographic chip-making processes begin to fail. Lithography is a
means for etching circuitry onto chip surfaces.

SOFTWARE ON TRIAL IN MARS MISSION  
 A DOT-COM TAKES AIM AT THE MARKET FOR GREEN POWER  
 A PET SITE THAT WANTS TO KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR DOG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the ultimate field test: The temperature was minus 75 and
the terrain was entirely unfamiliar. And with a $165 million NASA
mission at stake, there was no room for errors _ or even error
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the luxury of rebooting,'' said Curt Shacker,
vice president of marketing at Wind River Systems, a software
company based in Alameda, Calif., that supplied the operating
system for the Mars Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   After a trip that took 11 months, the spacecraft was to have
landed on Mars last Friday and sent an electronic message back to
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to confirm its
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a silence that continued through late Sunday
afternoon, with NASA mission control and Wind River officials
playing a tense waiting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got signals that the operating system was performing as it
should have,'' said John Fogelin, vice president of engineering.
``The frustrating thing is, if we don't establish contact, we may
never know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind River's Vx Works, a commercially available computer
operating system, is acting as the brains of the lander,
controlling its various arms and collection devices and
transmitting data back to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The program is embedded on an IBM microprocessor, just as it was
in the Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wind River said NASA selected Vx Works because of its
reliability and compactness (its code fills only a fourth of a
floppy disk), and because modifying commercial products is cheaper
than creating one's own.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for all the participants. Exploration of the
planet has been studded with technical failures.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks ago, for example, the $125 million Mars Climate
Orbiter, a sibling of the Polar Lander, burned up in the planet's
atmosphere because of a failure to convert navigation data from
feet and inches into metric units. (The orbiter was also using the
Wind River operating system, but the disaster was caused by human
error, company officials want to make clear.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Mars mission is only a small part of Wind River's
business, Shacker says. Currently, Vx Works is the control center
for digital cameras and other consumer products. Telephone and
other communications companies use it to program chips for network
equipment, and Wind River's future emphasis will be on extending
Internet capabilities to pagers, hand-held computers and new types
of data phones.
</P>
<P>
   So does this past weekend's uncertainty curb Wind River's
appetite for space expeditions? ``We're obviously very upset,''
Fogelin said. ``But we have no interest in backing off. It's too
much fun.''

   A Dot-Com Takes Aim at the Market for Green Power
</P>
<P>
   Add another product to the lengthening list of things you can
buy with a mouse click. Now it's green energy: power derived from
windmills, solar panels, anything that does not pollute the air.
</P>
<P>
   GreenMountain.com plays middleman between wind farms _ and other
clean sources of electricity _ and consumers who want to feel
guilt-free when they flick an electric switch.
</P>
<P>
   Its business plan is based on the premise that, given a choice,
consumers and businesses will want to buy electricity that was
generated in environmentally sound ways.
</P>
<P>
   And energy deregulation, which mandates that local utilities
will have to deliver power from competing sources across their
existing grids, is now making that choice possible.
</P>
<P>
   So far, GreenMountain.com, although based in South Burlington,
Vt., operates only in Pennsylvania and California, which were among
the first states to embrace deregulation. But it has its eye on New
Jersey for next year, and is ready to mount marketing blitzes as
other states deregulate.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the dot-com label, which the company adopted last year,
changing its name from Green Mountain Energy Resources. It wants to
do most of its selling, billing and customer communication through
its Web site, and the old name did not create the visceral pull
that prompts customers to log on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to signal that we are a modern company that's using
the most efficient and environmentally friendly means to do all our
business,'' Dennis Kelly, the company's chief executive, said.

   A Pet Site That Wants to Know All About Your Dog
</P>
<P>
   Consumers wary of the information that Web sites gather about
them have one more reason to lose sleep: An Internet company now
wants to compile dossiers on their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   PogoPet.com, which rolled out last week, is the latest entrant
in the increasingly cluttered category of pet Web sites. The
difference between this venture and its competitors, company
executives say, is that PogoPet will compile personal data on a pet
owner's dog or cat and use it to deliver information tailored to
that pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Labrador, and I sometimes forget to administer
heartworm pills, and I feel a lot of anxiety and guilt about it,''
said Stacey Estrella, PogoPet's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Estrella said the site, which serves only dog and cat
owners, would ease such worries by sending e-mail reminders about a
pet's medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to avail themselves of such services, consumers must
first provide some information, including the age, breed and
favorite activities of the pets.
</P>
<P>
   PogoPet never shares personally identifiable data about a user's
pets with others, Ms. Estrella said. It will instead deliver
advertisements on behalf of marketers while keeping the user's
identity secret.
</P>
<P>
   It is a policy that will doubtlessly go far to placate owners _
not to mention some dogs who may not want to go public with that
pesky halitosis problem.

A SOFTWARE ENFORCER FOR E-COMMERCE

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By SARA ROBINSON c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The market for selling merchandise over the Internet _
everything from books and CDs to groceries and Pokemon toys _ is
already well established as ``e-tailers'' head into what is
expected to be a pivotal holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts expect that 2000 will see huge growth in
another kind of electronic commerce _ all-digital products like
documents, recorded music and videos that exist only as computer
files and are delivered directly from a Web site to the consumer's
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan Securities, for one, predicts that the market for
digital content will reach $275 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   One company well positioned to capitalize on that market is
InterTrust Technologies Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., whose initial
public offering in October was one of the year's hot Internet
issues. The company specializes in technology that protects the
copyrights of digital content by preventing illegal copying. It
also tracks the material's distribution and manages the finances
involved in buying and selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Although InterTrust's products are still in the testing phase,
the company already has deals with media heavyweights like the
largest record company, Seagram's Universal Music Group, and the
storage media division of Bertelsmann AG, which manufactures CDs.
Both have agreed to use InterTrust software to protect various
kinds of digital material from being illegally copied.
</P>
<P>
   And its deals with content providers have led to complementary
agreements with companies like MusicMatch, Diamond Multimedia and
Creative Labs that sell technology for playing music on
computerized devices.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, much of the demand for InterTrust's products has been
driven by the recording industry, whose urgent concerns about music
piracy on the Internet led to the formation early this year of the
Secure Digital Music Initiative. SDMI aims to produce universal
standards for preventing the pirating of digital music, and it says
it will not endorse any single proprietary technology. Even so,
InterTrust is an active member of SDMI, and its technology is
widely expected to play a leading role in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, InterTrust faces stiff competition. The company's
activities in the digital music market, for example, put it on a
collision course with other popular music-management technologies,
including Liquid Audio, and with Microsoft's Windows Media Audio
compression format.
</P>
<P>
   In the document-publishing market, InterTrust will be bumping up
against giants like Xerox, which has introduced a digital-rights
management system based on Java, and Hewlett-Packard, which plans
its own document-management effort. And several niche companies
have developed their own protection schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But Victor Shear, InterTrust's chief executive, predicts that
his company's broad array of patents, coupled with its focus solely
on digital-rights management, will enable it to take on all comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an area that requires a huge amount of single-minded
focus,'' Shear said. ``Having it as a side project or add-ons or
dependent on other agendas will not allow for an efficient
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, InterTrust derives power from its partnerships, as
indicated by the contracts with Bertelsmann and Universal. Each
company has promised to designate InterTrust's products as its
preferred digital-rights management technology and to promote its
adoption by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals ``put it in position to dominate the digital
distribution space for the major labels,'' Aram Sinnreich, an
analyst at Jupiter Communications, said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Such prospects might seem unusual, given that InterTrust's
products have yet to be tested in the marketplace. But InterTrust's
partners say its technology is particularly attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What InterTrust does is facilitate business models we find
very advantageous as a content company,'' said Larry Kenswil,
president of global commerce and advanced technology at Universal.
``What we've liked about them from the beginning is that they
thought long and hard about how people do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Johann Butting, chief executive of Bertelsman's unit for digital
rights management, praised InterTrust technology for working across
all the company's media products. ``We will go to great lengths to
have as few platforms as possible,'' he said, ``and will try to get
our clients to use InterTrust. For a big media company, it doesn't
make sense to go with systems that work with just one vertical
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann is also one of the world's leading publishers of
books and magazines, and its record label, BMG, is second only to
Universal in market share. The BMG division has not yet signed a
deal with InterTrust, but analysts and industry executives say a
deal may be imminent, given Intertrust's relationship with
Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the manufacturing side, InterTrust recently signed a deal
with Cirrus Logic to build security directly into chips for
portable music players, cell phones, hand-held devices and home
stereos.
</P>
<P>
   InterTrust's digital commerce system, known as the MetaTrust
Utility, packages content with rules governing its usage in
encrypted files known as DigiBoxes, which can be downloaded from
Web sites or passed among friends. To open a DigiBox file, a user
must install InterTrust's InterRights Point Software, to be
distributed by content companies.
</P>
<P>
   The user's credit card information is locked into the software,
and payments, specified by the usage rules of the DigiBox, are
automatically deducted.
</P>
<P>
   Managing payments and tracking usage falls to third-party
clearinghouse companies. NatWest, Mitsubishi and Reciprocal are
among the companies that have signed on as clearinghouses.
</P>
<P>
   One of InterTrust's major challenges will be to maintain the
security of its system. InterTrust executives acknowledge that like
any such system, their security is not perfect. But they expect it
to be robust enough to deter most attempts by hackers to break the
code.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, InterTrust earns revenue only from licensing fees.
But in the future, the company expects that its main revenue will
come from a fee ranging from 0.6 percent to 2 percent for each
transaction using InterTrust technology.
</P>
<P>
   InterTrust shares closed at $149.6875 on Friday, more than eight
times its initial offering price of $18 in October.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter that ended Sept. 30 the company had revenue of
just $363,000 and an operating loss of 25 cents a share. J.P.
Morgan, which lists the stock as a ``buy,'' expects Intertrust's
total revenue for 1999 to be $1.4 million and that it will become
profitable in late 2001.
</P>
<P>
   One potential hazard is growing concern about online abuses of
consumer privacy. InterTrust's technology enables publishers to
collect usage data on protected content. While InterTrust does not
collect this data directly, it does collect fees each time one of
its partners sells demographic information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to collect information for sale, our only
requirement is that they say what they're doing,'' David Van Wie,
InterTrust's chairman, said.

NEW PROJECTS SHOULD RISE AFTER 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ms) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With several weeks to go before Year 2000 computer problems are
most likely to be widely apparent, some pollsters and survey takers
are already beginning to ask, what next? Computer companies and the
consulting firms that advise them have been particularly interested
in asking their customers for information about how much Year 2000
has affected investment and when the floodgates will open for new
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such study, released late last week by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, reported that companies with more than $100
million annual sales would spend 20 percent of the information
technology budget this year on Year 2000 preparations, that budgets
would rise next year and that 40 percent of them would be working
on major software projects that had been deferred because of Year
2000 preparations.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear sign that such companies expect only minor Year 2000
disruptions, the survey found that 73 percent planned to begin
rolling out their deferred projects in the first three months of
next year. ``What we are seeing here is pent-up demand,'' said Lynn
Edelson, head of Pricewaterhouse's operational and systems risk
practice in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Rubin, a consultant and researcher in Pound Ridge,
N.Y., who has been following Year 2000 work at large companies
since the mid-1990s, said that Pricewaterhouse's data, gathered in
October, was probably already out of date. The percentage of large
companies spending 30 percent or more of their information
technology budget on Year 2000, for example, has fallen from 20
percent in September to about 14 percent in Rubin's latest research
as more companies finish their work under budget.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Rubin said, the companies, which generally have
revenues of $2 billion or more, spent just 8.4 percent of their
budgets on Year 2000 this year. Many of them made large investments
in e-commerce suggesting that whatever pent-up demand exists is
probably greater in middle and smaller-size companies that devoted
a higher percentage of their spending to Year 2000.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Web sites keep it simple; attract teen shoppers onlineBy Frances
Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teens shopping online are the same as the kids you see in the
mall. They love to shop, but they hate being treated like kids.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites marketing directly to kids are struggling to hit the
right note with young consumers and their parents. They're also
developing ways for kids to shop online without asking mom or dad
for a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study of 16-22-year-olds from Forrester Research,
47 percent or 12.4 million young adults are online and have an
average of $3,000-$5,000 to spend annually. Teens are extremely
loyal to their favorite brands, but that doesn't translate into
online visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers have this notion that young adults are very
different and go after the cool stuff,'' says Forrester analyst
Ekaterina Walsh. ``So they stack their sites with unnecessary
features like chat, games and music that kids don't expect from a
retailing site.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to Pepsi and Levis as two sites that have loaded up
with lots of ``hip'' Web gimmicks to lure young shoppers, but
instead are turning them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levis has its own music channel and a petition you can sign to
protest violence in schools,'' Walsh says. ``The one thing they had
that was useful, which they pulled out, was online purchasing. You
can do all kinds of things on the Levi's site but you can't shop.
Kids don't want to see music or games on a retailing site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are making their own decision and they have been for a
long time, especially urban kids,'' says Ginger Thomson, president
of DoughNet, an online service for kids 13-18 who don't have the
credit cards typically needed for Web shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can open a bank account for their kids with
www.DoughNet.com's virtual banking partner, US Access Bank in
Louisville, Ky. Purchases made from online retailers or donations
to non-profit organizations are deducted from the account.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says young adults don't completely live up to their
rebellious images. They may not want to go shopping with mom and
dad, but they still want parental approval before they head out on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those sites has a parent section,'' Walsh says.
``They want parents as allies. The pitch is what is the alternative
to not using DoughNet? Letting kids run loose in the mall with your
credit card? That's probably their worst nightmare. Sites like
these let parents determine where the kids can shop and what they
can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   It also keeps them away from pornography and extremely violent
books and videos. Another teen-oriented shopping site,
www.ICanBuy.com, has controls that allow parents to choose the
stores their children can shop at and approve each purchase before
the youngster completes the order.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson says DoughNet members use the site to shop and invest on
their own. It includes investment tools that help kids budget the
money in their account.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do want to be smarter about spending money, since they
don't have that much of it.'' (The average DoughNet member has $115
in his or her account.)
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says the best approach is not to treat teenagers like some
exotic species to be suckered into shopping, but to treat them like
adult shoppers. ``These kids are mature and pragmatic,'' she says.
``Especially the boys. They will pay extra to get something without
a hassle. They want quality for as little money as possible. They
are willing to hunt for brands and convenience. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The best model is Wal-Mart,'' Walsh says. ``It's on top of
teens' lists of brands they like and sites they visit. Yet Wal-Mart
is a clean site. You can just get in, shop and get out. All the
people trying to attract kids are doing exactly the wrong thing.
That's the irony. It's really just old wine in a new bottle.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Holiday shopping stampede causing Web site woes
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This online shopping thing just sounds so easy,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   You log on, go to a Web site, click on the stuff you want and
everything magically turns up at your home.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's only been a few weeks since the official start of the
holiday shopping season and many online shopping sites are starting
to look like the Grinch has already been there and stolen
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers looking for the hot Nintendo Pokemon trading cards or
video games didn't find much some days last week at eToys or KBkids
except ``sorry, out of stock'' messages and an offer of e-mail when
a new shipment comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers looking for chic pashmina shawls at the discount
clothing and accessory site BlueFly.com also were getting ``out of
stock'' messages during the days just after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to say how business is at online video/DVD seller
Reel.com _ shoppers trying to get into the site were greeted with
an error message saying ``server too busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst David Schatsky says that this is
the dark side of online retailing, particularly during the holiday
season. As more and more shoppers come online, Web retailers are
having trouble keeping up with increasing demand both for access to
the sites themselves and merchandise availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holiday season means a lot of people and a lot of
orders,'' he says. ``Last year, sites were crashing and response
time was slow. This year many sites have invested in hardware and
servers to address those problems, but we still anticipate problems
on the back end.''
</P>
<P>
   Schatsky says that only 10 percent of online retailers said they
could handle an overnight doubling of shopping volume _ and volume
at Christmastime can more than double.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson here,'' he says, ``is that Internet commerce is
much more than a Web site and a marketing plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter predicts that those who will have especially rough going
are sites launching for the first time this holiday season. ``It's
a risky proposition for brand-new sites to launch in a time of peak
volume,'' he says. ``It takes a long time to get a Web site
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Kapp, who heads up all the Internet ventures for the
Estee Lauder cosmetics company, which includes the Clinique, Bobbi
Brown and Origins Web sites, says that whenever she launches a
site, it's only about 70 percent the way she'd like it to be. ``It
usually takes time and user feedback to figure out what users
really want and how they interact with the site,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Seiff, president and CEO of Bluefly.com, says that the
nature of the site means that inventory is limited and he's likely
to run out of items. Still, shoppers visit the site in search of
other deals besides the shawls. Seiff says he never would have been
able to make it through the Thanksgiving holiday weekend without
massive upgrades to the site's software and increased staffing in
the customer service department.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder and Bluefly may have learned from experience, but
brand-new sites may not know what they're up against when it comes
to filling orders and helping out confused first-time shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's madness,'' Schatsky says of new sites planning to go live
for the first time in the holiday season. ``Wal-Mart decided to
delay redesigning and expanding its site until next year,
recognizing that the human factors and the logistics are not
something you want to dabble with during the crucial holiday
season.''
</P>
<P>
   So, while you will be able to log on to every shopping site your
heart desires, you may find the virtual equivalent of empty
shelves. Delayed delivery dates or other problems have less to do
with Internet technology than with the simple laws of supply and
demand.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to remember that, even though you are
shopping at home, perhaps in your pajamas at 2 a.m., online
retailing isn't much different from plain old-fashioned catalog
shopping. Your order has been taken, but now the people at the Web
site have to find the product, package it, gift-wrap it, if
necessary, and get it to you.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Amazon.com have spent the past year setting up
distribution centers all over the county, including one in Georgia,
to cut down on shipping costs and speed delivery to users. Other
companies chose to base their warehouses in Chicago or other
Midwestern airport hubs so delivery can be held down to three days.
</P>
<P>
   As you shop, beware that things can still go wrong, even if the
perfect gifts for your loved ones are in stock. Some sites may have
people keying in orders or packaging items. Errors can and will
occur.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Web site is running smoothly, there could be
problems down the line. Sites such as Barnes &AMP; Noble and
1-800-Flowers.com have been beefing up technical and customer
support to make sure problems are solved, orders are delivered and
there are plenty of goods in stock.
</P>
<P>
   If something should go wrong, remember, the problem might not be
the retailer, it might be your PC. If your computer crashes as you
are about to finalize a transaction, you may have to call or e-mail
to find out if the order was processed. Rowan Trollope, director of
development and an e-commerce specialist with Symantec, makers of
Norton computer protection software, suggests keeping your computer
in top shape to prevent crashes or other electronic mishaps. ``The
bottom line is the computer is being used for something that is
important to the user, so it had better be running,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holiday shopping will not be problem-free,'' Schatsky says,
``but it does beat the mall.''

 Schwab Changes Strategy, Will Charge for Advice 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  With competition among online
<TEXT>
brokers reaching unprecedented heights, Charles Schwab Corp. plans
to increase the custom-tailored advice it offers retail investors,
taking it further than ever from its discount broker roots.
<P>
   And, in a radical departure for the San Francisco firm, it will
start charging a fee for some forms of investment advice, marking
the first time in its nearly three-decade history that Schwab has
asked customers to pay to speak with its representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab will roll out two fee-based advice programs. The first is
described as a portfolio checkup, in which a representative will
evaluate whether a customer's assets, including those held at other
firms, are in appropriate investments for their age group, economic
circumstances and financial goals.
</P>
<P>
   The second program will be preparation of a financial plan using
a prepackaged product provided by a third-party vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been selectively testing the services for several
months and will begin offering them in all its 320 branches
nationwide sometime next year. It says it is still deciding how
much to charge and stresses that its representatives will continue
to offer less-detailed investment help for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at how to provide personalized service and
advice without grossly inflating our expense structure,'' said
Susanne Lyons, Schwab's chief of retail client services. ``We think
personalized advice is worth paying for.``
</P>
<P>
   The moves comes as traditional brokers, most notably Wall Street
behemoth Merrill Lynch, invade the low-priced Internet investing
space that Schwab dominates. Merrill this year has unveiled two
online brokerage options, including a $29.95-per-trade Internet
account targeted directly at Schwab's slice of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional firms specialize in offering clients specific
investment recommendations, including suggestions on which mutual
funds, stocks and bonds to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Schwab has stepped up the degree of customer
hand-holding it offers. Company representatives now will suggest
what kinds of assets clients should put their money into and refer
them to investment-selection tools, but stop short of specific
stock recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Given the new competition from traditional brokers, not to
mention the ever-broadening array of services offered by online
rivals such as E-Trade Group, analysts say Schwab has to give
investors more investment ideas to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts say, customers might resist paying for something
they think they should get for free. Schwab must make it clear that
it is charging for new advice programs, not simply slapping fees on
services it used to do for free, analysts note.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can add value and service, customers may accept it,''
said Amar Mehta, an analyst with the brokerage CIBC World Markets.
``And, if you look at what Merrill charges for advice, it's still
likely to be higher that what Schwab charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's services aren't strictly comparable, but its basic
account offering investment advice charges an annual fee of 1
percent of assets with no commissions on stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab could also face objections from some of the 5,600
independent investment advisers it works with, who manage about 30
percent of the firm's customer assets.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has built relationships with outside advisers advisors to
manage the accounts of customers who aren't comfortable handling
their own investments. Some of those advisers may view Schwab's new
programs as substitutes for their own services. Schwab says its
programs are aimed at a different group of customers than those who
go to independent advisers.

`SOUTH PARK' CREATORS PLAN CARTOON SERIES FOR THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (jt) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest examples of how Hollywood is trying
to turn the Internet into an entertainment venue, the creators of
the television show ``South Park'' said they had agreed to make a
series of 39 short cartoons for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoons, which will be different from South Park, will be
distributed starting next March on Shockwave.com, an entertainment
Web site run by Macromedia Inc., a software company. Trey Parker
and Matt Stone, the creators of ``South Park,'' will receive equity
of less than 10 percent in Shockwave.com, which is being run as a
separate subsidiary of Macromedia and is expected to eventually
issue its own shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the entertainment and computer industries, from
Steven Spielberg to unknown animators and directors, are
distributing or planning to distribute cartoons, television
programs and movies through the Internet. Still, it is unclear how
successful this will be as a business.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he and his partner were attracted to the Web by the
freedom it offered to go beyond the language and content
restrictions of television. ``We're definitely excited to push
those limits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Parker had turned down offers to do Web programs
in the past because the Internet technology was so crude. ``It's
really just now the technology made it possible to do cool stuff on
the Web, especially in animation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the Web-based entertainment is derived from
television, movies or comic books, Parker and Stone will create new
characters and a new series that will be seen first on the
Internet. If a creation succeeds on the Web, it might then be sold
or distributed to TV networks or movie studios, having already
built up an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can deliver from the get-go are millions of viewers,''
said Mike Simpson, executive vice president of the William Morris
Agency, which represented Stone and Parker. This could become a
much less expensive and risky way to develop new shows than making
full-length pilots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone will retain the copyrights to their work,
although Shockwave.com will share in revenues even from television
programs or movies based on the Internet characters, according to
Rob Burgess, chairman and chief executive of Macromedia, which is
based in San Francisco. ``We think it's a watershed deal with
Hollywood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The animations will be two to five minutes long and will be
viewable using Macromedia's Flash software, which the company says
is already on 200 million computers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the barriers to entertainment on the Web is the poor
video image quality and long transmission times. But that is not as
big a problem for animation because software like Flash allows
cartoons with near television quality to be transmitted reasonably
fast. Image quality is even less of a factor for the crude type of
animation in ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Shockwave.com last week received investments totaling $44
million from Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm that backed
such companies as Cisco Systems and Yahoo, and from Jim Clark, the
entrepreneur who started Silicon Graphics and Netscape
Communications.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    The wish list: Online shoppers hottest navigation tool for the
holidays
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wish lists and gift registries could be the hottest thing online
next to Pokemon trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll from Harris Interactive and www.amazon.com,
people shop online to avoid the crowds, the lines and the hassles
of shopping at the mall. They want to be able to shop quickly and
easily, anytime day or night, so they can spend more time with
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that did come through in the survey,'' says
Amazon.com's marketing vice president Jaleh Bisharat, ``is that
finding the right gift is the most stressful part of online
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   So Amazon and other online merchants have devised ``wish lists''
to help frazzled shoppers find the right gift.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's gift registry lets users roam every area of its site
choosing things they'd like to receive as gifts. Instead of putting
items into a shopping cart and making a purchase, they place items
on a wish list that they can annotate with comments such as ``This
is the gift I really want.'' The users also select people to be
notified by e-mail how to link to their list.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can use Amazon's gift registry, but it's most popular
with teenagers _ a group often cited by adults as the toughest to
shop for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish lists are a great idea,'' says Forrester Research analyst
Ekaterina Walsh. ``It makes sense for parents because they don't
have to figure out what their kids want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about using technology to solve real-world problems,''
says Bob Sacco, marketing vice president of SecretWish.com, a Web
site gift registry for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that are cool among teens that change
daily and parents are constantly perplexed as to what to buy
them,'' says Sacco. ``A gift registry aimed at teens helps the gift
buying process.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens who visit Secret Wish register and shop from a selected
list of online vendors. ``We've created a mall for teens so the
user experience is very easy,'' says Secret Wish president and CEO
Joachim Kim. ``We tried to present products that appeal, products
that speak specifically to teens.
</P>
<P>
   With teenagers, ``the shopping and buying actions are often
separate,'' says Melanie Alshab, president of FastFrog.com, an
Internet company that sets up shop in locals malls. Kids get
scanners to pick out items in participating stores and upload their
choices to the Web for parents and relatives to look over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laziness is the mother of invention,'' says Secret Wish's Kim.
``Buyers ask kids to send a wish list because they are going
shopping that weekend,'' he says. ``I've been begging my nephew to
give me a wish list so I'll know what to get him. Wish lists are
like a virtual Santa's lap for kids who are too big to sit on
Santa's lap anymore.''

funds for the general election campaign and abide by federal

Rove also said that Bush is being told by officials of Dell and

ROBBINS DELIVERS AN EMPTY `CRADLE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Robbins' unbearably earnest new movie, ``Cradle Will Rock,''
is full of good intentions and bad filmmaking. In attempting to
tell the true story of Orson Welles' 1937 production of a leftish
musical, Robbins gets the facts right, but fails to deliver them in
a manner that will make anyone care. Flat and clunky, the film ends
up being as oppressive as the capitalist barons it seeks to
demonize.
</P>
<P>
   The actual story itself is a fascinating piece of theater
history and pre-McCarthy hysteria. The government-funded Federal
Theater Project was an outgrowth of FDR's efforts to put people
back to work even if the unemployed were only actors. Among the
shows the Project produced was a pro-labor musical called ``Cradle
Will Rock.'' Orson Welles, then 22, rehearsed the show, but never
had the chance to actually stage it because the government shut
down the theater and barred the actors from appearing.
</P>
<P>
   But you know show-business folk. The show must go on.
Unfortunately, ``Cradle Will Rock'' itself goes on and on and on,
with far too many sketchily drawn characters and one subplot that
has no business being in the movie. Robbins roughly moves from the
theater world to the lobby of Rockefeller Center, where Nelson
Rockefeller (John Cusack, thoroughly unconvincing) has commissioned
Mexican artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural. Rivera
complies, but irks Rockefeller by going crazy with pro-communism
depictions.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins tries to tie all this together (along with a
head-scratching riff on the death of vaudeville) into a meditation
on corporate and government censorship. That's a tall order to pull
off, and Robbins, who also wrote the movie, simply hasn't come up
with a coherent enough style or story to make it work. The movie
shifts abruptly in tone, maudlin at one moment, boisterous the
next. It only becomes involving toward the end when ``Cradle's''
actors threaten to defy government orders and present their show.
But by then, you've already mentally given the proceedings the
proverbial hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradle'' is full of fine actors, but many of them (like
Cusack) simply aren't right for their roles. Among the misbegotten:
Susan Sarandon as an Italian propagandist selling Da Vincis to pay
for Mussolini's saber rattling; Bill Murray as an alcoholic
ventriloquist; and Angus Macfadyen, who turns Welles into a cartoon
hambone. Emily Watson, Joan Cusack and Hank Azaria manage a few
fine moments between them, but their hands are mostly tied by the
windy script.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins has made two fine movies (``Dead Man Walking'' and ``Bob
Roberts''), but those films didn't have the scope or ambition of
this film. Here, his lofty ambitions have stretched him thin,
producing a ``Cradle'' that will most likely rock you to sleep. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Clark, the co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp., and
media baron Rupert Murdoch have formed an alliance in an attempt to
seize a chunk of the growing Internet health information craze.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's New York-based News Corp. and Clark's Atlanta-based
Healtheon/WebMD Corp. on Tuesday announced a partnership in which
Healtheon will exchange its medical programming for a half-interest
in News Corp.'s The Health
</P>
<P>
   Network cable TV station.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also calls for Healtheon to assume a 100 percent share
of News Corp.'s thehealthnetwork.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The financial terms of the partnership include $700 million in
branding services provided by News Corp. over 10 years and a $100
million purchase of Healtheon/WebMD stock at $50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the alliance includes a $100 million cash
investment by News Corp. in an international joint venture and a
$62.5 million five-year licensing agreement for syndication of
WebMD daily broadcast content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we announced an ideal partnership to help us achieve our
goal of establishing a multimedia, multirevenue-generating business
in the trillion-dollar health care industry,'' Murdoch, chairman
and chief executive of the News Corp., said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clark founded Healtheon 1996 after he was dismayed by the
complicated forms he had to fill out during a hospital visit.
</P>
<P>
   The company links physicians, insurers, labs and pharmacies over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, launched in October 1998, offers Internet information
services to doctors. The two companies merged in May.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. is Murdoch's sprawling entertainment, news, newspaper
and Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal broadens Healtheon's potential while helping News Corp.
expand its reach into the Internet and an important growth
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is clearly one of the biggest areas of our lives and
economy,'' said Stephen Fitzgibbons, a senior research analyst
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``News Corp., which is trying
to be a broad media player, especially on the Internet, is smart to
move into this area.''

HEROES VS. THE `RED DEVIL' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Dan Marciniac was in Fire Station 2 on State
Street, doing paper work, when the call came in around 9:30 Sunday
night. It was a 99.
</P>
<P>
   Schenectady firefighters see maybe half a hundred 99s a year.
When a 99 comes in, it means the fire is big and mean and fully
capable of killing you when you do battle with it.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened to 11 Schenectady firefighters in this
century. Most went down from what the professionals refer to as
fire heart attacks. You're fighting this thing ... the Red Devil,
they call it ... and all your body's systems are operating at
full-tilt boogie.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes your heart can't take it. You don't know that until it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fire heart attack that killed Donny Collins three years
ago. Marciniac still misses him. These professional firefighters
are tight. They live together in the station. Many of them are
related. As with police work, fighting fires is often a family
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Marciniac's father was a fire lieutenant, just as Dan is, and he
retired on disability after a fire heart attack. A 22-year veteran,
Dan Marciniac is 47, which is heart attack territory even if you
don't fight fires for a living.
</P>
<P>
   As his rig rolled to the blaze on Chestnut Street, Marciniac
wasn't thinking about that. He also wasn't thinking consciously
about the six firefighters who had died just two days earlier in a
blazing warehouse in Worcester, Mass., only a 150 miles east. After
all, there are so many ways to die when you fight fires, why sweat
it when you have business to attend to?
</P>
<P>
   This fire was in an old house that had been chopped into four
apartments. Schenectady is crammed with these tinderboxes. They're
aged structures of dry wood, erected before flame-resistant
materials were available. They go up like paper.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Farry, a guy of 40 who is in his 12th year as a Schenectady
firefighter, had responded from anoterh station. He was on the back
stairs, wrestling with a hose, when something came down on him.
He's still not sure what it was. All he knows is that it knocked
him off his feet, and he went down the stairs face-first, slamming
his head into something.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I know,'' he said, ``I was lying out in the
yard and people were standing over me yelling at me to move and not
to move and all kinds of stuff. They said I went as limp as a
noodle when I hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Marciniac was coming up the stairs when Farry went down.
Marciniac went on to the attic, where guys already on the scene
were running out of air. The air tanks are supposed to be good for
a half-hour, but you suck up a ton of oxygen when the Red Devil is
raging around you. You're lucky if you get 15 minutes before your
warning bell goes off.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, amid the smoke and the flames, Marciniac's bell
sounded. He bent down to take off his mask. That's when some chunk
of fire debris came down on him and
</P>
<P>
   slammed him to the floor. Three other guys were there. One took
off his breathing gear and put it on Marciniac. They loaded him
onto an orange plastic stretcher. Six guys carried him down the
stairs and got him the hell out.
</P>
<P>
   Marciniac came out of Sunday's fire OK. Farry has a concussion,
but he knows he's lucky he didn't snap his neck when he hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Devil wasn't so lucky. He was beaten to death by a group
of gallant, gutsy guys who wouldn't dream of making a living any
other way.
</P>

TAKING CHANCES WITH `MISS JULIE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being cast as an oversize hor &UR; s &LR;  d'oeuvre opposite a
mutant shark in her previous big-screen adventure, Saffron Burrows
was understandably eager to fasten onto a fleshier role.
</P>
<P>
   So when veteran director Mike Figgis chose Burrows to star in
his film adaptation of August Strindberg's erotically frenzied play
``Miss Julie,'' he was confident he'd found the ideal man-eating
19th-century femme fatale.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis already had seen Burrows in ``Deep Blue Sea'' and he'd
worked with her twice before, on his feature films ``One Night
Stand'' and the risky but critically well-received ``The Loss of
Sexual Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   The director also felt sure that, having proven his industry
mettle with commercial hits such as ``Leaving Las Vegas'' and
``Internal Affairs,'' he'd be able to shelter the young British
actress from the Hollywood piranha pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt I would be strong enough to protect her and to help
her,'' the director says. ``In other words, she'd get the
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she didn't, Burrows, 26, knew she could complain directly
to the worldly, older man who sleeps beside her whenever they
happen to be in the same city.
</P>
<P>
   His name? Mike Figgis.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, of course, it's accepted standard practice for
off-screen romantic partners to collaborate on-camera as well.
</P>
<P>
   What's unusual about ``Miss Julie,'' which opens Friday at area
theaters, is the nerve-racking degree of claustrophobic intimacy
and psychological brutality that suffuses Strindberg's 1888 play -
not something most couples other than Liz Taylor and the late
Richard Burton probably would want to import into their own
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the knowledge that certain industry predators
would be licking their lips in anticipation of the biggest
potential for a his-and-hers box-office contretemps since Blake
Edwards bombed with Julie Andrews in ``Darling Lili.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which, initially, made for a situation that Figgis, 51,
understatedly describes as ``really tricky. !ital!Really!off!
tricky.``
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's one of the best parts ever written for a
woman,'' Figgis says. ``You know that if you put your partner in a
film, if you fail you will be so castigated and so ridiculed for
doing it, and she will be made to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as ``Miss Julie'' has begun gathering positive
word-of-mouth from its initial press screenings, the film makers
are aware not everyone in Hollywood will be lining up to bless the
happy couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people who won't like it because they
disagree with our interpretation, or because they know about Mike's
and my relationship,'' says Burrows, an assured, witty and calmly
articulate young woman. ``I'm prepared for that.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, controversy is nothing new to ``Miss Julie.'' Once
banned in Strindberg's Swedish homeland for its fiery themes of
sexual and class transgression, this tragic three-character soap
opera retains its power to stir a modern audience.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally and in other ways, the play bears a strong
resemblance to Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
</P>
<P>
   The action takes place in the kitchen of a wealthy count's
isolated country estate. Miss Julie, the count's beautiful,
headstrong daughter, has decided to seduce Jean, the count's
ambitious foot-servant.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a single evening, their flirtation turns
increasingly dangerous and desperate, as the emotionally unstable
Miss Julie seeks to escape from the stifling confines of her
assigned class and gender, while Jean schemes to use his social
superior as a ticket to the middle-class respectability he
ruthlessly craves.
</P>
<P>
   The third leg of this isosceles love-hate triangle is Christine,
the count's cook and Jean's clandestine mistress, played in the
film by Maria Doyle Kennedy (``Moll Flanders,'' ``The General.'').
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time the play's focus, like the film's, stays
relentlessly locked on its two antagonists, as they circle each
other in a seductive, suicidal pas de deux that ends in the
physical death of one of them and the spiritual destruction of the
other. Shot in long takes on Super 16mm with two roaming hand-held
cameras, the film never strays more than a few feet from the
kitchen, so that the audience comes to share the characters'
feelings of entrapment.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what made the play radical (and ultimately popular) in
its own time was its blunt depiction of how sex and class can
intersect to produce a complicated power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the last generation to really see the
connection (between sex and power) was the Elizabethans,'' says
Peter Mullan, the Scotland-born actor-director who plays Jean.
``Because (to the Elizabethans) it was so out there, so obvious.
You know, shag an aristocrat and you can eat for a year! These
days, obviously, are a damn sight more complex. We've reduced it
now to Monica (Lewinsky) stories and cigar jokes, when in actual
fact it's much, much more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that ``Miss Julie'' still reverberates in the 1990s,
Figgis had been wanting to make the film for at least eight years.
Although other film makers were known to be considering big-screen
versions, Figgis reasoned that ``the text was 100 years old
already, so it wasn't like a hot script that if I didn't do it next
week it would get gobbled up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what attracted him to such a biting and difficult play,
generally less well-known than such comparable contemporary works
as Henrik Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler,'' Figgis replies unhesitatingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (`Miss Julie') is tough. I mean, it's very
uncompromising,'' he says. ``I mean, I went to see `American
Beauty' yesterday, and that's a film that's coming out as a kind of
tough, sort of uncompromising look at relationships. And yet I
found it to be really soft, in fact, very compromising. And `Miss
Julie' doesn't do that. It actually gets tougher by increments. And
it doesn't let the audience off the hook. It's a really adult
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Figgis had two very different actors in mind for
Miss Julie and Jean: Juliette Binoche, a best supporting actress
Oscar winner for ``The English Patient,'' and Nicolas Cage, a best
actor Oscar winner for Figgis' ``Leaving Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   But when both became tied up with other projects, Figgis decided
on an open casting call. He suggested that Burrows a relative
unknown who at the time was shooting Renny Harlin's sci-fi thriller
about genetically altered sharks, ``Deep Blue Sea'' read for the
part of Miss Julie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair not to include you just because of our
relationship,'' he told Burrows. ``That's as unfair as putting you
in the film (a priori).
</P>
<P>
   ``So I made her single read-through the entire script. And then
I said, `That wasn't bad.' And actually it was very good. But you
know, it's not an easy script, and the psychology is never what it
seems to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two more private read-throughs followed, with Figgis passing
along ideas and suggestions in the form of notes. By the third
reading, Figgis felt he'd found his leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point you've got to kind of go with your hunch,''
he says. ``And I kind of thought, well, I know that she's a very
intelligent actress and that she listens carefully. And what then
becomes vitally important is who's playing Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   Figgis says he decided to approach Mullan after ``about 10
minutes'' of watching his portrayal of a recovering alcoholic in
Ken Loach's ``My Name Is Joe,'' for which Mullan won the 1998 best
actor award at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, Figgis took the train up from London to
Glasgow, Scotland, where Mullan lives. They chatted about the
project in a local pub, after which Figgis offered the actor the
job. Mullan said OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was as casual as that,'' Figgis says.
</P>
<P>
   For the director, the chief remaining question was how his stars
would get along on a project that required them to be on-screen
together for one intense, 15-minute take after another.
</P>
<P>
   Mullan, born to a poor working-class Glasgow family, had gotten
his start as an actor performing agitprop theater and heavily
politicized community drama at prisons and unemployed-workers'
centers. He also was one of the founders of Scotland's recently
formed Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put the two of them together, that was a very, I think,
worrying moment for everybody,'' Figgis says. ``I think Saffron was
terrified of meeting Peter because he's older and a very respected
actor and clearly a very experienced actor and very hardcore
left-wing. You know, not one with any sympathy for lovies. I was
aware of the fact that he probably didn't know Saffron's work and
I'd told him what our relationship was. There was no point in not
being open about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as it turned out, there wasn't. Not only did the actors
instantly hit it off, they discovered they shared a similar
worldview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very similar politically,'' says Burrows, who hails
from a long line of social activists. ``I often get quite
frustrated with a sort of apathetic liberalism that seems to exist
amongst actors, a kind of sitting on the fence, or there's often a
general look on life that is a little too wishy-washy for me. And
Peter is incredibly passionate about class politics and about the
state of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   While a mutual appreciation of Marxist social theory isn't
normally required in Hollywood, mutual trust between actors usually
helps. Their off-screen rapport allowed Burrows and Mullan to
establish a supportive on-screen chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `How could Jean be so mean and all this stuff?'''
Mullan remarks. ``And it's like, well, I really like Saffron, and
Saffron really liked me, and trusted me, and I trust her. That's
how. Because then I can play the game to the full, I can get
horribler and horribler and we'd laugh about it. Like, `Wow, you
were really horrible on that one!'''
</P>
<P>
   With the project passing into the rear-view mirror, Burrows says
she's been gratified by the feedback she's already received from
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when I look back on this, I know this is going to be
one of the things I'm most proud of,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner sounds equally proud - but his memory may be longer.
He mentions one famous Hollywood actor who withdrew from the
project, and some Industry investors who turned ``very negative,''
after Burrows was cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really upset me,'' Figgis says, ``in the sense that they
can think what they like, but if they don't have enough respect for
me to actually realize that I would never in a million years
particularly if I had a great deal of affection for somebody would
ever put them in the situation of basically killing their career.
And so that I found very interesting. And I can't wait for those
people to see the film, and to meet them again.'' &QL;

ORAL HISTORY PROJECT FOCUSES ON HISPANIC VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID UHLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin
are in a race against time. In an oral history project called
``U.S. Latinos &AMP; World War II: Changes Seen, Changes Wrought,''
professors, interviewers and a documentary filmmaker plan to
collect the stories of Mexican-American veterans of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics who served in uniform and as civilians at military
installations are being sought for the project. The youngest among
them, however, are in their early 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 12 million living World War II
veterans of all ethnic backgrounds. Five thousand of them die every
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, these people are going to be with us for a few
years so that we can hear them,'' said Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez, a
journalism professor and leader of the project. ``There are some
amazing stories about the obstacles these people were able to
overcome during the war, on the home front and the battlefield.
They made tremendous contributions. Those contributions just have
not been given their due.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems, according to Rivas-Rodriguez, has been the
limited number of journalists, scholars and authors able and
willing to document the achievements of Hispanics from an older
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1940s were ``a time when Latinos were not considered a big
part of society,'' Rivas-Rodriguez said. ``Hispanics have
historically been treated as outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas project's look at the war and its
aftermath, as seen through the eyes of Hispanic men and women, has
several components. In addition to an oral history archive,
researchers plan to create a photography collection and publish a
book with pictures and interview excerpts. Also on the agenda: a
film by Hector Galan, an internationally acclaimed documentary
producer.
</P>
<P>
   An academic conference at the university in May 2000 is expected
to attract papers, scholars and additional financial support for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas-Rodriguez's work on ``U.S. Latinos &AMP; World War II'' has
already yielded some surprising finds for her _ within her own
family. Besides learning details about her mother's wartime work at
Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Rivas-Rodriguez also
discovered her father, an Army veteran, had seen combat in the
Aleutian Islands during a rare Japanese attack on North American
soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've heard a lot of people say is, `It's time for
our young people _ all young people, not just Latino young people _
to realize that there are some living heroes out there,''
Rivas-Rodriguez said. ``We don't have to watch these fictional
heroes on `Star Wars' for our little boys and girls to be thinking,
`I want to grow up like that.'''
</P>
<P>

DOUGLAS ENJOYS SPIRITUAL AND CAREER REBIRTHS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirk Douglas has been brushing up on his Hebrew and rehearsing a
speech that proclaims his entrance into manhood. Yes, Douglas was
set to celebrate his bar mitzvah Thursday, 70 years after his first
rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   For the screen veteran, the ceremony, held on his 83rd birthday,
is more than a solemn reflection on a good life blessed by family,
friends and professional success. It is symbolic of rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is making his film comeback this week as the star of
``Diamonds,'' about a former boxer, Harry Agensky, who hits the
road with his son (Dan Aykroyd) and grandson (Corbin Allred) in
search of some diamonds a Reno mobster stashed for him decades
earlier as a payoff for throwing a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Judaism, when you're 13 years old, you have a confirmation
called bar mitzvah. Then you say, `Boy, I've had it,' and you
forget being a Jew,'' he said. ``This birthday I'll be 83 years
old, and 70 years after my first bar mitzvah I will have my second
bar mitzvah. That means that I will assume that I am now 13 years
old again, and I will embark on a new career.''
</P>
<P>
   Only he's not 13. He is an octogenarian dealing with the
aftermath of a stroke nearly four years ago that left his speech
slurred. The stroke hit him about five years after he was seriously
injured in a helicopter crash.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Douglas looks his age. But then you can't help
but notice the straight posture, the firmness of the handshake, the
smacking sound a fist makes in the other palm when he emphasizes a
point. Watch closer to see the gleam in his eyes as he recalls
first spotting Lauren Bacall (who plays a bordello madam in
``Diamonds'') when she was just 16 and he 22.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas doesn't dwell on the past, instead he focuses on
what's to come. If you want to be on his good side, don't call him
a ``movie legend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complimented (by that term), because I think a legend
involves the past, and I'd like to think that, with my stroke, I'm
now embarking on a new career.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay had been written for an Alzheimer's patient when
producer Patricia Green of Total Film Group first brought it to
Douglas nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the script and thought, `Gee, I could do this
movie.' I know about Alzheimer's because my wife and I have given
the Alzheimer unit (to the Motion Picture and Television Fund's
retirement home in Woodland Hills),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wait, this guy should have a stroke, because, by
coincidence, I have had a stroke,' so we shaped it, and I was able
to inject lots of my own personal feelings, which gave it
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make a documentary. I wanted to make a movie
that could make you laugh, make you cry, move you in some way _
that's what a movie is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his contributions to the film are a lot of Harry Agensky's
dialogue when he talks about the trials of stroke recovery, the
idea that his mind moves at a brisk pace that his speech cannot
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrible thing about a stroke is the depression,'' he
said. ``That last of the screenplay I wrote myself. What I told
Bacall on the bed is true of how I felt. You want to cry and get
out of everything, but then you have to motivate yourself or, in my
case, my wife said, `Get your ass out of bed.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is humor, to be able to laugh at
yourself, to be able to have other people laugh at you,'' he said.
``I have often told people that before my stroke I was going to do
a picture with my son Michael. Then I had my stroke, and Michael
said, `Don't worry, Dad, you just work with a speech therapist,
then we'll do the movie.' I was mad and I said, `Michael, why don't
you work with my speech therapist, and when you talk like I talk,
we'll do the movie.' He thought that was very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder and younger Douglases have yet to co-star together on
the screen _ still looking for the right project, Kirk says _ but
last month they filmed a promotional TV spot for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, with 82 films under his belt, has seen a lot of changes
in how Hollywood works, but he seems to have maintained the same
standards he adopted when he made his film debut in 1946 with ``The
Strange Love of Martha Ivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Green said Douglas chose not to hire the stable of
assistants who aid most film stars these days, instead bringing his
wife, Anne, to Reno for just the first few days of the shoot. The
producer said despite his years, Douglas worked hard without
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Aykroyd said Douglas even did his own stunt work in an alley
scene when the three take on a mugger played by screenwriter Allan
Aaron Katz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was swinging. There was no stand-in. That was Kirk,''
Aykroyd said. ``He laced into the guy. I did a double take. He can
still move.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said, ``He was there every day until the work was done. He
never left early because he was tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude enriched the movie and our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Director John Asher, just 27 when the movie was made last year,
recalled how, on the first day of shooting, Douglas boosted the
filmmaker's self-esteem by listening to a direction, then simply
replying, ``Yes, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs went numb, and I about passed out,'' Asher said,
noting the gesture seemed to encourage others to look up to this
greenhorn young enough to be the star's grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas has a different view of the conversation's meaning.
``Look how pathetic that is, that a response like `yes, sir' _ the
right thing to say _ means so much to him. He was the director.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, at 83, is busier than many middle-age Hollywood stars.
He has tentative plans to appear in a screen remake of Tennessee
Williams' ``The Night of the Iguana,'' another potential film job
in the works, and a possible guest role on the TV series ``Touched
by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   He has written two autobiographies, three novels and two
children's books, the latest being the newly published ``Young
Heroes of the Bible,'' aimed at making Old Testament figures such
as Moses and Abraham more approachable for kids. He plans to write
another children's book.
</P>
<P>
   And, although his words are slow and deliberate, he often gives
speeches about stroke survival, or his charitable foundation's
projects, such as improving hundreds of run-down playgrounds at Los
Angeles schools.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Diamonds,'' Harry Agensky looks at photos of the strapping
young man in the boxing ring (actually stills from Douglas' 1949
film ``Champion'') and says mournfully, ``I miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas says he does not feel sad that he is no longer the
muscle-bound young man of ``Spartacus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think life goes on. I don't look back too much. I forced
myself to look back when I wrote `The Ragman's Son' to take
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I'm a young actor just starting out in my new
career _ with a British accent.''

SAN FRANCISCO: THE PLACE TO AVOID ON NEW YEAR'S EVE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eat first, dress warmly in layers, wear good
walking shoes and carry water.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the official recommendations for people planning to
celebrate the arrival of the new millennium in three weeks. They're
also what everyone does in San Francisco on any occasion. Good
walking shoes are an integral part of the mayor's transportation
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a more useful recommendation for millennium weekend: Put
in a three-day supply of champagne and beluga, or chips and brew,
and stay home.
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to be out on the streets of San Francisco that
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The first page alone of the Department of Public Health
millennium response plan is enough to give you a hangover. It
contains the Police Department estimate that San Francisco may have
to accommodate 750,000 visitors. ``Other planners believe the
</P>
<P>
   crowds could swell to 2 to 3 million and that the celebrations
could continue through Monday, Jan. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes this unnerving bit of information: The disaster
operation planned for that weekend has been given the code name
``Mellow Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't even use the word ``mellow'' in Marin anymore. It's a
sure sign of something bad about to happen, like a king telling his
peasants that they're entering the Dark Ages because darkness is so
restful.
</P>
<P>
   Does this passage from the health department's Y2K preparedness
report make you feel mellow? ``Projections for ill and injured
persons at planned and spontaneous events are in the range of 1,892
to 5,676 casualties from the 1.25 million celebrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Give or take a headache. Where do they get such exact casualty
estimates? I sure hope they're counting headaches, because the
attack on Pearl Harbor caused 3,457 casualties, and nobody called
that ``mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've already booked a hotel room in San Francisco, get in
it and stay in it.
</P>
<P>
   Some other highlights from the millennium disaster plan:
</P>
<P>
   _ The plan has detailed estimates of crowds and casualty
estimates for each ``planned venue'' for millennium parties. Union
Square is expected to attract 22,000 people for the ``Gathering of
the Tribes Ecumenical Celebration,'' a Neiman Marcus dinner party
and fireworks. Casualties are estimated at 63.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what kind of tribes they're talking about or if the
folks at Neiman's will have to circle their limousines. That seems
like a high casualty rate for a religious event, or even a dinner
party.
</P>
<P>
   _ A category called ``hotels, clubs, miscellaneous'' is expected
to draw 660,000 people and result in 1,888 casualties. What can you
say? It's that miscellaneous that always gets you.
</P>
<P>
   _ Besides ``planned venues,'' the health department lists
projected crowds and casualties at ``spontaneous venues,'' which
sounds ominous. It basically means strangers showing up and
drinking and puking in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of casualties are they talking about? The eight
``millennium field care clinics'' (why not ``millennium MASH
units?'') are set up to treat everything from lacerations with
controlled bleeding and musculoskeletal injuries down to the
all-important ``referrals to detoxification centers.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be several official holding areas for inebriated
adults and youth _ guarded ones, not just the sidewalks and bars of
Sixth Street and North Beach.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a thorough triage system, with serious injuries
such as gunshot wounds going to San Francisco General Hospital's
trauma center, with perhaps one other hospital as back-up because
of increased volume or traffic gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists will be on full alert and all existing restraint
and seclusion rooms at San Francisco General will be ready for the
wilder of the wild and crazy. The Irwin Memorial Blood Bank is
delivering blood in advance for those who leave their heart's vital
fluids in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, the Birth Center at San Francisco General will be
staffed at full capacity and the Neonatal/Nursery Unit will be
prepared for ``concomitant increased volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of San Francisco General Hospital as the finish line for
all those folks who nine months ago decided they wanted the first
baby of the new millennium. And if you live further east, don't
even think of chasing midnight west to San Francisco to get that
winning birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Don't come here. Stay home. You won't miss a thing but the
chance to make a casualty estimate come true.
</P>

CHIEFTANS' MOLONEY IN TUNE WITH CHRISTMAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paddy Moloney of Ireland's the Chieftains has come out with a
new holiday CD that's neither very Irish nor even totally
Christmasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silent Night: Christmas in Rome'' might as easily be titled
``Christmas Around the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it has a smattering of the Chieftains but also the
sounds of an Italian choir and orchestra on ``The Neopolitan
Bagpipers Carol (On That Most Blessed Night)''; the tight, nasal
harmony of the Bulgarian Voices Angelite; and a crystal clear
Norwegian rendition of ``Silent Night'' by Sissel, best-known for
her contributions to the ``Titanic'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a high-spirited version of ``Joy to the World''
arranged by Moloney for the Harlem Gospel Choir. In between are
lesser-known Irish and Norwegian tunes as well as original melodies
by Moloney and Marco Frisina, conductor of the Choir of the
Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano and the Orchestra Sinfonica
della Diocesi di Roma. (Frisina also has composed for Hollywood,
winning a CableACE award for the score to ``Joseph'' in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   Moloney hadn't put out a holiday recording since the Chieftains'
``Bells of Dublin'' in 1991. He said he wanted to do an album whose
tracks told the Christmas story and thought the most fitting place
to do it was Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, I met with Marco Frisina, the Monsignor _ I
call him the pope's composer,'' Moloney said. ``I'd thought about
doing a Christmas album of different kinds, and we had a chat about
it and said, `You do this, and I'll do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the project mushroomed as more diverse performers
signed on. ``I'm just never satisfied,'' Moloney said. ``I just
want to bring in everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   So he added Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballe singing German,
Maire Brennan singing Gaelic, Pietro Ballo singing French and
Zucchero singing Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about the Christmas album, it's something you
could put on in the middle of July _ it doesn't have to be
Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moloney did some traveling to work with the acts before
recording, but he admits much of it was prepared from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulgarian Voices sent me five songs, and I thought they
fit perfectly into my European plan,'' he said. ``Most of this was
done by telephone; I'd say, `Give me some space here, I want to put
some harp on and some bow.' I didn't have time to go to Sofia.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder. Moloney worked nonstop from early January to
late July this year with the Chieftains, who were on the road
promoting their ``Tears of Stone'' CD featuring Bonnie Raitt, Joni
Mitchell, Natalie Merchant and other guests. Then there's his
record company, Wicklow Records, where Moloney enjoys being his own
boss.
</P>
<P>
   More recently he was mixing the tracks of another
yet-to-be-titled Chieftains album, due in stores next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been after me saying, `When are you going to do an
Irish album,''' he said. ``It's done. I did a lot of on-location
live recordings in mansions and pubs, musicians coming together and
playing and going for it. And it came out quite nicely. It's good
to get back to recharge the batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   What Moloney and the rest of the Chieftains are preparing for
now is a very unusual millennium concert. They've been hired to
perform New Year's Eve aboard an invitation-only cruise to
Antarctica, with Art Garfunkel and Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be sailing under a dormant volcano,'' Moloney said. ``I
believe the acoustics are great, so we should sound good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Moloney still talks about his dream that the Chieftains, now
in their 36th year, be the first band to play on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   All this as he turns 60, a time in life when others talk about
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great kickoff age for me,'' he said. ``I work 18
hours every day for me. I've never worked so hard in my life.''

FEARING Y2K, SURVIVALISTS HEAD TO THE HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ark., Texas)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROY BRAGG  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DAVIS, Texas _ Some doomsayers believe the Y2K computer bug
will spark global shortages and chaos. But if it happens, odds are
it will not affect life in places such as Warbonnet or Crow's Nest.
</P>
<P>
   High in the Davis Mountains of western Texas, at the end of
steep, rutted roads and across gaping granite canyons, these are
places barely accessible by vehicle and are occupied by people who,
as far as the modern world is concerned, have ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The area long has been one of those places where people go, for
various reasons, to drop off the map. Now, for those who fear what
2000 brings, there's another reason to hide.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the reclusive businessman who has built
his own private sanctuary here in a rough-hewn stretch of the Texas
badlands.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who have seen his place describe buried propane tanks,
new water wells, a barn full of freeze-dried food and a military
surplus armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have met the property owner describe him as polite and
intelligent. And secretive.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the Y2K survivalists, the name given to people
afraid of fallout when some computer systems, unable to recognize
the 2000 as the valid follow-up to 1999, try to roll over to the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government and most businesses say the
country is well prepared for the new year, hard-core survivalists
envision a world that hasn't prepared adequately for certain
systemic computer crashes. That, in turn, will create an
apocalyptic world akin to the post-nuclear wastelands of the ``Mad
Max'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many frightened people have taken to
the hills, but experts say there could be thousands _ hunkered down
with months' worth of food, a self-sufficient power system and a
strong feeling that the modern world will end in January.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists and anthropologists studying Y2K survivalists say
they are just a variation of an ever-present subculture in American
life. For those people, the end is always near.
</P>
<P>
   ``They begin with the ideas that they're already waiting for
some kind of collapse,'' said David Frankfurter, an associate
professor of religious studies and history at the University of New
Hampshire in Durham. ``In a way, they know the world's going to
hell and the end of time is coming and Christ is coming back. Even
though everyone else thinks things are getting better, (to them)
it's just a conspiracy to keep us ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Lamy, associate professor of sociology and anthropology
at Castleton College in Castleton, Vt., calls it the ``Millennium
Myth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an uncertain, chaotic world, a world where you don't
believe in any of your institutions, how do you find any answers?
How do you get a grip on what's going on? You plug into the
Millennium Myth. (The Y2K bug) is another one of those plagues or
times that God predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has been more vigilant and virulent on the subject than
doomsayer Gary North, a former computer programmer, historian and
Y2K survivalist. On his Web site, www.garynorth.com, he states
flatly that our time is up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean that society is running out of time to fix this
problem,'' North writes on his Internet site. ``Society has already
run out of time for that. There are not enough programmers to fix
it. The technical problems cannot be fixed on a systemwide basis.
The Millennium Bug will hit in 2000, no matter what those in
authority decide to do now. As a system, the world economy is now
beyond the point of no return. We are running out of time as
individuals to evade the falling dominoes.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't North's first stab at Armageddon. In the 1970s, he
predicted nuclear holocaust would engulf the planet in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he predicted the world would be decimated by the
AIDS plague in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And North, like the Fort Davis landowner, declined repeated
requests for interviews. The staff at his Tyler office said he has
moved to northwest Arkansas, also a magnet for Y2K survivalists.
</P>
<P>
   When survivalists venture out of the woods, many go to
Huntsville, Ark., the seat of Madison County, to stock up on
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cotton, a real estate agent there, said many bought land in
1998 and the first half of 1999. Like western Texas, northwest
Arkansas already has drawn people who have wanted to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are nice,'' Cotton said. ``They don't want to be
bothered. They don't want any publicity at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in on the Y2K hoopla is North, who gives seminars on Y2K
preparedness and packages his speeches and tips in the newsletter
``Remnant Review.''
</P>
<P>
   For optimistic nihilists among his readers, North _ who predicts
a banking collapse and other financial catastrophes _ offers a
two-year subscription to the Remnant Review.

DISARMED SHERIFF, FACING FEDERAL CHARGES, REMAINS ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEARSALL, Texas _ The sheriff here is forbidden to carry a gun
and, at the Golden Fried Chicken, where coffee costs 40 cents and
talk is even cheaper, regulars sometimes wonder if he should be
locked in the jail he oversees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apart from gossip and the holster missing from his hip,
there are few reminders that a year ago, FBI agents accused Frio
County Sheriff Carl Burris of stealing cash and selling marijuana,
which had been seized from smugglers and stored at his office.
</P>
<P>
   Burris is not allowed to handle firearms while he remains free
on bond. But, innocent until proven otherwise, the hulking, affable
52-year-old sheriff is still on the job. He has a year left in
office, and he said he would seek a third term. What little he
would say about the case is cryptic, yet optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are working themselves out,'' he said. ``I think
they're talking about dropping everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Frio County, some 40 miles southwest of San Antonio, is a
sparsely populated rectangle of brush and farmland. Its larger
towns cling to Interstate 35, the asphalt corridor that carries
away peanut harvests and, by many accounts, ushers in more than the
county's share of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Burris was charged with trying to sell 62 pounds of marijuana in
an attempt to replace $11,726 of seized drug profits that a former
deputy alleges the sheriff pocketed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, residents, from county leaders to patrons at the
Paraiso bar, are perplexed by the seeming inaction of federal
authorities, who accused the sheriff of being crooked and then fell
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took his gun away from him. That's it,'' said one
resident, who like many others insisted on anonymity, saying he
feared retribution in this county of some 16,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still just hanging in limbo,'' said another resident.
``I really feel like we've been dumped on.''
</P>
<P>
   The thin case file at the federal courthouse in San Antonio
reveals little. As of last week, it held orders granting Burris
permission to travel, but nothing of substance beyond the initial
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities, however, insist the case has neither fallen
apart nor has been forgotten. But citing rules that forbid them
from discussing cases still open, they neither confirm nor deny
that a dismissal is in the works for Burris.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Durbin, chief of the criminal division for the U.S.
Attorney's Office in San Antonio, said the case remains active.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the case appears to have followed a
bizarre pace.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of slow investigation, authorities lurched
forward Dec. 8, 1998, with the sudden arrest of the sheriff. In
order to hold and charge him, they filed a criminal complaint
instead of seeking a grand jury indictment, a legal shortcut often
viewed as a sign of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Don Kidd, a former FBI special agent, said he was ``amazed''
that the authorities would arrest an elected official without first
obtaining the indictment needed to bring him to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, investigators line ``all their ducks in a row'' before
they act, especially in corruption cases that receive intense
scrutiny within the Justice Department, said Kidd, now with the
University of Arkansas-affiliated Criminal Justice Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Burris complaint enabled the authorities to march the
shackled sheriff past camera crews and into court, where a federal
magistrate informed him of the allegations. He was then held
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The case appeared to come to a standstill after the arrest. If
Burris has been indicted, prosecutors have kept it under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been nothing _ no developments at all,'' said Alfredo
Villarreal, the federal public defender representing Burris.
</P>
<P>
   Burris is hardly impatient.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after being released, he waived his right to a speedy
trial, an unusual move that lifted legal requirements that he be
indicted within 30 days of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, Burris sounds relaxed for a man threatened with
charges that carry up to 15 years in prison and could end a 20-year
career in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   His easygoing tone is perhaps a reminder that the former Olmos
Park police officer has been exonerated before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after a short trial, a state judge acquitted Burris of
charges that he and a Frio County constable solicited a bribe by
tearing up a traffic ticket in exchange for a shotgun and
semiautomatic assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Burris faces incriminating videotapes and wire
recordings, according to an affidavit by an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed affidavit alleges that Burris, who earns $32,030 a
year, first pocketed $11,726 seized from smugglers. And later, when
investigators asked about the money, the sheriff tried selling a
bundle of seized marijuana, the proceeds of which he intended to
use to replace the apparently missing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As described in the federal affidavit, the case appears a
classic case of ``gotcha.''
</P>
<P>
   But skepticism grows as, month after month, Burris remains in
his office, beyond the trophy case of brass knuckles, switchblades
and other jailhouse contraband that greets visitors to the
Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, when you have a good case you go forward with
it,'' said Jay Sorrell, a Pearsall attorney who backed Burris in
his previous campaigns and remains a supporter, although he has
since moved from the county.
</P>
<P>
   To legal experts, delays in criminal cases usually reflect one
of two possibilities: weak proof or both sides are working on some
sort of deal.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's supporters scoff at the suggestion Burris would
brazenly pilfer from his office safe roughly one month after he was
cleared of bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was a setup,'' said Ken Grand, a former columnist
for the locally published and now defunct South Texas News.
``Carl's not going to jeopardize his career by taking money out to
go on vacation. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris bristles at any suggestion he is providing information to
the federal investigators or even preparing a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not cutting any deals, OK?'' he said.

 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In Rick Pitino's best-selling business book, ``Success
is a Choice,'' the Boston Celtics coach urges readers to recapture
the optimism of youth in their lives and careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to feel once again that the world is full of
possibilities,'' Pitino says.
</P>
<P>
   The heralded coach clearly follows his own advice. When it comes
to Pitino's life and career, the possibilities seemingly are
endless.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing a variety of ventures away from the parquet floor,
Pitino has created an extensive shadow career. He may not yet have
the fortunes of the Boston Celtics turned around, but he is
creating his own fortune. Neither Pitino nor his representatives
would comment, but information culled from his business partners
and from observers suggests that his ancillary incomes add at least
25 percent to his annual coaching salary of $5 million _ and closer
to 40 percent in a year when he publishes a book.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino is one of a tiny group of coaches capable of using their
talents as communicators and motivators to develop lucrative
enterprises on the side. While coaches have long sought additional
incomes from things like shoe endorsements and local television
shows, Pitino is a leading example of a more recent trend: the
coach as conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a select group that also includes Bill Parcells and John
Madden from the NFL and Pat Riley and Phil Jackson in the NBA,''
said Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a
Chicago company that links advertisers with sports figures. ``They
are attractive to the business world and intelligent enough to know
how to take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, suggest that Pitino's marketability has
been diminished by the lack of a quick turnaround in the Celtics'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has been held back by three things: the NBA strike,
the poor performance of the team, and the fact that he commands top
dollar,'' said a marketing official at a major Boston firm, who
requested anonymity. ``When your team is in the tank, you're not
that popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that, away from the Celtics, this coach
could almost call himself Pitino Inc. _ a far-flung, highly
diversified corporation that walks on two legs.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the most highly paid motivational speakers in the
country, much in demand by Fortune 500 companies that, according to
observers, pay him $40,000 to $60,000 per appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be one of the best speakers I have ever heard in my
life,'' said Matt Meli, a senior vice president for J. Walter
Thompson, the advertising firm that represents Ford Motor Co. in
its sponsorship of the Celtics _ a $250,000-per-year deal that
includes personal appearances by Pitino, but no direct fee for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone involved with Ford feels really good about spending
money with the team, in part because he is such a fine
ambassador,'' Meli said.
</P>
<P>
   As a pitchman for Citizens Bank, Pitino earns $250,000 per year,
Williams estimates. He is now in the third year of a five-year
contract. Citizens' commercials featuring Pitino air 12 to 15 times
a week, increasing to 20 when the Celtics are in town for a series
of home games, said Peter Joyce, vice president and brand director
of Citizens' advertising firm, Holland Mark Edmund Ingalls, in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As a commercial spokesman for Rodman Ford, of Hyde Park and
Norwood, Pitino earns another $75,000 to $100,000, Williams said.
The commercials appear most often on cable channels, especially
those featuring sports, said Dan Rodman, president of Rodman Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The coach is also an author.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino's first motivational book, for Broadway Books/Random
House, topped The New York Times bestseller list for business books
for the entire month of March 1997. That means, for that month
alone, Pitino was earning about $3.50 per book on sales of at least
80,000 books, according to publishing industry sources. Spokeswomen
for Broadway Books would not reveal the total number of sales, but
the company claims at least 500,000 readers for the book,
co-written with a Providence Journal-Bulletin sports columnist,
Bill Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   A second motivational book _ its working title is ``Lead to
Succeed,'' Reynolds said _ is slated for publication in May, just
in time to be a gift idea for Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``The Rick Pitino Show'' on WBZ-TV. It airs at 11
a.m. on Sundays, when it has about a 3 rating _ meaning that it is
watched in about 190,000 households, or 8 percent of the homes
using television at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The rebroadcast of the show, at 12:30 a.m. on Monday, has about
a 3 rating and a 9 share.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said that Pitino is paid a flat fee for the
program and owns no production rights, including any opportunity to
benefit directly from the sale of advertising for the show. A
spokeswoman for WBZ-TV would not reveal any details about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also owns thoroughbred racehorses _ including the
fourth-place finisher in the 1998 Kentucky Derby, Halory Hunter.
Pitino purchased the horse for $135,000; it earned $713,120 in its
racing career and is now garnering stud fees.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if he needed more to do, Pitino is a purveyor of six
types of pasta, three sauces and two salsas. His income from
Louisville, Ky.-based Pitino Foods comes from an undisclosed
royalty that he is paid off the top, and from his take as a 25
percent shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   All of that money goes to the Daniel Pitino Foundation, a
charity named after his infant son who died in 1987 of congenital
conditions, said Salvatore Rubino, who helps run Pitino Foods. That
money is then disbursed, by Pitino, to various children's charities
in Massachusetts, including Children's Hospital and The Make a Wish
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   According to records in the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney
General, the Kentucky-based foundation received about $957,000 in
contributions and revenue in the year ending March 31 and
distributed about $466,000 to charities. It spent about $477,000 on
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   All of Pitino's side interests are in addition to serving full
time as both president and head coach of the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done very well, and it is his reputation as a coach and
the power of his personality that is driving all of this,'' said
Patrick McGee, a vice president at Octagon Athlete Representation
in Virginia. ``The guy is just a charismatic leader, and he has
been so great with underdogs throughout his career and bringing
teams back from bad times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch a game and you watch him and the way he coaches
and how much it all means to him and what he instills in those
guys, he makes you want to root for him,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   What companies like about Pitino _ and about coaches like
Parcells, Riley, and Jackson _ is that they are easily recognizable
symbols of both success and good management.
</P>
<P>
   ``If corporations are looking for spokespeople or motivational
speakers, they want to associate with a winner,'' said Peter Land,
general manager of the sports and entertainment marketing practice
at Edelman Public Relations Worldwide in New York. Land is also a
former director of marketing communications for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches also are people managers, and that's what we do in
business every day,'' Land said. ``Those successful NBA coaches
blend the skills of 12 individuals, hoping to come up with a
victorious result. It is not that different from any other
workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino refuses to talk about all of the moonlighting _ at least
until after the basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season, as far as Rick is concerned, it is all
about basketball,'' said Jeff Twiss, the Celtics' spokesman.
``After the season, he'd be happy to talk about it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pitino _ the acclaimed communicator, who
preaches that doing it well is a key to success _ knows he should
not be talking about his nonbasketball business during the season,
especially when he is so far from accomplishing his goal of
bringing an NBA championship back to a storied franchise. His
instincts clearly tell him that it would only send the players, the
fans and his boss, Celtics owner Paul Gaston, the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   Some who are watching Pitino spin out his successes off the
court wonder when and if the on-the-court performance of the team _
which clearly is not at the top level _ will begin to affect his
ancillary ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, spokesmen for two major companies in Boston said that
after listening to pitches from Pitino, they decided not to hire
him to represent the companies. Both spokesmen requested anonymity
for themselves and their firms. ``We may not have been interested,
regardless, but three things have sort of come together to hurt him
_ the NBA strike, the poor performance of the team, and the fact
that he commands top dollar,'' said one of the spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches shun the extracurricular work until they get their
teams on the right track. McGee said his firm has tried to
encourage Washington Redskins coach Norv Turner to take advantage
of several business opportunties offered to him and to begin
cultivating others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't do it,'' McGee said. ``He says, `I can't really do
anything until I win. I don't want to be out in front of my players
making money before we have some success.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But other observers say that Pitino's record as a successful
coach _ and as a successful businessman _ was so well established
before he got to the Celtics that it makes little difference if the
team is losing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they say, it is acknowledged that the Celtics were in a
deep hole when the franchise hired Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anytime soon this guy's public image and
marketability are (going to be) diminished by the Celtics'
performance,'' Land said. ``From one year to the next in the NBA,
it is very difficult to have that kind of seismic transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all a long way from the early 1980s, when Pitino had an
apartment in Kenmore Square and walked to his job at Boston
University. He is not only a coach of considerable repute, whose
contract with the storied Celtics franchise rewrote the rules on
how much money NBA coaches are worth, but an accomplished
businessman, best-selling author, and speaker of national acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just love the guy,'' Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
   The auto dealership has an annual Ride for Kids, a bike tour
that last September raised $1.3 million for five agencies serving
youths in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him if he would help in any way, and he went way
beyond the call,'' Rodman said. ``He came to our breakfast and gave
a tremendous motivational speech about the importance of
cooperation and teamwork, and then he supported the event
financially with a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the few guys out there in sports that's still the
full package. When he does a deal with you, he supports you with
his time, energy and even money. He brings it all with him.''

His brother William followed him, then his sister Alice's two sons,
his sister Mary's son, his sister Katherine's son, and William's
two sons. Eventually, 11 McGuirks joined the department, including
Joseph McGuirk, 38, who perished in the warehouse fire Friday. By

CHAT BEFORE YOU MAKE A DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ I recently ``overheard'' several travelers engaged in
a lively conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Some excerpts:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm thinking about using Priceline for a Walt Disney World
vacation. We are not going until August. Would it be best to submit
a bid now or would we get a better deal if we waited? Thinking of
submitting a $45 bid for a 3-star hotel. What do you think?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I would not recommend using Priceline this far in advance.
Remember, what you get is nonrefundable and nonchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I put in a bid of $45 for an Orlando airport hotel for Jan.
11 and got a room at the Sheraton.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Here are winning bids for Walt Disney World-area hotels that
I am aware of: Wyndham Orlando, $50; Hampton Inn, $50; Marriott
World Plaza, $90; Hyatt Kissimmee, $60. ...''
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't another advertisement for Priceline.com. None of
the ``voices'' above is William Shatner's.
</P>
<P>
   It's just casual chat around the neighborhood _ albeit a vast
online neighborhood. And while the conversationalists are quick to
tout a bargain find, they aren't shy in citing disappointments
either.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in this discussion are among 115 members in an
online travel club begun 3 1/2 months ago by Houstonian Sheryl
Mexic. The forum (accessed at
http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/pricelinedeals) is dedicated to
fostering a better understanding of the bidding system associated
with flights and hotel stays booked through Priceline _ a
fast-growing company that, if my correspondence is any gauge, has
both fascinated and confounded many travelers. To a lesser extent,
lodging arranged via Expedia's Hotel Price Matcher service also is
covered.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of thousands of forums open to free participation on
the Internet. Indeed, individuals all over the world spend hours
talking about sports, politics, movies _ and almost every
imaginable aspect of travel.
</P>
<P>
   As a novice, I accessed http://clubs.yahoo.com _ one of several
addresses devoted to interactive conversation _ and clicked on the
``travel'' icon to get an idea of what's available. I'll concede my
astonishment at discovering clubs whose topics range from dude
ranching to whale watching.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo site alone includes 73 cruise-related clubs, 58 with
lodging reviews, 25 clubs for backpackers, 19 for rail aficionados
and 15 for motorcycle tourists. The scope varies: The Travel
Corner, a multipurpose forum, includes 1,247 members while Real
Surfing Real Surfers hopes to crest above its five current
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Two clubs are dedicated only to ghost towns, although the first
entry I encountered read _ perhaps appropriately _ ``This site sure
isn't very active.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen travel-related Yahoo clubs are geared specifically to
seniors, 20 to singles, 16 to women, eight to teen-agers and 23 to
gay and lesbian travelers.
</P>
<P>
   And Yahoo clubs merely scratch the surface of available travel
chat:
</P>
<P>
   At www.smarterliving.com, forum topics range from cruising with
children to ``What are you doing New Year's Eve?''
</P>
<P>
   At www.fodors.com, a forum on skiing has started.
</P>
<P>
   At http://talk.webflyer.com, business travelers chat not only
with each other but with Randy Petersen, the acknowledged guru of
frequent flyer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Mexic, an active participant in numerous forums, began her club
in August. It costs nothing, she says, to form a Yahoo club; nor
does she receive any remuneration. She has no affiliation with
Priceline or Expedia. ``I'm just a person with expensive tastes who
relishes a good bargain,'' she says. ``And I enjoy sharing that
bargain with others.''
</P>
<P>
   As an administrative assistant for a Houston business, Mexic
began utilizing Priceline not for herself but to find deals for
co-workers. She maintained a record of each successful bid and
gradually developed a strategy, elements of which she passes along
to other club members. Now, member input helps Mexic and other
participants expand on that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexic applauds the basic Priceline concept by which individuals
name the price they are willing to pay (a bid) for air or lodging
on a certain date. For air travel, no carrier or time of day can be
specified; for hotels, no one property can be requested, but
bidders choose from an arbitrary ratings system _ 3-star, 4-star,
etc. _ and pinpoint an area such as ``airport'' or ``downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Mexic says, ``I can't stress enough the importance of doing
your homework. Before making a hotel bid, check each chain's Web
site to see what prices are available for your travel dates. That
gives you a guide. Check for other air fare deals, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never bid too high. I can think of only one time that my first
bid was accepted. But that's good. If that first bid is accepted, I
start wondering, `How much lower should I have gone?'''
</P>
<P>
   As for regulations that restrict the number of bids allowed,
Mexic's strategy covers that angle, too.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite bargain? Mexic paid $50 per night for a room at
Houston's deluxe Luxury Collection Hotel during the Thanksgiving
holiday period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can generally get really good deals, too, at downtown New
York City hotels on weekends, though not in December,'' she says.
``I've seen bids accepted for $80 per night on weekends and
$100-$120 per night on weekdays at Sheraton hotels in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Her main concern about Priceline? ``When you bid for a 4-star
hotel and arrive to find 3-star or 2-star quality, there needs to
be a recourse,'' she says. ``Quality can vary greatly even within
the same chain.'' Members are encouraged to post reports on
properties where their bids are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Readers intrigued by Mexic's club _ or by other travel-related
forums _ can first access and read postings without joining.
Information about free membership is provided.

HOLIDAY BOOKS THAT WILL MAKE GREAT GIFTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
and HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fulfill the wanderlust of a friend or family member with a
guidebook this holiday season. Here are some that we'd be proud to
give or receive:
</P>
<P>
   Title of the year goes to ``100 Things to Do Before You Die:
Travel Events You Just Can't Miss'' (Taylor, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   Authors Neil Teplica and Dave Freeman are founders of
WhatsGoingOn.com, and their book reflects the Web site's addiction
to adventure and adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   While serving up familiar events such as the Academy Awards
ceremony in Los Angeles and Bastille Day in Paris, the book also
introduces exotic treats. Among them: the National Hollerin'
Contest in North Carolina, the Chung Yuan Ghost Month Festival in
Taiwan, and Hogmanay, described as the ``boisterous, boozy,
soulful, and very Scottish way to ring in the new year.''
</P>
<P>
   Using icons to denote events that are ``dangerous'' or ``grandma
approved,'' the book is fun reading. But we grumble at the authors'
decision to give only their own Web site as a resource for
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein is Alan S. Davis' ``The Fun Also Rises:
International Travel Guide'' (Greenline, $19.95). But Davis gets
the prize _ and our praise _ for thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to presenting 50 travel destinations keyed to
special events, Davis suggests three-day, fun-filled itineraries
for each city and provides contact numbers for hotels, restaurants
and attractions. Among events featured are the Cape Minstrel
Festival in South Africa, the Vienna Opera Ball in Austria and
Trinidad's Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, Davis also includes his Millennium List, which
charts 100 of the most fun U.S. and international events in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers to David D'Aprix and his ``Non-Connoisseur's Menu Guide''
(Living Language, $10.95). D'Aprix offers straightforward advice on
how to dine in foreign countries without feeling foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into three sections (French, Italian and Spanish/Latin
American), the guide tackles each cuisine from ``apertif'' to
after-dinner drink. Along the way, readers discover ``feijoada,'' a
stew and the national dish of Brazil; the origins of Fettuccini
Alfredo; and that, ``oui,'' it is common for one person to order
two desserts in France.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tips on regional dishes and beverages, the guide
lists spices, sauces and preparation techniques that can aid in
deciphering a menu. Also helpful is the pronunciations for foreign
words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   After all that eating, you may want to check out ``Traveling on
the Run: A Complete Guide to Fitness &AMP; Running Around the World''
(SIMS, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   Written by Stewart and Barbara Sims, this guide covers more than
90 cities in remarkable detail. Many are obvious tourist centers
such as New York, Sydney and Paris, but the guide also includes
places such as Baton Rouge, La., Birmingham, Ala., and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Maps accompanying each city pinpoint running routes, hotels with
fitness facilities, tourist attractions and other landmarks. Each
city listing also includes running clubs and retail stores that
cater to athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Chapters dedicated to marathon training, stretching and a list
of sports medicine doctors round out this comprehensive guide.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating its 26th Jubilee, Rome is anticipating more than 30
million visitors, nearly triple its average, in 2000. To help
pilgrims and tourists navigate their way through the crush, Fodor's
offers ``Holy Rome: A Millennium Guide to the Christian Sights''
($21).
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy Rome'' takes readers through the city's Christian
history, from Paul's arrival in 61 AD to Pope John Paul II. Along
the way, the guide's Italian authors _ all experts on religious
history and art _ share fascinating tales of faith and saints. For
the traveler, there is comprehensive coverage of attractions such
as the basilica of St. Maria in Trastevere, the Chiaramonti Museum
and the Appian Way, which linked Rome to southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 230 color photographs, this slick publication is
as much Christian keepsake as guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   Online addicts may find Ken Leebow's ``300 Incredible Things for
Travelers on the Internet'' (300 Incredible.com, $8.95) a bit
basic, but this paperback is a valuable guide for anyone just
starting to weave through a wide-ranging Web of travel information.
</P>
<P>
   Leebow, billed as ``Mr. Internet,'' specifies 300 travel-related
categories, beginning with large multipurpose sites. Addresses that
focus on transportation, lodging, attractions and overall trip
planning are recommended. He tells where to find information on
state and national parks; how to locate a listing of more than
100,000 restaurants in 47 countries; where to access details on
rental properties throughout the world; and how to reach
out-of-town newspapers' online sites.
</P>
<P>
   Want to take a virtual tour of Elvis Presley's Graceland? Study
evaluations of various cruise lines? Access an up-to-date snow
report at a ski resort? Leebow points the way.
</P>
<P>
   This is another in a series that already includes ``300
Incredible Things for Kids on the Internet,'' ``300 Incredible
Things for Sports Fans on the Internet'' and ``300 Incredible
Things for Beanie Lovers on the Internet.'' Twenty volumes are
planned by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Another solid new electronic-media resource is the ``Vacation
Travel Mart's Online Travel Guide &AMP; Logbook'' (Britannia Travel
Press, $12.95) by Jacques Abita and Jim Woodman.
</P>
<P>
   The premise and organization of this 256-page paperback is
simple: Listings are provided (alphabetically) for official Web
sites and other recommended online services in nations throughout
the world and for U.S. states and major cities and Canadian
provinces. Toll-free numbers for requesting information (and
airline Web sites and toll-free numbers) also are included.
</P>
<P>
   The spiral-bound book is designed for use beside a computer and
includes pages for notations.
</P>
<P>
   Write to Britannia Travel Press, 17250 Collins Ave., Sunny Isles
Beach, Fla. 33160.
</P>
<P>
   It's a publication you hope you'll never need to use. But just
in case ... ``The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook''
(Chronicle Books, $14.95), by Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht,
offers tips on such unlikely (we hope) happenstances as ``How to
Win a Swordfight,'' ``How to Ram a Car'' and ``How to Survive if
You are in the Line of Gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The relevance to travel, you ask? Much of the treatise is
general in scope, but adventure travelers may want to take heed of
``How to Escape from Quicksand,'' ``How to Fend Off a Shark,''
``How to Escape from Killer Bees,'' ``How to Get to the Surface if
Your Scuba Tank Runs Out of Air'' or ``How to Survive When Lost in
the Mountains (or Desert).''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is ``How to Deliver a Baby in a Taxicab'' and
``How to Land a Plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you won't find many other books whose advisory board
includes physicians, stuntmen, bomb squad officers, bullfighters,
locksmiths, alligator farmers, demolition derby drivers and
avalanche rescue patrol members.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Family Travel: The Farther You Go, The Closer You Get''
(Travelers' Tales, $17.95), Laura Manske edits a compilation of 45
personal stories about, as she puts it, ``devotion and affection,
fervor and yearning, laughter and surprise _ about embracing family
history, about better understanding the immediate family, about
becoming a new family.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributors include Paul Reiser, Michael Crichton, Calvin
Trillin, Mary Morris and Robert Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Like other volumes in the award-winning Travelers' Tales series,
this is an ideal vacation companion in that most stories are less
than 10 pages in length. When the family is ready to play, you can
put it down and easily resume later. Chances are that most
contributions here will rekindle memories _ or remind that a family
vacation is long overdue.

MOW PECAN LEAVES AS THEY COME DOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: Would it be all right to leave my pecan leaves on
my lawn and just mow over them, or would it ruin my grass?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can mow and mulch the leaves into small bits that will
easily break down. But I would do this on a fairly regular basis,
say weekly, until all the leaves have fallen. It's difficult to
plow through a thick layer.
</P>
<P>
   More important, you want to avoid a layer of leaves that blocks
light and air from reaching your grass _ whether the leaves are
pecan, oak or sycamore. If there's already a heavy layer on your
lawn, you might rake and bag most of the leaves, then run the mower
over those remaining. But don't put the bags by the curb. Instead
use that good organic matter in your garden. We bag excess leaves,
add a little water and set the bags aside to make leaf mold. Then
we gradually add the leaf mold to the compost pile.
</P>
<P>
   You also could just spread some of the leaves out in your beds.
Do the same with leaf mold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and what do I feed my satsuma?
</P>
<P>
   A: Usually, citrus requires only nitrogen. You can apply a
nitrogen fertilizer monthly from March through August on young
trees. The amount depends on the age of the tree and the size of
the trunk. A 1-year-old tree would take 1/4 cup of ammonium nitrate
per inch of trunk diameter. A 3-year-old tree would take 1 cup per
inch of trunk diameter a foot off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus is considered mature at 4 years, so all you should need
is an application of nitrogen in March (1 cup per inch of
diameter). Water it well. You can substitute cottonseed meal at the
rate of 9 quarts per inch of diameter. It takes more, but it costs
less, and it's organic. Cut back if the tree is growing too well.
You don't want excessive growth.
</P>
<P>
   Satsumas are sweet, virtually seedless and cold-tolerant to 20
degrees or slightly below. Keep in mind that while hardy citrus
plants can tolerate cold, the fruit won't, so either pick it or
protect it. The fruit will freeze and split.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus prefers a slightly acidic soil, but while it is not
overly picky and is tolerant of sand or clay, good drainage is
important. Plant high, with the graft union well above soil level,
to prevent the roots from being too wet and to avoid foot rot
disease. Then mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus requires minimum pruning. Remove suckers and dead or
diseased wood as they appear, but while you may want to
occasionally shape your tree, heavier pruning may slow fruit
production if you remove too much foliage. If a tree becomes leggy,
prune (preferably in February) to promote branching and give it
more light.
</P>
<P>
   As your tree matures, it will yield heavier crops. Flower and
fruit drop is common, and there's nothing you can do about it. Less
fruit can mean larger fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Satsumas attract swallowtail butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have crab grass that is taking over my front beds. I have
tried two herbicides. I have dug the weeds out, down to the roots.
These are 6 to 10 inches beneath the surface. Can you recommend
something to wipe the crab grass out without killing my roses and
hibiscus in the process?
</P>
<P>
   One of my plumerias bloomed this summer. I noticed long, hard
pods about two weeks after the blooms were gone. What are they, and
is there anything special I should do about them this winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since the weed is in your flowers, I would recommend digging,
even though it's a pain, then placing a 2- to 3-inch layer of mulch
in the bed to at least slow the return of the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Crab grass is a warm-season annual, so it may die out soon. To
try to prevent it from reappearing later, apply a pre-emergent
herbicide about two weeks before the last anticipated frost _
usually the end of February. A second application 90 days later
might also prove helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I care for a large schefflera and am enclosing a few leaves
to show my problems. It is near a large window and receives
filtered light from the morning sun. I've been told the spots are
sunburn and the lighter-colored leaves could be from a lack of
light. The lighter leaves started near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is difficult to get a good reading from leaves that are
mailed, as they are often damaged. But see the following for
possible answers to your problems.
</P>
<P>
   Improper watering is often the trouble with indoor plants,
especially in cooler weather. If there are crisp, brown spots or
patches on the leaves, underwatering is likely the cause. If there
are soft, dark-brown areas, the plant is receiving too much water.
</P>
<P>
   If the foliage has straw-colored spots or patches, the cause
could be watering with cold water, water splashing on the leaves or
too much sun. Avoid hot, direct rays. Scheffleras like bright
indirect sun.
</P>
<P>
   If an occasional lower leaf yellows and falls, don't worry. This
is normal. If several bottom leaves yellow at the same time and
drop, the plant is getting too much water. Or the plant could be in
a cold draft.
</P>
<P>
   Should leaves at the top yellow but remain firm, the cause could
be the use of hard water. City water can contain a lot of calcium,
which ties up the iron in the soil. When a plant cannot absorb
needed iron, as well as magnesium, the result is yellowish leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Flush the soil occasionally to wash away unwanted buildups.
Fertilize your plant biweekly or monthly during warm months.
Sprinkle Epsom salts, a magnesium source, around the pot (and water
in) two or three times a year to help unleash needed nutrients.
Iron chelate, applied according to package directions, will boost
iron supplies and in turn help green up your plant.
</P>
<P>
   When you water, make sure it drains well. Empty any water in the
saucer. Do not water again until the soil is dry to the touch. Use
your finger to test moisture down in the pot. Sometimes when the
bottom is wet and the top is dry, we water, but the roots are
already getting sufficient moisture. Scheffleras seem to do best in
lightly moist soil.

Jewel/``Joy: A Holiday Collection'' (Atlantic) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hark! The blond bombshell sings. On this yuletide set, the
folk-pop chanteuse and dewy poet's third album, Jewel offers 13
seasonal favorites and new originals. Along with perfectly
respectable renditions of standards ``Silent Night,'' ``Hark! The
Herald Angels Sing,'' ``Joy to the World'' and ``O Little Town of
Bethlehem'' the 25-year-old reworks her recent hit, ``Hands,'' in
Christmas mode (``In the end, only kindness matters'') adding
bells, horns and chimes. Also included are two new tunes: ``Face of
Love,'' an expression of faith that soars on the strength of the
vocals, and ``Gloria,'' inspired by a J.S. Bach mass. Produced with
deft precision by veteran studio ace Arif Mardin, ``Joy: A Holiday
Collection'' should keep the embers glowing in many homes this
season. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Various/``Mr. Hanky's Christmas Classics'' (Columbia) &QL; 
Various/``Touched by an Angel: The Christmas Album'' (Epic) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Proof positive that there's a Christmas album for every taste _
heretics and high-minded alike. ``Mr. Hanky's Christmas Classics''
(3 stars) comes courtesy of the ``South Park'' gang and features a
very appropriate parental advisory warning. It's the only place
you'll find Christmas songs voiced by Satan and Adolf Hitler, not
to mention Mr. Hanky singing ``Christmas Poo.'' But like this
year's movie, the album is as funny as it is offensive, skewering
as it does Christmas music conventions and holiday traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Touched by an Angel'' (2 1/2 stars) compilation is a
rather predictable affair with plenty of lush holiday ballads
delivered with plenty of conviction by middle-of-the-road artists
like Amy Grant, Keb' Mo' and Randy Travis. The stars of the series
_ Della Reese and Roma Downey _ open and close the festivities with
heartfelt selections that will undoubtedly touch the show's
faithful. &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Al DiMeola/``Winter Nights'' (Telarc) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This album from master guitarist DiMeola belongs beside Windham
Hill's better ``Winter Solstice'' offerings. Working with Ukranian
bandura player Roman Hrynkiv, DiMeola plays acoustic guitar,
keyboards and percussion instruments on delicate versions of
seasonal gems and lovely original compositions. Songs like Peter
Gabriel's ``Mercy Street'' and Simon and Garfunkel's ``Scarborough
Fair'' add to the peaceful, wintry vibe. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Various/``Christmas Around the Country II'' (NPR Classics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No need to wait for Christmas Day to hear some of the best
holiday music from National Public Radio's ``Performance Today''
program. NPR has assembled 24 tracks of mostly live recordings
aired on Christmases past that capture the worldwide scope of the
holiday yet sound surprisingly compatible. The performers represent
the creme de la creme of their fields, including the Lionheart
vocal ensemble, the Handbell Ensemble Sonos and mezzo soprano
Denyce Graves. But the most amazing tracks, including a dreamlike
contemporary arrangement of a 500-year-old German carol, are
mesmerizing. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Valerie Kuklenski &QR; 
 &QL; 
Nat King Cole/``The Christmas Song'' (Capitol) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas Song'' stands as one of the most enduring tunes
of the century, and Nat King Cole sings the definitive version of
the classic. On this reissue, there are three versions of the
timeless standard, including Cole's original 1946 recording and a
decently engineered duet with daughter Natalie, a la
``Unforgettable.'' Interestingly enough, ``The Christmas Song'' is
the only nontraditional song on this album of Christian hymns. Cole
invests each with plenty of warmth and feeling, making this an
album that just gets better with each Christmas season. 3 1/2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Ray Brown Trio/``Christmas Songs'' (Telarc) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bassist Ray Brown swings into the Christmas season with plenty
of help from some of the jazz world's top singers. Diana Krall, Dee
Dee Bridgewater and Kevin Mahogany are among the singers helping
out on this program of popular Christmas favorites, backed by Brown
and his trio, along with guitarist Russell Malone and sax player
Ralph Moore. The singers often stick a little too closely to
familiar readings of the songs, but the bluesy backing never wavers
in its joyful intensity. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QR; 
 &QL; 
Jimi Hendrix/``Merry Christmas and Happy New Year'' (Experience
Hendrix) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the cover shot of Hendrix decked out in Santa suit and
beard to the music within, this package smacks of dead-rock-star
cash-in. Included are just three tracks: a ``Little Drummer
Boy''/``Silent Night''/``Auld Lang Syne'' medley, Hendrix's own
``Three Little Bears'' and a bonus extended version of the first
track, all recorded in 1968-69. There's some predictably great
guitar work here, but the disc is ultimately for Hendrix
completists or unhinged Christmas collectors only. 2 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QR; 
 &QL; 
Various/``A Merry Affair: Starbucks Swinging Songs of Red Velvet
and Mistletoe Kisses'' (EMI/Capitol Special Markets) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's time to put the cool back in the yule. This compilation,
featuring Frank Sinatra, Diana Krall, Ella Fitzgerald, Holly Cole,
Dean Martin, Lou Rawls and Mel Torme (crooning ``The Christmas
Song'' the way he intended) is perfect for cocktail sipping and
even a little rug cutting. It's hard to sit still through Ella's
``Sleigh Ride'' and the Ray Brown Trio's rendition of ``Let It
Snow.'' If you want to get cozy, grab your honey and go for a whirl
under the mistletoe to Dino's ``I've Got Love to Keep Me Warm'' or
Nancy Wilson's ``What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?'' 3 1/2 stars

BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY SURVIVES THE SWING REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, Dec. 10 or later. Fact box at bottom) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The swing revival almost buried Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, when the cult movie classic ``Swingers''
kicked off a frenzy for all things swing, the Ventura-based
jump-jive band had already produced two homemade albums.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, when the swing backlash inevitably began, Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy (BBVD) was accused of bandwagon jumping, even though
the seven-piece outfit had been honing its craft since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the backlash was coming,'' recalls BBVD founder Scotty
Morris. ``Swing as a genre was getting bashed badly. We knew no
matter what we did _ whether our new album was going to be great or
just typical _ it would get pulverized. Only our true fans would
stick with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, singer-songwriter Morris and company did a credible
job of keeping the flame burning while moving the music forward on
``This Beautiful Life'' (Coolsville/Interscope), the follow-up to
BBVD's million-selling self-titled Grammy-nominated debut.
</P>
<P>
   On the new disc, BBVD adds Latin rhythms (``I Wanna Be Like
You),'' a lush ballad (``Sleep Tight'') and even a bluesy reading
of the rarity ``Ol' MacDonald'' as popularized by Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz is building again,'' Morris said. ``But we never felt
totally part of the whole new swing thing anyway. It was a little
hard to swallow. I mean, you never imagine yourself being thrown
into a position where your first (major label) record attracts so
much attention. Looking back, the entire experience was
bittersweet. We'd been on the road six years, and our big
breakthrough was actually our third album.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we hit the highest peaks. But when we got there, it was
chicks on stilts wearing zoot suits. When something is running out
of control like that, there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   BBVD appears Dec. 20 at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and
on New Year's Eve at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium's Fantasia 2000
event with the London Symphony Orchestra and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for the band that was to become BBVD was built by
Morris 10 years ago. Soon after discovering he and drummer Kurt
Sodergren shared similar musical tastes, both a friendship and a
band were formed. The two then recruited charismatic string bassist
Dirk Shumaker and baritone saxophonist Andy Rowley and immediately
began gigging along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the band evolved into the current seven-piece lineup,
which also features Glen ``The Kid'' Marhevka on trumpet, Karl
Hunter on tenor saxophone and Joshua Levy on piano.
</P>
<P>
   The band continued its relentless tour schedule, gradually
building what was to become a fiercely loyal fan base for its
swinging Cab Calloway/Louis Jordan sound. They launched a weekly
residency in Hollywood at the Derby, which was immortalized in Doug
Liman's hip ``Swingers.''
</P>
<P>
   The low-budget art-house favorite earned a huge buzz,
catapulting BBVD to national attention. The band appeared on the
popular ``Swingers'' soundtrack, which featured tunes from Dean
Martin, Tony Bennett and Bobby Darin along with three BBVD cuts.
</P>
<P>
   After completing their self-titled major label debut for
Coolsville, BBVD hit the road, eventually seeing that high-spirited
album take up residency in the Billboard chart for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the band play for President Clinton, they were the
first group ever to play both the Orange Bowl and Super Bowl
half-time telecasts after the release of just one major label
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bugs me is, now that we've finally reached a
night-after-night consistency, the press decides to be cruel,''
Morris said. ``And when it's time for the music awards, I wonder if
they're going to give the Grammy to Britney Spears' choreographer
or makeup person.''
</P>
<P>
   On the new ``Beautiful Life'' album, BBVD recorded ``I Wanna Be
Like You'' from the 1966 classic, ``The Jungle Book.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris says the tune has been part of the band's live show for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally thought it would make a cool B-side, but it came
out so well, it made its way onto the record front and center,'' he
said. ``It just makes you smile every time you hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new tune, ``Some Things,'' is a nod to the cool jazz
sound of Gerry Mulligan and Dexter Gordon in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very specific idea about this song,'' Morris says. ``I
imagined Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers on one bandstand, the
Count Basie Orchestra on the other and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in
between. I'm very fond of this track.''
</P>
<P>
   And the swinging Sinatra number closes the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the road when we lost Frank, and we were all very
shaken,'' Morris said. ``We felt this tribute would be our small
gesture of thanks for the lifetime of inspiration he provided
us.'' &QL;

DOTCOMGUY TO PURCHASE ALL NEEDS VIA WEB, WON'T LEAVE HOUSE FOR A
YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREA AHLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truly wired Web surfers have suggested that all they need to
survive is a high-speed Internet connection, a computer and a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   A 26-year-old Dallas native intends to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   Meet DotComGuy, who was known as Mitch Maddox before, he said,
he legally changed his name this fall. He will enter an empty house
in the Lake Highlands neighborhood of Dallas with only a donated
laptop computer and an Internet connection at noon Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In a marketing stunt that would make P.T. Barnum proud, he
intends to live exclusively off purchases made on the Internet for
a year. He says he will not leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist that recalls the films ``EdTV'' and ``The Truman
Show,'' the world will be able to watch DotComGuy's adventure 24
hours a day, seven days a week on www.dotcomguy.com via a streaming
video Web cast.
</P>
<P>
   The point for DotComGuy and his corporate sponsors is to
demonstrate the usefulness and reliability of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``DotComGuy can become a reference point for people before they
buy a product and where to go and purchase it,'' he said. ``We're
looking to provide a forum for people to talk about their Internet
experiences to share and learn from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   DotComGuy and his sponsors have established these ground rules
for his cyberspace journey:
</P>
<P>
   He has to buy everything he needs over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   He can leave the house and grounds only in the event of a
serious illness or death in his immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   He may go outside, but only to his back yard. (The yard is
large, with a creek running through it.)
</P>
<P>
   He can have visitors. In fact, he will probably have many
cyber-guests and celebrity visitors.
</P>
<P>
   DotComGuy said he had the idea for the project about a year ago.
But it didn't become a reality until a few months ago, when he
spoke with Len Critcher, a buddy from junior high school, about how
to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   The two formed DotComGuy Inc., with Critcher as president.
DotComGuy, a former computer systems manager, said he sold some
stock and cashed in his 401(k) plan to finance the venture.
</P>
<P>
   The two have also lined up sponsors who will provide funding or
goods. Most sponsors are involved in technology or electronic
commerce, and they hope that the publicity will translate into
online customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway is providing the computer. Other sponsors _ who call the
project ``clever,'' ``edgy,'' and ``pretty strange'' _ include
Net.B(at)k, Mall.com, radio station KDGE/94.5 FM and Peapod.com, a
grocery service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may attract a lot of consumers, based on the novelty of
it,'' said Amy Larson, senior loyalty marketing manager at
Peapod.com.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kerin, a Southern Methodist University marketing
professor, called the project an ``interesting publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   He said e-commerce companies that do not have an established
reputation need to overcome consumer uncertainty about security and
delivery. That's why many online companies are spending millions on
advertising in traditional media like radio, television and print
to get people to visit their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mall.com, which is based in Austin, jumped on board after an
impromptu meeting with the DotComGuy founders at the Mall.com 500
Indy-car race in Fort Worth in October.
</P>
<P>
   Critcher, who will produce the 24-hour Web cast, said the
project gave Mall.com a way to increase its exposure while
educating consumers on how to use its site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project may seem extreme, DotComGuy is not going
where no one has gone before. He's just doing it for a longer time.
In November, ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program put two
29-year-old New Yorkers in an ``e-cave'' for one week with a bed, a
refrigerator, a $500 daily stipend and a computer to access the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other news organizations, such as The Wall Street Journal, have
done similar Internet living experiences.
</P>
<P>
   While sitting in a house for a year may make some people
stir-crazy, DotComGuy will be well-paid. His first monthly paycheck
will be only $24. But the amount will double each month as an
incentive to stay. If he makes it through December, DotComGuy will
be paid a total of $98,280.
</P>
<P>
   DotComGuy said it was necessary to live in the house for a full
year to demonstrate the full extent of the Web, beyond just
shopping for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wired life is going to be a very hot issue for lots of
people in the future,'' said Gordon Stark, vice president of
marketing at Panja, a DotComGuy sponsor. ``These guys are probably
going to show in a short period of time exactly how this technology
is going to impact the way we live and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Panja, a Dallas electronics company, will let DotComGuy use its
Panja 1000 entertainment device that allows users to download
Internet music and video files directly to stereo systems or
television sets.
</P>
<P>
   DotComGuy will also be able to step into the Internet,
literally. As part of the programming, DotComGuy will occasionally
review Web sites by standing in front of a green screen through
which a Web site is displayed. It works much like a weather
forecast on television.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to host cyber-chats, keep DotComGuy's
personal journal online, and possibly set up a rating system for
sites that DotComGuy has used or demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   While DotComGuy will be incorporating the Internet into his
daily living, he said he probably will also buy high-tech items
that might not be in the typical family budget to demonstrate the
tech possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Critcher said DotComGuy is not limited to visiting sites from
sponsors, nor does he have a daily spending limit. But because the
founders have tapped their own resources for initial funding,
Critcher said, the budget is not unlimited.

FIRST LADIES TAKE THE CAKE, AND CHEESE RING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two recipes today from American first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The first is Lady Bird Johnson's lemon cake recipe. This cake
was baked for Luci's White House wedding and was much-publicized at
the time. Ann Strawser of Arlington, Texas, sent the recipe. She
used to make it for a friend who couldn't eat egg whites.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

egg yolks until light and lemon-colored; blend into creamed
mixture. Sift together flour, baking powder and salt; resift 3
times. Add sifted ingredients to creamed mixture in thirds,

</P>
<P>
   Add vanilla, lemon rind and lemon juice; beat 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in greased 10-inch bundt pan in preheated oven at 325
degrees for 1 hour or until cake tester inserted in center comes
out clean.
</P>

degrees for 25 minutes. Double the frosting recipe for a layer
cake.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon icing:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup butter or margarine, room temperature
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Emma Jean Ross of Euless, Texas, wrote looking for Rosalynn
Carter's recipe for a cheese ring. She checked all the Jell-O
recipes she could and came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rosalynn is a Southerner, it's reasonable to think the
recipe would include Jell-O. However, there's not a bit of gelatin
in this composed appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   ROSALYNN'S PLAINS CHEESE RING
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6-8
</P>
<P>
   1 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, finely grated
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped pecan
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   6 twists freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Dash of cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   12-ounce jar strawberry preserves
</P>
<P>
   Whole-grain crackers or melba toast
</P>
<P>
   Combine cheese with mayonnaise, chopped nuts and onions. Mix in
black pepper and cayenne, and blend thoroughly. Press into 3-cup
ring mold. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, dip mold into a pan of hot water for 15-20 seconds
before turning out onto a serving platter. Fill center with
strawberry preserves and serve at once with whole-grain crackers or
melba toast.

preserves: 639 calories, 50 grams fat, 35 grams carbohydrates, 16

   Julie Carson saw a sweet-potato pudding recipe being
demonstrated on a TV show. It included sweet potatoes, sugar,
butter, milk and eggs, but she's not sure which spices were
included. Does anyone have such a recipe?
</P>
<P>
   A reader is looking for the recipe for fruited rice pudding
(which includes pineapple preserves and currants). The recipe was
included in the Southern Living annual recipe collection for 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Juanice Walther has misplaced a recipe that used frozen bread
rolls and pudding to make a coffeecake.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Jones of Cleburne, Texas, recalls the chile con queso
served at the Jiminez restaurant when it was on Grand Avenue in
north Fort Worth during the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was before queso really became a hot seller everywhere,
and theirs was very different. We were told that it was made with
five different cheeses, and it was almost completely white with
just a very slight tint of yellow. As the yellow queso became more
popular, theirs became very yellow as well. It was not nearly as
tasty as the original.''
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone have a clue about this one?

   Here's a rundown of the artificial sweeteners on the market.
</P>
<P>
   SACCHARIN
</P>
<P>
   Commercial names: Sweet 'N Low, Sugar Twin
</P>
<P>
   Properties: 300 times sweeter than sugar; long shelf life,
heat-stable. Slightly bitter aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Safety: On a government list of likely carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ASPARTAME
</P>
<P>
   Commercial names: NutraSweet, Equal, NatraTaste
</P>
<P>
   Properties: 200 times sweeter than sugar. Unstable when heated,
so if used in cooking, should be added at the very end or heated
for only very brief periods. Tastes similar to sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Safety: People who have phenylketonuria, a rare genetic
disorder, should not use; their bodies cannot process an amino acid
found in aspartame.
</P>
<P>
   Other people have complained of headaches and allergic
reactions, but no side effects have been scientifically documented.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ACESULFAME K
</P>
<P>
   Commercial name: Sunett
</P>
<P>
   Properties: 200 times sweeter than sugar. Stable when heated,
long shelf life. Often used in conjunction with other artificial
sweeteners to stabilize them in baking and to help retain sweetness
over time. No aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Safety: Some critics say tests to determine safety were sloppily
conducted, and that it's impossible to tell whether the substance
can cause cancer or not. Supporters note that more than 90 studies
have shown it to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   SUCRALOSE
</P>
<P>
   Commercial name: Splenda
</P>
<P>
   Properties: 600 times sweeter than sugar. Stable when heated.
Tastes very much like sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Safety: 100 studies conducted over 20 years found no risk to
humans.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Note: Sugar substitutes also come in granulated form, usually
measured the same as sugar in a recipe. These include Splenda
granular, Equal Spoonful, Sugar Twin Spoonable and Sugar Twin
Brown.

SUGAR-FREE SALVATION FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T EAT SUGAR-LADEN HOLIDAY
TREATS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Visions of sugarplums are dancing in everybody's heads this time
of year.
</P>
<P>
   For diabetics, though, the debate over whether to indulge has
more serious consequences than for most folks. The consumption of
too many carbohydrates (of which sugar is one type) raises blood
sugar, possibly resulting in long-range complications such as
blindness and kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, though, sugar is no longer completely forbidden.
Instead, experts tell diabetics that it's acceptable to work some
sugar into their meal plans. So sweetmeats (as well as other
holiday favorites such as stuffing and sweet potatoes) can be
carefully incorporated into a diabetic diet.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``They go into deprivation; at the holidays, they
would overdo it,'' says Diane Wallace, a registered dietitian and
certified diabetes educator with Huguley Health System of North
Texas. A bit of sugar now and then helps keep the sweet tooth under
control.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to eat dessert, ``cut back on potatoes, sweet
potatoes, stuffing _ eat smaller portions of those,'' Wallace
advises.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics should follow dietary guidelines established for them
individually by a dietitian. In addition to sugar, fat intake
should be considered, as diabetics are at greater risk for heart
disease than the general population, and some are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace suggests that diabetics pace themselves during the
holidays: ``Try not to save up and eat a large meal at the end of
the day. Snack a little so you're not tempted to overeat. And
exercise (performed on the day of a festive meal, such as
Christmas) can help bring down that blood sugar after eating a
little bit more than they were supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipes provided here focus on sugar substitutes. If you're
converting some other recipe (one that calls for sugar), Wallace
warns that you shouldn't substitute a sugar alternative for more
than half the sugar in the recipe. ``The volume is so much less
when you're using a sugar substitute that the end product will come
out different,'' she says. (See list of sugar substitutes and their
uses.)

<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, beat 5 egg whites until stiff. Add 1/4
cup fructose; beat well. Sift together remaining 1/4 cup fructose,
flour, baking powder and salt.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks and almond extract until very
light and thick. Fold egg yolks into beaten egg whites. Gently fold
in dry ingredients a little at a time. Spread batter evenly in
prepared pan. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until cake springs back
when touched lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Sift confectioners' sugar over a clean kitchen towel. Loosen
edges of cake; turn out onto towel. Remove wax paper carefully.

   Meringue mushrooms: Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Grease and
flour a cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   In a small mixing bowl, beat 1 egg white and cream of tartar
until foamy. Gradually beat in sugar until it forms stiff, glossy
peaks. Spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip. Don't
fill bag too full. Holding pastry bag fairly close to cookie sheet,
press out 3/4-inch-wide mushroom caps. Smooth top if peaked. For
stems, hold bag vertically; press out meringue. Pull straight up
until short stem forms. Continue to make mushroom stems. (Or, using
2 small spoons, form rounded mushroom caps and straight short
stems, smoothing out rough edges with the back of a spoon.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until dry and ivory-colored. Loosen
with spatula. Cool on a wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble, make a small hole in underside of caps. Put in some
of the reserved cream. Insert pointed stem end.

DOUGLAS CUTS FINE FIGURE IN `DIAMONDS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, Dec. 10 or later. Fact box at bottom.) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is fitting that Miramax Films chose a movie set in Reno,
Nev., to gamble on Kirk Douglas' return to the screen in a lead
role less than four years after he suffered a speech-impairing
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds'' pays off on the wager. Douglas, still vigorous at
83, carries the film with one of the best performances of his long
career, probably because many of his scenes are straight from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas plays Harry Agensky, a former prize-winning boxer known
as the Polish Prince now dealing with old age, the aftermath of a
stroke and the death of his beloved wife. His son Lance (Dan
Aykroyd) and grandson Michael (Corbin Allred) arrive at his home in
western Canada with intentions of taking the old man to Banff. But
Harry brings up his oft-told tale of some diamonds he earned from a
Reno crime boss decades ago when he agreed to throw a fight, so
Harry, Lance and Michael impulsively head to the gaming mecca in
search of the hidden gems.
</P>
<P>
   It's a road trip all right, but not a standard buddy movie
because of the emotional baggage all three are dragging along on
this vacation. Harry mourns the losses of his wife, youth and
health; Lance still struggles with having felt neglected and
unloved by his father; and 15-year-old Michael is on the brink of
giving up allegiance to his own father in favor of his new stepdad.
</P>
<P>
   The whole father-son dynamic is a key element in ``Diamonds,''
and unfortunately it is the most trite aspect of Allan Aaron Katz's
script. The ``why can't you say you love me'' idea has been done
before (``East of Eden'' comes to mind), as has the concept of the
teen-age son rebelliously pushing his father's buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's old-age issues, so often given to supporting players,
are well-developed here, in part because Douglas understands
first-hand the depression and frustrations common to stroke
sufferers. Harry is still full of bluster and ready go a few rounds
with all takers, but can break down and sob over his inadequacies.
Douglas also shows a knack for comedy and is not afraid to be the
butt of the humor.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' nicest moments come in a scene with his longtime friend
Lauren Bacall, who plays Sin-dee, the senior citizen's answer to
the whore with a heart of gold, or, in this case, madam.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' own stroke gives his performance an added credibility
as each word of dialogue is a deliberate effort. (By the way,
Douglas' lines are easily understood throughout the film.)
</P>
<P>
   Allred (also seen in ``Anywhere but Here'') is a natural as
Michael, fitting well with both Aykroyd and Douglas, even though
Aykroyd and Douglas don't always mesh with each other. He has funny
moments at Sin-Dee's brothel when he prepares to give up his
virginity to a prostitute named Sugar (Jenny McCarthy).
</P>
<P>
   Director John Asher, son of TV director William Asher, does a
straightforward job in his third feature. He makes good use of
Douglas' old footage from ``Champion,'' incorporating those
Republic Pictures boxing scenes into Harry's flashbacks to his
glory days. &QL;

Gail Sheehy dissects Hillary's psyche 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hillary's Choice''
</P>
<P>
   By Gail Sheehy
</P>
<P>
   Biography
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $23.95
</P>
<P>
   We can state, by now, that Bill and Hillary Clinton have
succeeded O.J. Simpson as America's emotional lightning rods.
People love them; love him/hate her; love her/hate him; or hate
them both. But many Americans judge others by whether they're in
what might be termed ``Clinton agreement''; they've learned all
they want to know about the first couple and dismiss any new
information or insights as extraneous.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that's why Gail Sheehy's ``Hillary's Choice'' will
generate a little post-publication stir and then disappear. The
book itself, a study ofthe first lady by one of our best-known
sociologist/biographers, can objectively be called uneven. Sheehy
is a superb reporter, and even though many of her interviews
involve the often-quoted (Dick Morris again!), she elicits new,
fascinating testimony, especially from Hillary Clinton's brother
and mother.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, though, Sheehy succumbs to temptation and launches
into cliche-ridden pop psychology, telling readers what ``all this
means'' when they ought to be making up their own minds. Having
spent so many words proving that Hillary is uncategorizable, Sheehy
tries the categorizing game herself and, by so doing, puts the
brakes on her book's undeniable momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cause is the author's own, very obvious, inability
to decide whether she likes the first lady. We learn in the
earliest chapters that young Hillary grew up in a household just as
tormented, in its way, as the much-publicized emotion-racked
childhood home of future husband Bill. Deprived of paternal
affection _ Hugh Rodham Sr. withheld approval regarding anything
his daughter did _ Hillary went off to Wellesley College uncertain
of who she wanted to be, and tried on several personas before
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   What never changed, though, was the young woman's iron will
power when she did decide to support or work for a cause.
Gradually, her personal politics switched from Goldwater
Republicanism to Martin Luther King liberalism (as a teen-ager, she
met King briefly). The teen-ager who wore thick glasses and
body-swathing dresses evolved into a student leader whose strident
commencement address won a standing ovation from her peers. She
embarked on a torrid love affair (Sheehy perhaps provides too many
details here), set herself on the road to lucrative private law
practice, and gave everything up to marry an overweight womanizer
from the Arkansas backwoods.
</P>
<P>
   This throwing away of potential, this self-denial to further the
career of someone else, is the basis of Sheehy's title. And, as
events as well as this book make clear, that first choice of
Hillary's led to similarly difficult choices later on.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mrs. Clinton, Sheehy proves again and again, hated
Arkansas. She hated sublimating her emerging, forceful personality
to the sweet stereotype expected by Arkansas voters who otherwise
might not vote for Bill Clinton _ heaven save the Sooey State from
a feminist first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill's philandering bruised his marriage but didn't destroy
it _ the Clintons had a beloved daughter to nurture and political
ambition to protect. Sheehy dramatically shows how Hillary
Clinton's nature lent itself to attacking her husband's political
and personal accusers instead of deciding, after a while, that the
man she married had wasted enough second chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's Choice'' also recounts White House Hillary,
including the humiliation she suffered by her failure to effect
health-care reform. The Sheehy pop prognosis is that Hillary is
addicted to saving her husband, since she learned in childhood to
measure self-worth by rescuing others.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheehy is ambivalent about Hillary Clinton, her subject is
frankly displeased with the author. Her staff members have begun
denouncing portions of ``Hillary's Choice'' as inaccurate _ a case
in point is whether Hugh Rodham attended his daughter's Wellesley
graduation. Sheehy writes that he didn't; Hillary Clinton's
spokespeople insist that he did, and Rodham is dead, so no one can
ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's Choice,'' read by anyone who hasn't made up his or
her mind about its subject, would be about a B-plus effort. It
won't replace ``Passages'' as the book for which Sheehy is
eventually remembered, but it's far from hack work. Unfortunately,
there are very few objective readers left. .MDUL/.MDNM/ (Visit the

 (For release Sunday, Dec. 12)  
 McGOVERN NOW UNDERSTANDS JOHNSON'S VIETNAM AGONY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this holiday season of surprises, it is
astounding to learn that Democrat George McGovern, a stern critic
of Lyndon B. Johnson, now judges him to have been one of the three
or four greatest presidents since Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there, on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times last Sunday,
was McGovern's confession, nearly three decades after the fact,
that he understands the ordeal Johnson suffered as result of the
war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views on the war have not changed,'' wrote the one-time
South Dakota senator who ran for president in 1972 as an outspoken
critic of the war, ``but my opinion of Johnson has. I believe now
that with the exceptions of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt _
and perhaps Theodore Roosevelt _ Lyndon Johnson was the greatest
president since Abraham Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern's change of attitude is not a matter of the dove
suddenly discovering that the hawk was correct. It is rather one of
the dove belatedly realizing that the hawk suffered deep agony as
he dispatched young men and women to the bloody cauldron of
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern revised his thinking after reading that former
ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith had called for a reassessment of
Johnson and after studying presidential transcripts. The
transcripts covered Johnson's taped White House conversations with
Georgia's Richard Russell, chairman of the Senate Armed Service
Committee during Vietnam, and McGeorge Bundy, who served as
Johnson's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that Johnson, then Senate majority leader, and Russell
both opposed American intervention in Vietnam when the Eisenhower
administration proposed it in the 1950s, McGovern explained that
the tapes demonstrate how Johnson and Russell ``continued to have
terrible doubts and regrets, even while publicly supporting the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us who knew Johnson and covered his presidency were
aware long ago of Johnson's despair as the war went on and on,
claiming thousands of lives. He would leave his bed in the middle
of the night and go to the White House Situation Room, where he
could learn how many of the troops he sent into battle had been
shot from the skies or killed on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson succeeded the slain John F. Kennedy as president in
November 1963, America had 16,000 military advisers in Vietnam.
Thinking that the United States could defeat the communist Vietcong
and preserve South Vietnam as a bastion of democracy, Johnson
dispatched the first contingent of U.S. Marines to Southeast Asia
in 1965. He continued to escalate America's participation in the
war until in 1968 more than a half million U.S. troops were there.
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere of the Cold War, he felt, as almost any U.S.
president would have felt, that America had to make a strong stand
against communist aggression in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, anger over the war cut a bitter, bloody swath
through this country. College campuses and downtown streets erupted
into battlegrounds where antiwar militants and police fought each
other in excruciating confrontations. The cost in terms of American
unity was horrendous.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most forceful figures to occupy the presidency,
Johnson also was one of the most insecure and most volatile. He
could be as warm and gentle as a fur-lined glove and as devious and
demanding as a raging bull.
</P>
<P>
   When he entered the presidency he hoped to emulate his idol,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who guided the United States successfully
through the Great Depression and World War II. Johnson, with his
``Great Society'' program, was determined to enact a remarkable
package of domestic reforms and then prevent America's Cold War
adversaries from expanding their domain.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved the first objective with the passage of Medicare and
Medicaid, with a massive infusion of federal money into education,
and with monumental civil rights laws that ended legalized racial
segregation in public accommodations and polling booths. But he
failed the second test when victory in Vietnam became unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   He finally decided in 1968 to forego another full term in the
White House because he could not heal the breech that separated
American from American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his involvement with the war,'' McGovern wrote,
``Johnson used his remarkable political skills to build the most
far-reaching progressive domestic program since the New Deal. ...
Johnson did more than any other president to advance civil rights,
education and housing, to name just three of his concerns, through
enactment of laws.''
</P>
<P>
   And when his presidency ended, he left behind the last balanced
budget that Americans would see until the final two years of Bill
Clinton's tenure.

 &HT;    AS GOP NOMINEE, BUSH WOULD ACCEPT PUBLIC FUNDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas will accept public
funds for his general election campaign if he wins the Republican
nomination, his top political aide said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising prowess has allowed him to forgo federal
funding and avoid any spending restraints during the primary
campaign season. Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes are
the only presidential candidates in both major parties who need not
abide by state-by-state spending curbs.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long breakfast meeting with reporters, Karl Rove, who
has drawn the strategic road map for the front-running Texas
Republican, noted that ``it is awfully difficult to raise $60
million or thereabouts between the convention and the Election Day
and still campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove dismissed any suggestion that it would be hypocritical of
Bush to defeat his Republican rivals for the nomination by spending
freely in the primaries, only to turn around and use taxpayer
money, without any outside help, for the final White House contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the logic of that at all,'' Rove said. ``The
people who have been critical of what we've done so far generally
favor the public financing route that we'll be taking if we win the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove also sought to deflect the idea, which has been widely
reported, that in two recent debates, in New Hampshire and Arizona,
Bush came across as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the burden of a front-runner,'' he said,
predicting that ``the race will now tighten because we face
candidates who are about to split their time (among early primary
battlegrounds). Everybody has to get past you to get into the first
place. That's just the facts of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove noted that Bush has actually doubled his debate experience
in his two recent outings. His two prior engagements were in Texas
gubernatorial races, against Ann Richards in 1994 and Gary Mauro in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that Bush appeared somewhat stiff before the TV
cameras and may have been misconstrued as having smirked at his
primary opponents, Rove nevertheless said: ``People will make their
judgments about the whole person. Does he come across better when
he's sitting two feet away from you? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rove sees it, the political chemistry of the 2000 race from
the White House differs radically from recent such contests. This
means, he said, that there can be ``a great desire for change in
the country and a movement to deny a 'third term' to (Vice
President Al) Gore even though the nation appears to be
prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Austin,'' Rove, 48, noted, ``and there I a meet a
lot of high-tech people like those who work for Dell (Computer
Corp.) and who are generally left of center in their political
beliefs. And they say that they're responsible for the good
economy, and not the Clinton-Gore administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rove said, President Clinton's final year in office will
be consumed with ``protecting his legacy and electing a
successor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very strong emphasis in this White House on how to
shape issues to be of the greatest possible assistance to Al Gore.
That's just the reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his extended exchange with Washington-based political
journalists from major news outlets, Rove suggested that their
ability to influence voters may well dim ``with the rise of the new
media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my travels, more and more I hear from people who say
they've watched an entire Bush speech on C-SPAN,'' Rove reported.
In addition to the cable-sponsored public affairs channel, Rove
said, there appears to be a desire among voters in this election
cycle ``to bypass traditional media sources in learning about
candidates on the Internet.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the music world long ago shifted to the digital
audio compact disc, people of a certain groovy generation _ you
know who you are _ still find it hard to part with their large
collections of long-playing vinyl phonograph records.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, interest in the almost forgotten LPs is rekindled
when curious children of the digital age, having passed through
several unfortunate music stages that may have included Hanson, Rap
and Heavy Metal, discover that there is interesting music in the
sleeves of their parents' dusty old Elvis, Thelonious Monk or Otis
Redding albums.
</P>
<P>
   One alternative to fighting the kids over the fragile old
records, or being held slave to heavy crates of vinyl year after
year, has been to buy new CDs of old albums as they are re-released
in digital format. It was a happy day for me recently when the
long-lost ``Roll Over'' album by the New York Rock &AMP; Roll Ensemble
finally showed up on disc.
</P>
<P>
   But some treasured recordings in my collection, like Tony
Trischka's early ``Bluegrass'' album, are either not available on
CD or are very difficult to find. Other albums may contain only a
song or two worth preserving, and buying a new CD version just for
those tracks may not seem worth the expense.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the proliferation of relatively affordable systems for
recording your own CDs, some album owners may want to take their
LPs for a last spin, and start creating their own CDs. There are a
number of reasons to do so.
</P>
<P>
   CDs are more durable and do not degrade with each playing, as
LPs do. Also, people today want to listen to their music on the
move, and turntables are rarely seen outside the living room or
den. There are more than 500 million CD players in the world
capable of playing home-recorded CDs, not just in stereo systems
but also in personal computers, automobile dashboards and other
portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring an LP to CD can be time-consuming, and it also
risks re-exposure to all those amazingly self-important liner notes
from the '60s and '70s. Sad to say, the music may not seem quite so
mesmerizing as it did 30 years ago, and you'll wonder why you toted
it from apartment to apartment and house to house. But for music
aficionados and casual listeners alike, creating new digital discs
from old analogue ones can have practical as well as nostalgic
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to go, each with its benefits and drawbacks.
The first and easier method requires a CD recorder that attaches to
a stereo system and is designed expressly for copying and playing
audio CDs. The second demands a relatively brawny personal computer
equipped with a sound card, special software, and a CD-R or CD-RW
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The PC method can be a lot more complicated but, done properly,
yields more satisfying results. And if you use a computer-based CD
recorder there are a number of other tasks it can do, including
backing up a hard drive, storing digital photographs and video
clips, and storing MP3 audio files downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While this discussion focuses on transferring analog LPs to
digital CDs, the same processes apply to other analog media
including 45s, 78s, audio cassettes, 8-tracks, reel tapes, radio
broadcasts and even live recordings done with a microphone. Those
willing to become proficient with sound-editing software can even
expect to create CDs that sound better than the album, by reducing
(but not completely eliminating) the hisses, snaps, crackles and
pops.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting to specifics, a note about copyright. The laws
are complex, but in practice people make cassettes for personal use
all the time and making a CD is no different. It is illegal, and
unfair to the artist, to make copies to sell or to distribute free
to friends.
</P>
<P>
   For now, consumers seem to be on the honor system. As the record
and consumer electronic companies wise up to the digital age, which
they are doing very quickly, copyright controls will undoubtedly be
integrated into the CD recording technology to restrict the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A Philips CD recorder I tested came with this warning label:
``Unless you own the copyright or have permission to copy from the
copyright owner, you may be violating copyright law and be subject
to payment of damages and other remedies. If you are uncertain
about your rights you should contact your legal adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical issues are equally dense. Let's start with the
relatively easy one: The stereo-based (non-PC) solution.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies make consumer audio (i.e. stereo-based) CD
recorders, including Panasonic, Pioneer, Marantz, Sony, Onkyo,
Yamaha and Philips, with prices ranging from a few hundred dollars
to more than $1,500. I've been testing a Philips CDR-765 dual deck
audio CD player and recorder (list price $599.95). It can be used
to make exact copies of audio CDs, but it can also be used with
other stereo components to transfer LPs and cassettes to a CD.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips CDR-765 is in the same style as traditional stereo
components, so it attaches easily _ well, relatively easily _ to a
component stereo system. Some older or lower-end receivers may not
have sufficient connection ports needed to allow the CD recorder to
be attached without detaching some other component.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Philips technical support telephone service was
not helpful, but after fiddling with a variety of connections I
finally was able to get the analog (LP) signal to register with the
recorder. Then it is simply a matter of loading the blank CD and
pressing the ``record'' button.
</P>
<P>
   Just as if you were recording a cassette tape, you can mix
tracks from different albums, or from other CDs, cassette tapes and
MP3 files. The only thing that makes the process more complex than
recording a cassette tape is that the CD disc has to be
``finished'' after the last track is recorded, or else it cannot
play in other CD players. The finishing process typically is
automated and takes a couple of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks. In this method, every sound made by the
turntable, including pops and clicks, was recorded onto the blank
CD-R disc (see sidebar for an explanation of CD-R versus CD-RW).
The result was a CD that sounded just like an LP.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the PC method, which requires a little more
investment of time and money, but which yields superior results.
The necessary components include a personal computer with enough
hard disk space to hold space-hogging WAV audio files at least
temporarily, a CD-R or CD-RW recorder, a good sound card, and
special software for editing, organizing and ``burning'' the sound
files onto the blank CD disc.

Bush to defeat his Republican rivals for the nomination by spending
freely in the primaries, only to turn around and use taxpayer
money, without any outside help, for the final White House contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the logic of that at all,'' Rove said. ``The
people who have been critical of what we've done so far generally
favor the public financing route that we'll be taking if we win the
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove also sought to deflect the idea, which has been widely
reported, that in two recent debates, in New Hampshire and Arizona,
Bush came across as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the burden of a front-runner,'' he said,
predicting that ``the race will now tighten because we face
candidates who are about to split their time (among early primary
battlegrounds). Everybody has to get past you to get into the first
place. That's just the facts of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove noted that Bush has actually doubled his debate experience
in his two recent outings. His two prior engagements were in Texas
gubernatorial races, against Ann Richards in 1994 and Gary Mauro in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that Bush appeared somewhat stiff before the TV
cameras and may have been misconstrued as having smirked at his
primary opponents, Rove nevertheless said: ``People will make their
judgments about the whole person. Does he come across better when
he's sitting two feet away from you? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rove sees it, the political chemistry of the 2000 race from
the White House differs radically from recent such contests. This
means, he said, that there can be ``a great desire for change in
the country and a movement to deny a 'third term' to (Vice
President Al) Gore even though the nation appears to be
prosperous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in Austin,'' Rove, 48, noted, ``and there I a meet a
lot of high-tech people like those who work for Dell (Computer
Corp.) and who are generally left of center in their political
beliefs. And they say that they're responsible for the good
economy, and not the Clinton-Gore administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rove said, President Clinton's final year in office will
be consumed with ``protecting his legacy and electing a
successor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very strong emphasis in this White House on how to
shape issues to be of the greatest possible assistance to Al Gore.
That's just the reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his extended exchange with Washington-based political
journalists from major news outlets, Rove suggested that their
ability to influence voters may well dim ``with the rise of the new
media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my travels, more and more I hear from people who say
they've watched an entire Bush speech on C-SPAN,'' Rove reported.
In addition to the cable-sponsored public affairs channel, Rove
said, there appears to be a desire among voters in this election
cycle ``to bypass traditional media sources in learning about
candidates on the Internet.''

 UNDATED: CD disc.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The key is the computer's sound card, which must have a stereo
input jack. In general, a turntable cannot be connected directly to
the sound card. The signal must be amplified, either through a
stereo receiver (the most common way) or through a simple pre-amp,
which can be found at Radio Shack or some other electronics source
for $30 to $75. The receiver or amplifier then plugs into the sound
card's stereo line input jack.
</P>
<P>
   Most newer PCs have adequate sound cards, but a better sound
card yields better results. My Dell PC uses a Turtle Beach Montego
II sound card, and the results were decent. Audiophiles often
invest in top-of-the-line sound cards costing hundreds of dollars,
and then spend hundreds of dollars more for sophisticated audio
editing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, it appears that almost any brand-name CD-R or CD-RW
drive can do a good job in capturing LP tracks. Some drives are
faster than others, with recording speeds listed as 2X, 4X and so
on. The faster the drive, the more quickly it can copy digital
files. But they all slow down to no more than 1X when copying and
converting tracks directly from a slow LP to CD.
</P>
<P>
   Most CD-R and CD-RW drives come with the basic software needed
to copy digital CDs, but making CDs from an analog source like an
LP usually benefits from a more complete program. One of the most
popular is Adaptec's Easy CD Creator Deluxe version 4.0 for Windows
($99). Its counterpart for the Macintosh is called Toast. Other
audio editing programs include Sound Laundry, CoolEdit Pro,
GoldWave, Sound Forge and DCart.
</P>
<P>
   Because the CD recording field is so new, it is all too common
to have conflicts between one company's software and another's CD
recorder hardware. It took many hours, and a reluctant trip into
Windows system files, to resolve a system-crashing conflict between
Easy CD Creator and my Sony Spressa CD-RW drive. It is probably
wise to make sure the software is compatible with your CD recorder
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was worth it. The Adaptec software includes a
variety of utilities, including one called Spin Doctor, which
automates the process of removing pops, ticks and hisses from LPs.
Another utility automatically breaks an album side into separate
tracks, which in theory makes it easier to edit and arrange the
order of songs.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was more time-consuming, I found it more reliable to
record each album track separately. The utility isolates tracks by
listening for the silence between songs, but on my scratchy old Tom
Waits albums, for example, it was foiled by the static and noise
between tracks and either recorded the album side as one huge file
or broke single songs into multiple tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Like other CD-recording programs, Easy CD Creator lets the user
record the album tracks either directly to CD or (the method I
recommend) to the computer's hard disk. In this approach, a large
hard disk with gigabytes of free space is keenly appreciated. Each
minute of recorded music at CD quality eats more than 10 MB of disk
space.
</P>
<P>
   Recording first to the hard disk, as WAV files, has many
advantages. Chief among them is that the tracks can be edited, with
special effects like fade-ins and fade-outs, pitch changes, and the
tidying up of pops and clicks. (One Adaptec utility even let the
user add pops and ticks, to make digital CD tracks sound more like
old LPs. That was one special effect I definitely did not need.)
</P>
<P>
   Once the tracks are recorded and stored on the hard disk, they
can be used over and over again, edited in a variety of ways, sent
as e-mail attachments, converted into MP3 files for transfer to a
portable MP3 player, mixed with tracks from other sources to create
``greatest hits'' play lists or dance tracks, and, of course,
burned onto CDs.
</P>
<P>
   A side benefit is that clips can be edited from favorite album
or CD songs and used to replace the standard Windows WAV file
sounds. For example, snippets of James Brown or Kid Creole and the
Coconuts make more interesting sound effects than the usual Windows
system sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-inch record album was a showcase for clever art and liner
notes, and a 5-inch CD jewel case is not friendly to art or text.
However, Easy CD Creator includes handy templates for printing
colorful CD labels and covers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I'll transfer my entire LP collection onto CDs, and
with any luck I'll finish before compact discs are replaced by
something new and even better, like DVD Audio or holographic
crystals. Even then, I'll probably continue to haul the old albums
around, because I still can't bear to part with them. &QL;

 THE ABCs OF CDs: READ-ONLY, RECORDABLE AND REWRITABLE  
 (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A CD-ROM is read-only, which means the data are stamped
permanently into the disc, and additional data cannot be written
onto it.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R discs (the R stands for recordable) have a dye-based
recording layer that allows them to record information like data
files, digital photographs, video or audio.
</P>
<P>
   A low-power laser beam alters the dye in the recording layer.
CD-R discs are sometimes known as write-once discs because the
encoded data cannot be erased or overwritten. CD-R audio discs can
be played back on almost any CD player.
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW (for rewritable) discs can be erased and rerecorded
hundreds of times without a loss of quality. They use slightly more
powerful lasers that heat a silvery recording layer of silver,
antimony, indium and tellurium, altering its reflectivity.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks are erased, or more accurately, annealed, by
reheating the layer with the laser, in effect transforming the
silvery alloy back to its original crystalline state. Erasing is
possible only on the most recently recorded track or on the entire
disc.
</P>
<P>
   An important note: Because of their much-lower reflectivity,
CD-RW discs can be played back only on CD-RW drives. In other
words, if you want to record an album to play in the car or to give
to a friend, use a CD-R disc.
</P>
<P>
   A CD-RW drive is recommended because it can create both CD-R and
CD-RW discs, depending on the type of blank disc that is used for
recording. A CD-R drive can create only CD-R discs.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the recorders work only with special blank CD-R or
CD-RW discs found at electronics and computer stores. CD-RW discs
are slightly more expensive than CD-R discs, which cost about $2
each, although in bulk the discs can be as little as $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, you can't record onto old, unwanted commercial CDs, which
are permanently molded and stamped instead of burned. You're stuck
with that collection of Rippingtons CDs you got last Christmas. &QL;

SQUEEZING AN ALBUM COVER TO FIT IN A JEWEL CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it just doesn't seem like a Beatles recording without the
green apple somewhere on the packaging, CD labeling kits will
squeeze a vinyl album cover into a reproduction the size of a CD
jewel case.
</P>
<P>
   Such kits, including MicroVision Development's SureThing CD
Labeler (www.surething.com, $40), Stomp's CD Stomper Pro CD/DVD
Labeling System (www.cdstomper.com, $40) and Neato's CD Labeler Kit
(www.neato.com, $30), contain software that will import images into
square jewel-case-size templates, as well as circular templates for
labels that go directly on the discs.
</P>
<P>
   And for a start-your-own-record-label trick, many of these
programs have a software feature that lets you wrap text around a
circular disc label.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is relatively easy to design jewel case liners and
disc labels using the clip art software provided in the label kits,
reproducing the art from an old album cover is trickier. Most
scanners are too narrow to accommodate an entire album cover, which
measures almost one square foot.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to scan in the top half of the cover, then the
bottom half, and stitch the two together in an image editing
program like Adobe Photoshop. The Surething CD Labeler will join an
album cover's two halves directly within its template, said Paul
Cary, a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   If joining two halves seems too complicated, the only other
alternative when using a scanner is to center the album as much as
possible onto the scanner bed and do without the leftover edges.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to take a snapshot of the album cover front
and back with a digital camera, then enlarge or crop the images to
fit into a jewel case template. The fine print is likely to be
blurred, however, even if the image is taken at the highest
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the label kits comes with a supply of paper for printing
the booklet found in a jewel case's front, the disc label and the
tray liner and spine. Applicator devices are included for
positioning labels precisely onto the disc.
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible to create CD labels and jewel case liners
using popular desktop publishing software like Corel Print House or
Broderbund Print Shop Deluxe. Some of these programs contain
circular and square label templates that can receive imports of
graphics and text.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, Americal and Memorex are a few companies that sell packs
of printer-ready jewel case and CD labels that can be used with
these programs. If you work with 8{-by-11-inch paper instead of the
label paper, you will have to cut out the shapes after it comes out
of the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Some music enthusiasts find jewel cases cumbersome and prefer to
focus on the design of the disc label. They then store the CDs in
plastic sleeve-type cases. Mirage Inkjet Technologies
(www.mirageinkjet.com) and Kyso (www.kyso.com) produce glossy photo
label paper, and Kyso sells label paper flecked with iridescent
sparkles.

   Q. How can I convert the icons on my computer desktop to ones I
want instead of the regular Windows 98 ones?
</P>
<P>
   A. Spicing up your computing day with desktop icons other than
the standard issue (like My Computer) is fairly easy. Once you have
the icon or icons you would like to use, go to the Start menu to
Settings, pick Control Panel and select Display.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Effects tab in the box and then the Desktop Icons
option, which will show you all the default desktop icons. Click on
the icon you want to change, then click on the Change Icon button.
To select the replacement icon, click the Browse button, locate the
new icon file on your computer and click Open. You will see the
icon change, and if you like it, click on OK and close the box.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Macintosh user, click once on the icon you wish to
use and press Command-I. This brings up the Get Info box. Click
once on the icon's picture. A small box outline will form around
the icon. Press Command-C to copy it. Close that Get Info box,
click once on the icon you wish to change and press Command-I
again. Click on the old icon, and when the box outline appears,
type Command-V to paste the new icon into place before closing the
Get Info box.
</P>
<P>
   To find new icons, try Icons Plus (www.iconsplus.com), a
freeware site that offers many icons with a pop-culture bent for
both Mac and Windows. The site also has a lengthy list of links to
other icon outlets.
</P>

   No matter how careful people are, they are bound to scratch
furniture. Most of these mishaps are minor and can easily be be
erased or hidden before they become eyesores. However, no matter
how minor the blemish, you may not want to remove it yourself if
your furniture is a valuable antique.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture picks up dirt and dust that slowly works its way into
the waxed surface. Over time, this grime will dull the sheen of any
finish and obscure the beauty of the wood grain. Wood surfaces can
easily be cleaned with solvent, but be careful because some
solvents can remove or damage the finish. Alcohol, for example, can
dissolve a shellac finish. Mineral spirits work well and are
harmless to all finishes; still, it's a good practice to test any
solvent in an inconspicuous spot before working on a prominent
area.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that all solvents are flammable and toxic.
Read the directions carefully and take all precautions to prevent
fire and personal injury. Work in a ventilated area, and do not use
any solvent near an open flame. If you are going to do a lot of
work with a solvent, wear a respirator and rubber gloves.
</P>
<P>
   To clean furniture of wax and dirt build-up, wet a coarse, clean
rag with mineral spirits and wipe across the surface. Turn the rag
over to expose a clean side and wipe again. Continue this procedure
until the rag no longer picks up dirt.
</P>
<P>
   This technique works well with the large open surfaces, but it
may not remove the dirt that collects in the grooves and crevices
of carved areas. Clean these places with a cotton swab dipped in
mineral spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Scratches that are in the finish but do not cut into the wood
below can be removed with very fine steel wool (0000) and Danish
oil. Pour some oil into a pad of steel wool and rub with the grain.
Keep the pad saturated with oil and rub with a light touch; you
only want to remove the scratches in the finish without damaging
the stain underneath. Work cautiously near the edges or corners,
they can easily wear through.
</P>
<P>
   When the scratches are removed, wipe with a rag and mineral
spirits. Go over the area several times, opening the cloth
frequently to uncover clean fabric. You must remove all traces of
the Danish oil or it will repel the new finish.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the surface to dry thoroughly, at least 24 hours, then
spray it with a coat of clear lacquer. Hold the can at a 45-degree
angle about eight inches from the furniture surface. Press the
spray button and move the can in a continuous motion in line with
the grain.
</P>
<P>
   You may need to make several passes to cover a wide area. After
each pass, wipe the spray nozzle to prevent drips. Use newspapers
to cover areas that you don't want coated.. It takes a bit of
practice to spray lacquer in a smooth coat, so you may want to try
this technique on a piece of cardboard before committing yourself
to the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Scratches that cut through the finish into the wood are lighter
in color than the surrounding wood and stand out as eyesores. These
must be colored so they blend with the adjacent area. You can use
an artist's permanent felt-tip marker, available in a variety of
colors in art supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   Gouges are deep scratches that must be filled as well as
colored; otherwise they will collect dirt and become permanently
discolored. Use colored furniture sticks for a filler and coloring
agent. Although these sticks come in a variety of colors, it is
unlikely that you will find one stick with the exact color of your
furniture. Buy several and blend them together to get a good color
match.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape a few flakes from each stick and knead them together with
your fingers. The kneading will blend the colors together and make
the putty pliable enough to press into the gouge. Use a small flat
stick or spatula to smooth the filler and to scrape away any
excess. Do not attempt to apply lacquer directly over the putty;
this will prevent it from drying properly and turn it into a sticky
blob. Instead, seal the patch with a light spray of shellac. This
will allow the putty to harden although it will remain pliable for
some time.

GETTING TO THE LAND OF OZ IS EASIER ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Lyman Frank Baum, a gentle man with a gift for storytelling, was
entertaining his sons and their friends in Chicago one day in 1898.
He began a tale about a girl named Dorothy and how she met a
scarecrow. ``Where did they live?'' a small voice asked. As the
account goes, he looked at his two file drawers, A-N and O-Z.
</P>
<P>
   Next year is the publication centennial of America's greatest
fairyland, one that Baum created without the Grimms' horror or
ugliness or moralizing. The International Wizard of Oz Club
(www.ozclub.org) is already hard at work on a celebration July
20-23 at Indiana University at Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
   There will be scholarly papers (27 and growing), performances of
early Oz plays and films, an exhibition of rare Oziana and perhaps
a Russian Oz author _ Russians may not have invented the Emerald
City, but they and others are still expanding it.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Albright of Kansas City, Mo., vice president of the club
and the organizer of the centennial, wrote by e-mail that her
interest in Oz had begun with a dozen Oz books before she had even
known how to read. ``I simply opened them and fell in love,'' she
wrote. ``The sense of place Baum created in Oz was as tangible to
me as Kansas _ I was raised in Topeka. I've yet to encounter any
other fantasy land as utterly convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Club members, and the countless fans who learned to read and
loved to dream on the Oz books, grieve that so many people know
only about a movie. There's a reason for that, and it makes Oz
online doubly important. The Oz books can be hard to find without a
Web guide. They have often been unpopular with teachers and
librarians _ for having no formal educational purpose, for not
preaching, for being too funny, too irreverent, too easy to read,
too imaginative, too undignified. Baum's style is simple and often
repetitive; it is his imagination that is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous Wonderful Wizard of Oz Web site by Eric Gjovaag
(www.eskimo.com/tiktok) has a history of Oz, information about the
centennial convention, lesson ideas for teachers, a message board
and Oz updates. Its 19-chapter Frequently Asked Questions about Oz
provide an exhaustive resource for every conceivable aspect of
Oziana in print, and on stage and screen.
</P>
<P>
   Gjovaag's site debunks two of the most frequent false rumors
about Oz. No, there is not a hanged man in the forest scene in the
movie, and no, Baum did not set out to write a parable about
populism. That myth arose from a 1964 article in the magazine
American Quarterly by a high-school teacher, Henry M. Littlefield,
who used Oz as an allegory to teach about the populist movement and
the election of 1896. Littlefield has since written that there is
no evidence that Baum intended a political message.
</P>
<P>
   The Emerald City of Oz site (www.emeraldcityofoz.com) has an
extensive online library, with both summaries and full text, of the
Oz books by Baum and by his successor as ``Royal Historian of Oz,''
Ruth Plumly Thompson, as well as the artist John R. Neill and later
successors. The Oz Library (homes.acmecity.com/oz/baum/123)
includes the text of 21 Oz books, plus many illustrations, as well
as the complete script for the 1939 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Jim's Wizard of Oz Website
(www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/6396/index.html) has a good deal
of magic itself. On its Mouseovers Page, the movie's main
characters are shown as they appear in Kansas. Rolling the cursor
over them turns them into their Oz equivalents. The official Warner
Brothers Wizard of Oz movie site is
www.thewizardofoz.com/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   As for the synchronicity between the movie and Pink Floyd's 1973
album ``Dark Side of the Moon,'' which members of the rock group
have denied is intentional, try
www.xnet.com/arkiver/synch/dsotr.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   Piglet Press (www.halcyon.com/piglet/index.htm) produces and
sells audio versions of many Oz books; its Web site has many online
listening selections. Piglet Press also has a wonderfully
illustrated cross-referenced Oz encyclopedia. Try it out using one
of the best names in Oz: the Lord High Chigglewitz. The Piglet
index will remind you that his real name is Larry and he is the
chief Fuddleperson in Fuddlecumjig (in the north of the Quadling
country). He uses his jigsaw-puzzle skills to piece together the
Fuddles, who fly apart at the slightest provocation ... oh, never
mind. Just read ``The Emerald City of Oz.''

RAZZLE-DAZZLE LOOK AT THE CIVIL WAR ON DISC

   &UR; THE CIVIL WAR EXPERIENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SouthPeak Interactive; $40; CD-ROM for Windows 95 and 98.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   From almost every perspective _ political, economic, moral,
military _ the Civil War remains the defining moment in our
history. More than 600,000 soldiers died, a president was
assassinated, and 4 million slaves were freed. In its aftermath,
one region lay in ruins, but most Americans prospered as never
before: Their country had been saved, its government strengthened,
its indivisibility preserved.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking to understand this conflict's remarkable grip
on our collective imagination, The Civil War Experience is a good
place to start. Bulging with information, beautifully put together
and simple to navigate, it combines serious history with mindless
(though mildly addictive) razzle-dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   Made in conjunction with the History Channel, the disc includes
150 top-flight biographies of leading Civil War figures and dozens
of topical essays supplemented by video clips and eyewitness
accounts. There are video games that allow you to blast the enemy
with cannon fire and run a Confederate naval blockade. There is
also a trivia game that I strongly urge overconfident historians to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The opening section of this CD-ROM, The Road to War, is
disappointing. Essays on topics like the Missouri Compromise
(1820-1821), the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) and the Dred Scott
decision (1857) provide some historical background, a sound idea,
except that the essays, alas, are flat, poorly connected and
confuse the slavery issue. In the Dred Scott essay, for example, we
are told that ``Southerners saw the decision as a guarantee that
slavery would be protected within Southern borders.'' In fact, that
point had long been conceded by most Northerners, Lincoln among
them. What Southerners really saw in the Dred Scott decision was a
guarantee that slavery would be protected into the vast federal
territory acquired in the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican War.
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers, I suspect, will peruse The Civil War Experience
for important people and events, like Gen. Robert E. Lee, the
Battle of Gettysburg and the Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   The search functions are excellent. Following simple
instructions, I began my journey by typing in ``Stonewall.''
Eighteen sources for Gen. Thomas J. Jackson appeared, each
accessible with the click of a mouse. I learned that he got his
nickname after standing firm at the First Battle of Bull Run and
that his battlefield tactics, marked by supreme self-confidence and
personal fury, were responsible for much of the South's early
military success. I also discovered that this eccentric general,
believing one side of his body to be larger than the other, kept an
arm raised skyward to increase the flow of blood to his less
developed side and purposely ate food he hated in the hope that
denial of pleasure would make him ``morally better.'' When Jackson
fell at Chancellorsville in 1863, shot accidentally by his own
troops, the hopes of the South may have died with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War Experience contains a military time line detailing
every skirmish from 1861 through 1865, with major battles like
Shiloh, Antietam, Gettysburg and Vicksburg receiving lavish
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced perhaps by Ken Burns' ``Civil War'' documentary, the
disc's makers included grainy photographs of bloated corpses,
muffled sounds of cannon fire and cavalry charges, somber
renderings of eyewitness accounts and talking heads explaining the
finer points of warfare. Major battles are divided into days,
sometimes hours, with excellent maps.
</P>
<P>
   Military buffs will find much to admire. Want to know the sort
of shells that Union gunners lobbed toward Confederate lines? Click
on Artillery. Want to know the colors of the 15th Kentucky Infantry
Regiment? Click on Flags of War. Want to know how many Jewish
soldiers fought for each side? Click on Ethnic Regiments. (The
answer: 5,500 Jews for the North, 3,000 for the South.) Those
craving more information will find that Jews were ``less prone to
bacteria-based diseases'' because they ate kosher food.
</P>
<P>
   The best parts of The Civil War Experience document the daily
lives of soldiers, civilians and slaves _ their work, clothes,
food, games and music. You can follow a young infantryman or naval
officer, on either side, from enlistment through discharge or
death.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful section portrays the horrors of prison camps like
Andersonville in Georgia and Elmira in upstate New York. Some
420,000 soldiers from both sides were penned up like animals and
nearly 50,000 died.
</P>
<P>
   A section about medical care details things like the workings of
a field hospital where amputations were performed with a saw, some
whiskey and large doses of opium and morphine. Those who survived
often faced a life of drug addition _ known as Old Soldier's
Disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War Experience offers an exceptional, almost
smothering, coverage of events. What it lacks _ what it may have
consciously avoided _ is an overview of the conflict that weaves
together important events into a coherent whole. How, exactly, did
the Union victory at Antietam alter President Lincoln's plans for
the abolition of slavery? What impact did the Civil War's
revolutionary technological advances have upon America's future
industrial growth? Why, in the end, do we consider this glorious
bloodletting to be the most important event in our nation's
history? For answers to questions like these, a trip to the public
library is still very much in order.

TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST (AND THE COMPUTER) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Colo., N.C., Senegal, Brazil, Trinidad, Thailand)   (Circuits)  
(DW) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If wind, weather and luck hold out, the crew of the Makulu II, a
43-foot sailboat-turned-cyberspace-classroom, is expected to
complete a two-year voyage around the world on Saturday by sailing
into a Florida marina not far from where it started. But that news
would hardly be a surprise to the thousands, perhaps millions, of
students and the simply curious who have been following the crew's
exploits and explorations by way of e-mail and the crew's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mariners of old, the six young men and women on board,
who look more like Ralph Lauren models than ship-weary sailors,
have been using computer technology to take anyone with access to
the World Wide Web along with them _ virtually, of course.
</P>
<P>
   They have shared practically everything online, like digital
pictures of their underwear drying in the sea breeze and weekly log
entries describing their adventures, as well as funeral rituals in
Southeast Asia, Carnival celebrations in Gibraltar and a solemn
tour of a former slave-trade house on an island off the coast of
West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There have been the dispatches, sometimes routine and sometimes
hauntingly honest, uploaded to the Net from the Makulu II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossing from Senegal to Brazil in this season is proving more
difficult than we thought!'' reads one of the weekly updates posted
on the Makulu II's Web site, www.reachtheworld.org. ``We did NOT
find the wind that we hoped would carry us southwest to Brazil. As
a result, we have changed our plan and are heading directly to
Trinidad, a 2,200-plus-mile passage that could take as long as 40
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The interactive adventure has all been done in the cause of
education _ that of the crew and, most important, the students who
are part of a global network of classrooms linked to the Makulu II
over the Internet, said Heather Halstead, the 25-year-old creator
and co-captain of the project. The crew receives as many as 200
messages a month from students and teachers. They are part of a
project that would not be possible without the relatively low-cost
computer-assisted communications available today, Ms. Halstead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been into teaching my whole life,'' Ms. Halstead
said in an interview in New York while on a break from the voyage
during which she visited with her family and some of the project's
participating schools. ``And I always knew I wanted to sail around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious fun Ms. Halstead and her crew have had, the
pictures and dispatches that have been streaming from the crew have
hardly been the stuff of vacation postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Halstead, with the help of a group of educators,
created a curriculum center online that helps classroom teachers
use the experiences of the Makulu II crew to learn and teach about
world cultures and more. There have been lesson and activity guides
that have covered, among other subjects, African art and gravestone
art, world languages, origin myths and astronomy, cartography and
weather forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   The sailboat uses satellite-assisted navigation and
communications, which include an on-board telephone and e-mail. But
the services are expensive, she said. The telephone, which uses a
technology called side band radio that bounces signals off the
atmosphere, costs about $5 a minute, and e-mail costs almost a
penny per character, Ms. Halstead said. The crew also uses much
cheaper e-mail systems at cybercafes when it can find them on land,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   By communicating directly with Ms. Halstead, a sixth-grade class
was able to persuade the Makulu II crew to swing by Singapore to
complete a fact-finding itinerary; another school asked the crew to
ask middle school students in the Cook Islands questions they had
about their lives here; still another school used the Makulu II to
chat with children in a Thai fishing village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful experience for my students to be able to
feel a connection to real people as they studied the classroom
maps,'' said Pat Palazzolo, a ninth-grade teacher at the Upper St.
Clair High School in Clair, Pa. ``My students were fascinated by
the idea of people not much older than themselves involved in such
as adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining her interests in education and circumnavigating the
planet was far from easy for Ms. Halstead. Shortly after graduating
from Dartmouth in 1997 with an honors degree in American social
history and education, Ms. Halstead decided that she would indeed
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The product of an affluent New York family, Ms. Halstead was
able to use money she inherited from her paternal grandfather _ the
inspiration for the voyage _ to buy the yacht with the idea of
recovering the money by selling the boat once the trip was
completed. But buying a ocean-going vessel was only the beginning.
She created the Reach the World Co., a nonprofit group that became
the organization base for the voyage and related educational
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Then in quick order, she said, she had to teach herself how to
insure a boat (something that would come in handy during the trip),
equip it so that she could communicate with students and teachers,
and select a crew.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a co-captain was simple. Ms. Halstead, who as a child
was terrified of boats, later fell in love with them at a summer
sailing camp she attended in the British Virgin Islands.
Eventually, she became an instructor and developed, she said, the
confidence to believe she could sail around the world. Sailing was
also in her blood. Her father, Clark Halstead, sails and her
maternal grandfather was a cruise director and merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   As an instructor at the sailing camp, Ms. Halstead met Marc
Gustafson, also an instructor and an able sailor. Together, she and
Gustafson, who is 22 and a graduate of Elon College in North
Carolina and the Chapman School of Seamanship in Stuart, Fla., are
the Makulu II's skippers.
</P>
<P>
   The co-captains' first two days at the helm of the Makulu II
(which in Zulu roughly means ``big mama'') were not promising. In
trying to move the boat to a marina where the voyage would begin,
Gustafson ran it aground three times _ hard _ along Florida's
intercoastal waterway from Titusville to Fort Lauderdale before he
got the feel of the sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a disaster,'' Ms. Halstead recalled. ``We were
discouraged, to say the least. We're like, we're never going to get
out of Florida. It's funny to look back on it now.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crew members have numbered more than two dozen friends,
relatives and other volunteers who have sailed passages on the
Makulu II of varying lengths. The current crew has been onboard for
a semester. Each is required to contribute $1,000 a month to help
cover the cost of the voyage. Other costs are covered by donations
and grants to Reach the World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't believe she was going to pull it off,'' her
mother, Carol Halstead, said with a chuckle. ``But we kind of
encouraged her. Now the fact is that she is making it happen and it
is awe inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn McCullough, 29, a former wilderness ranger from Boulder,
Colo., with little ocean-sailing experience, joined the crew in the
fall. He said he was sold on the idea shortly after speaking with
Heather Halstead and remembering how ``she was constantly sparking,
never letting the fire die out'' of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that excited me most,'' McCullough said, was having a
child be able to write to us on the ocean and say, `Can you take a
picture of the sunrise in the middle of the Atlantic?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halstead knows the feeling. Having taught in challenging
environments before, from the backwoods of Colorado to the bush in
Kenya during a semester break from college, she said she was moved
to create the floating classroom on the Makulu II to give teachers
and students richer resources with which to better explore the
world and its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been out there long enough to see what the connections
are between different regions,'' she said, noting that she had been
able to see traces of different languages from the east coast of
Africa to the Middle East and various movements in dances in widely
separated cultures in the South Pacific, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of had this idea of the world being an overlapping
of concentric circles, of cultural influences,'' Ms. Halstead said.
``It's really there. I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   While she and her crew have had trouble, including ripped sails
and serious engine trouble 50 hours out of Trinidad, the Makulu II
is expected to reach the Florida coast on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When it arrives, Carol Halstead said, she will be both proud and
relieved. ``They have learned so much,'' she said of the voyage,
``but it has been a school of hard knocks.''

IMAGE IS KEY TO SELLING NOKIA'S $799 CELL PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<P>
   When it comes to claiming the hearts and pockets of the
disposable income crowd, Nokia doesn't mess around.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent millions on print and television
advertising, event sponsorship and product placement for its
high-priced 8860 cell phone, and at last September's Emmy awards,
Nokia gave one to everyone who won or presented an award. ``Believe
you me, every single person who did not win an Emmy called
afterward, wanting one,'' said Megan Matthews, a Nokia spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Nice party favors, but at $799, are they selling? Apparently so.
</P>
<P>
   The 8860 was already a hot item in Europe and Asia when it made
its official debut in AT&AMP;T Wireless stores last month. Ken Woo, a
spokesman for AT&AMP;T Wireless, said the phone was selling well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Woo said, he got a call from Barbara Walters'
assistant, inquiring about discounts. Ms. Walters, who recently
praised the phone on the air, wants to give away a half-dozen of
them as Christmas gifts, the assistant told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a high end device, it's selling quite well,'' said Brian
Modoff, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia is the 11th most recognized brand worldwide, ahead of
Mercedes, according to Interbrand, a consulting firm. ``They're
selling an image, not technology,'' Modoff said. ``They're very
good at technology, but image is the key.''  &QR;

DEFINITIVELY CORRECT BEHAVIOR, AVAILABLE IN ENCYCLOPEDIC DETAIL

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in time for holiday entertaining, Emily Post's
``Etiquette'' has been published on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bartleby.com, the publisher of classic fiction, nonfiction and
reference works on the Web, has posted the original 1922 edition of
``Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home'' to
add to its growing library of reference books, including Bartlett's
``Familiar Quotations'' (ninth edition) and Strunk and White's
``Elements of Style.''
</P>
<P>
   When originally published, ``Etiquette'' was an instant hit,
selling one million copies, said Steven Van Leewan, founder and
publisher of Bartleby.com (www.bartleby.com). The book has since
gone through 16 revisions. ``Emily Post was a literary writer,
philosopher and feminist,'' Van Leewan said, ``a self-made woman
who was old-fashioned in a sense but who wanted this decorum to be
available to every American.''
</P>
<P>
   In the original edition of ``Etiquette,'' Mrs. Post's popular,
finger-wagging prose advised the nouveaux riches of the 1920s on
topics like how to dress their servants for a stand-up luncheon,
when women should remove their hats (almost never) and how to ask
someone to fill a place at a party when another guest suddenly
cancels (make sure they are very good friends and don't explain a
thing).
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, an index allows readers to quickly scan through
1,500 subjects like ``Have Silver That Shines or None'' and ``The
`Cut Direct,''' which Mrs. Post explains as ignoring someone
standing directly in front of you on purpose, which ``is
practically unknown in polite society.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Post's 38 chapters on deportment may at first glance
seem arcane, much of her advice has trickled down and out into
modern-day living. Van Leewan noted that a perusal of the first
edition of ``Etiquette'' shows that good manners never change no
matter the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has advice on the subject. The etiquette-impaired can now
find updated advice about comportment on Web sites like How2.com
(www.how2.com) and Learn2.com (www.learn2.com). Though lacking Mrs.
Post's saucy style, these sites do touch on the essentials.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, How2.com offered a tutorial on uncorking a champagne
bottle without having champagne shoot across the living room.
Another How2.com lesson advised would-be dinner party givers on how
to set a formal table. The first rule: make it elegant. After the
party is over and the guests have gone, you can turn to Learn2.com

VIRTUAL PARENTHOOD, COMPLETE WITH MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By J.C. HERZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stepford babies have arrived. Or rather, Babyz, the latest
virtual pet product from Mindscape, the company that brought us
Catz, Dogz and Creatures. Imagine Cabbage Patch dolls in the
twilight zone with an Internet master plan, and you begin to grasp
the insidious genius of Babyz.
</P>
<P>
   They're sold like Cabbage Patch dolls or puppies at the pound _
each package shows a picture of the virtual bundle of joy inside,
unique in all the world and waiting to be adopted and snuggled and
loved, along with 15 siblings also stored on disc. They're too
scrumptious for words, and they all have serial numbers _ in my
case, 5725-qcqa-aaaD-gbd, a roly-poly, towheaded little girl,
Cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Upon installation, the Babyz software requires a formal adoption
agreement before you can get any further into the program. (``I,
J.C., promise to love and care for Cookie, my newly adopted Babyz.
Every day that I play with Babyz, I will feed and play with Cookie.
I promise to nurture Cookie when sick and clean up after Cookie's
messes. I will be the best caretaker I can be and give Cookie a
good home.'')
</P>
<P>
   You sigh. Click Adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to virtual parenthood: animated nursery toys,
storybooks, gurgles, mashed peas and dirty diapers. Mercifully, the
software does not support the DigiScents virtual odor technology.
But Babyz does support voice recognition _ it even comes with a
microphone so you can sit in front of your computer and repeat
single syllables in a high singsong voice in hopes that your
precious little string of ones and zeroes will learn to talk.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually acquire a vocabulary of 70 words if you're
sufficiently attentive and don't have any hang-ups about cooing,
``Ma, ma-MAH? MA-ma,'' to a monitor for hours on end. A text bar at
the bottom of the screen flashes hints and tips for the clueless
and negligent. ``Don't forget to give your Babyz tickles when
they've been good and to discourage naughty behaviors by telling
your Babyz `no,' using the microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't spank Babyz or do anything abusive if you lose your
temper or get annoyed with the program. But in a world where
toddlers can simply be turned off, who needs corporal punishment?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are multiple opportunities to show
Babyz how much you love them. The hint bar has an endless stream of
suggestions, most of which involve baby accessories: clothing,
toys, a scrapbook to be filled with screen shots of candid Babyz
moments. And above all, the constant and insistent reminders to
visit the Babyz Web site, www.babyz.net: ``Talk to other Babyz
owners on the Babyz Talk bulletin board, visit the Babyz Gallery
and download new toyz and clothes. Find tips on how to care for
your Babyz and don't forget to check out the Babyz Linkz pages!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is my imagination, but these reminders seem to
intensify the longer you go without visiting the Web site until,
like the parent of a feverish baby screaming in the middle of the
night, you relent. (``Yes, OK, OK, OK, I'll visit the Web site.
Shhhh. Shhhh.'')
</P>
<P>
   It is on the Babyz Web site that you realize the full scope and
extent of mind control enabled by this technology (paging Serling
... ).
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there is the adoption center where, after an
extremely coercive registration process, you can peruse a
searchable database of new Babyz to add to your collection. Hair
color, eye color, sex, complexion, you name it _ it's Gattaca in
booties.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist of eugenics, the Babyz sought are, like their
prospective parents, overwhelmingly female, and the cast-off orphan
babies are male. If you read the want ads, everyone is looking for
a little girl with green eyes and three pigtails and trying to
unload the little bald boys with glowing descriptions and requests
for good homes.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a system of foster programs, homeless shelters and
orphanages that lets you borrow unwanted Babyz for a while, without
the obligation to adopt. For the luckier Babyz who are chosen and
coddled, there is a whole range of user-run services: hospitals
that nurse sick Babyz back to health, day care centers with
real-world nannyz to tend your Babyz during the day and preschools
that will train your virtual offspring to read and play
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   A gallery allows proud parentz to show off pictures of their
Babyz. That goes on for hundreds of pages, with captions
(``Brittany,'' ``Trixie,'' ``Alexa,'' ``Pandora and Megan,''
``Katie standing,'' ``Katie asking for another block,'' ``Lara,''
``Lara awww my lil angel,'' ``Lara, yes her again AWWW.''). Most of
the pictures are of girls, with the notable exceptions of the
triplets Kyle, Brandon and Dillon, always pictured together, often
in costume. Kyle, Brandon and Dillon dressed as Men in Black. Kyle,
Brandon and Dillon as a pilgrim, a turkey and an Indian brave for
Thanksgiving, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the conspicuous display of toddlers one step further, the
site also features a number of pageants that require contestants to
submit images, along with explanations of why the virtual tot
deserves to win. The Babyz' moms often stress that a pageant
victory would increase their virtual infants' self-esteem. ``I love
my little Elizabeth so much,'' wrote Elizabeth's mother, Caroline,
``I'd be so proud if she'd win. I also know that she'd feel very
happy to know that she's won in something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her to death,'' said Casey's mom, also named Casey,
``and because I worked so hard on the picture. Plus she is just
learning to walk and if there was a certificate that came with
winning or something, I would put it in a frame on Babyz so Case
can see it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never too soon to start pushing Babyz _ you know how
difficult it is to get into the right schoolz.

PROTESTER ACCUSES LUMBER COMPANY OF TRYING TO SILENCE HER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Julia ``Butterfly'' Hill is ready to descend
from the lofty old redwood tree that has been her home for two
years, but only if she can reach agreement with the Pacific Lumber
Co. to protect the towering giant she calls ``Luna.''
</P>
<P>
   The trespassing protester and the company are still working on a
deal to end her sit-in, but she accuses the lumber outfit of trying
to muzzle her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to see how much of my life they can control
once I come down,'' said Hill, whose protest in the 600-year-old
tree has drawn worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Reiss, a spokesman for the Maxxam Corp., the Houston-based
conglomerate that owns Pacific Lumber, denied that the company was
trying to muzzle Hill. It wants only to insure her safety and
discourage other environmental activists from protesting by
tree-sitting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber, which owns the land, has agreed not to cut down
the tree and to leave an unlogged buffer zone of 200 feet around
it, Hill said. But as a condition of that agreement, ``they want to
control what I say and do, and they don't have that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago on Friday, Hill, 25, ascended the tree, which
dominates a stand of timber owned by Pacific Lumber on a 1,700-foot
ridge above the Northern California town of Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   A second anniversary rally by her supporters is scheduled Sunday
in Stafford. ``It would be wonderful to me to be on the ground, but
it's not up to me,'' Hill said. ``My feet won't touch ground until
that company has put ink to paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's life has been circumscribed by a tarpaulin-covered,
8-foot by 8-foot platform 180 feet up the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she and representatives of Pacific Lumber, reached
agreement in principal for her to end her protest some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been in writing for months and months and months,'' she
said. ``All we needed was a land survey and signatures. But then
Pacific Lumber went incommunicado'' until recently, when she said
the company ``proposed new changes,'' including the payment of
$50,000 in exchange for the company's pledge not to log the site.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the company would require a payment from Hill, Reiss
said, ``This is not a money-making scheme for Pacific Lumber ... or
for anyone engaged in an illegal, dangerous activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about her safety and that of others who have
followed her example by trespassing on private property and
engaging in illegal tree-sitting,'' Reiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, ``we don't think this should become a
money-making scheme for her or her associates. She has a book deal.
There are promotional videos. There are T-shirts you can purchase.
... We respect her passion to preserve the environment, but
engaging in an illegal tree sit is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's book, ``The Legacy of Luna,'' will be published in March
by Harper San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the proceeds from the book deal are donated to the
Circle of Life Foundation to continue the work that (Hill) began in
Luna, helping to network grass roots organizations across the
United States and informing the broadest audience possible about
environmental and social justice issues,'' said Nancy Fourwater of
the Circle of Life Foundation in Redway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julia gets no financial compensation from this deal,''
Fourwater said. Maxxam ``is trying to censor what she can and
cannot say, and that's a sticking point right now. She won't be
censored.''
</P>
<P>
   What troubles Hill about signing an agreement and relinquishing
her perch in Luna is that ``some of their terms were stipulations
about what I would or could not do on their property if I agree to
this document.''
</P>
<P>
   She would not be specific about the proposed restrictions,
citing a confidentiality agreement, which she said Pacific Lumber
has violated by repeated leaks, a charge that Weiss denies.
</P>
<P>
   The tree was being lashed by a Pacific hailstorm while Hill was
being interviewed, and the tree is frequently buffeted by high wind
and heavy rain during the winter.

LEGAL SQUABBLES IN PATH OF INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the recurring dreams of technology utopians is the idea
of the celestial jukebox. It's a metaphor for the Web of the future
in which individual terminals will have access to great digital
warehouses in the sky packed with petabits of digitally stored CDs,
books, television shows and any other copyrighted information or
entertainment imaginable _ all for micropayments too small to pinch
the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that consumers of the future will pay a few dollars
or cents _ or even a fraction of a cent _ to watch an episode of
``I Love Lucy,'' listen to an aria by Bryn Terfel or view a missed
Chemistry 101 lecture, deliverable on the spot to home or office.
</P>
<P>
   There are already companies like 1ClickCharge or Qpass that let
people run a chit or bill a credit card for single, low-cost items.
Some experts say companies like these will become part of a
gigantic business that will make it easy for consumers to buy
information or entertainment in small segments.
</P>
<P>
   As technology changes, the celestial jukebox will surely become
possible. In fact, it may be that the stickiest issues will involve
legal, not technical, questions. ``The juggernaut is moving _
there's an internal market logic to the celestial jukebox,'' said
Dr. Paul Goldstein, a law professor at Stanford University and
author of ``Copyright's Highway: From Gutenberg to the Celestial
Jukebox'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, 1994). ``But first there are hurdles to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The hurdles Goldstein and others speak of are the tangled legal
issues of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights _ known
collectively as intellectual property issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property used to be a relative backwater, a
fairly quiet territory,'' said Rory Radding, a partner at the
Pennie &AMP; Edmonds law firm in New York. ``But the Internet has made
it red hot, right up there on the radar screen.'' Radding is
chairman of the New York State Bar Association's committee on
intellectual property on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the intellectual property issues associated with the
Internet involve the protection of copyrighted materials, like
music and books. New encryption methods are being developed to
prevent the unauthorized distribution of such material over the
Internet, but one question is how much encryption should be used to
prevent piracy without at the same time stifling a market.
</P>
<P>
   Patent disputes can involve the methods used to conduct business
over the Internet, not just the material being sold. The
business-methods issue arises from a ruling in July 1998 by the
Federal Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which ruled that companies
could patent such methods. In that case, the method involved a
computer system for managing portfolios. For 100 years, courts had
held that business methods themselves could not be patented, said
Barry Rein, a partner at Pennie &AMP; Edmonds, but the 1998 ruling ran
counter to that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet companies promptly started filing patents for
their methods, and some of them then sued other companies for
infringement. Amazon.com, for instance, won a patent for
``one-click ordering,'' an express service that lets customers
place orders without re-entering financial information each time
they buy. Amazon.com subsequently sued Barnesandnoble.com for its
one-click ``express lane'' method, saying it infringed on
Amazon.com's one-click patent.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon won the first round in this dispute: Last week a U.S.
District Court judge in Seattle issued a preliminary injunction
ordering Barnesandnoble.com to stop using the one-click system
because of Amazon's patent claim.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is significant because companies often use similar
software to do business online. ``Any new entrant into commercial
space on the celestial jukebox has to worry about its business plan
being cut off at the knees by a patent infringement lawsuit,''
Goldstein said. ``This issue could effectively bring e-commerce to
a halt.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hagen, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass., said companies who spend fortunes to set up retail Internet
sites might be given pause by the specter of patent infringement
suits. ``They won't keep on investing unless that money is
protected,'' he said. ``And when you have a patent on such a vague
process, you can completely chill an entire marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the field say the law alone is not going to solve
infringement issues. ``Intellectual property owners will look for
alternatives to the legal system,'' said Dr. David Post, a law
professor at Temple University who originated one of the first
Internet law courses. ``If I'm sitting on $100 million in
intellectual property, I'm not going to wait around for the complex
legal world to sort itself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Post predicted that in the recording industry, encryption would
be the solution to intellectual property problems. ``The recording
industry will eventually succeed in promulgating standards that
will allow them to encrypt files so they can't be accessed without
contractual terms and conditions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Allen, an analyst who is the lead author of a Forrester
report called ``The Intellectual Property Mess,'' said encryption
would take the owners of intellectual property rights only so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rights owners can't rely on technology alone to stop
infringement'' if they are going to be able to compete in the
e-commerce market of the future, she said. ``If you don't want to
miss out on $3.2 trillion in commerce worldwide by 2003, you're
going to have to think of other solutions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen draws a parallel with the fight the movie industry had
over VCRs because it thought the devices would hurt its business.
``If this had continued, the industry would have missed out on a
new revenue stream,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Post recognizes the complex problems of intellectual property
rights on the Internet, but he is confident that the age of the
celestial jukebox will arrive anyway. ``I can't sell you access to
my course for a few pennies yet, but the arrow is clearly pointing
in that direction,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Is Brien Taylor, the teen-age pitcher signed by the
Yankees around 10 years ago, still trying to reach the major
leagues? _ R.C., Thompson, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Taylor, who was 19 when he was first pick in the 1991
amateur draft, worked out with a Class A team of the Cleveland
Indians in August.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees gave Taylor a record $1.55 million bonus in
1991 but let him become a free agent in 1998. He was signed to a
minor league contract by the Seattle Mariners and then released in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after being drafted, Taylor got into a bar fight with
a childhood friend and injured his throwing shoulder. His
minor-league record over the past three seasons is 1-10.
</P>
<P>

57th St., No. 203, New York, NY 10019.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's weekly documentary series ``The Awful Truth'' airs on
the Bravo cable channel. The show, which was nominated for an Emmy,
begins its second season early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary filmmaker also writes regularly on his Web site:
www.michaelmoore.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I find tapes of the TV series ``Twin Peaks?''
_ W.J.M., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>

CHILD ACTRESS TREASURED FILM ROLE AS A HIGH SPOT IN LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERY STEWART 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karolyn Grimes likes to say that she has been in bed with some
of the biggest stars in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   A juvenile actress in movies during the 1940s, Grimes shared the
screen with John Wayne, Bing Crosby, Cary Grant, David Niven and
other screen notables. Her most memorable portrayal was Zuzu,
daughter of Everyguy hero George Bailey in director Frank Capra's
classic 1946 film, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I played everyone's daughter back then,'' Grimes said. ``It
seems they were always tucking me into bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Karolyn's screen father in ``Wonderful Life'' was, of
course, James Stewart. It's hardly a surprise that when Grimes
makes personal appearances to share her memories of the film, the
question she is most often asked is, ``What was it like working
with Jimmy Stewart?''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes' ``Wonderful'' travels brought her to Fort Worth last
week, when a live theater production of ``It's a Wonderful Life''
opened at Stage West. As she visited with first-nighters, the
Stewart query brought an answer that was succinct and appropriate:
``Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old Karolyn looked up to Stewart, figuratively and
literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, he was 6-4,'' Grimes said. ``He was very patient.
Among other things, he taught me that it was all right to fluff a
line.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Grimes did not fluff Zuzu's famous line: ``Every
time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.'' It's probably the
most-quoted sentence of a movie that is part of America's holiday
tradition, thanks largely to Stewart's performance as a
self-doubting man who (with the help of a wingless apprentice
angel) comes to realize that he has enriched many lives.
</P>
<P>
   The film was not always thus embraced, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a success when it first came out,'' Grimes said.
``It lost $500,000 at the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Grimes feels, is that the movie was marketed as a
romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is kind of dark. Capra shot three endings for the
picture. And while the one he wound up using was happy, don't
forget that evil was not punished. Mr. Potter was never exposed for
taking that $8,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Barrymore, who portrayed Mr. Potter, was reshaped for the
role, Grimes revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The makeup people remade his head,'' she said. ``They made it
bigger, so he would look more formidable.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wonderful Life'' radio play currently at Stage West is
co-produced by Texas Wesleyan University and the WARM Place. The
latter, an acronym for What About Remembering Me, is a nonprofit
agency providing grief support to children, their families and
young adults who have lost a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes was happy to lend her celebrity to such a project,
because she has had her share of grieving and coping.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, my mother died. She had been sick for several
years. Then my father got killed in an automobile accident when I
was 15. That was the end of my Hollywood career. I became an
orphan, and the court shipped me to a little town in Missouri
called Osceola. I lived with my father's brother. It wasn't a great
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Grimes outlived two husbands and a son.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I've been there, done it. I can't really help anybody else,
except to tell them what I did to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The eventual popularity of ``It's a Wonderful Life'' spawned a
cottage industry for Grimes and her husband, psychologist Chris
Brunell. . Working out of their home in Carnation, Wash., they
publish a slick-looking newsletter, ``The Zuzu News,'' official
organ of the Zuzu Society, which is Web-sited at www.zuzu.net.
</P>
<P>
   Through the magazine and at personal appearances, Grimes markets
``Wonderful Life''-related souvenirs. (Yes, one of them is a bell.
Did you have to ask?)

PUSHING `MANLY' BEHAVIOR IS A MISTAKE, EXPERTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rebecca Edwards visited a local kindergarten class on the
first day of school, she was amazed to see something she would
never have noticed if she weren't looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a community educator at the Parenting Center in Fort
Worth, watched parents bring their children into the classroom and
attempt to calm their inevitable separation anxieties. While the
parents of some girls in the classroom lingered to ease their
daughters' transition, the teacher asked the only remaining mother
of a boy to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was more accepting of mothers staying with their
daughters,'' Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Edwards could tell, it was a textbook example of what
psychologist William Pollack means when he writes that, unlike
girls, ``Boys are pushed to separate from their mother
prematurely.'' The consequences, the Harvard Medical School
professor said, can be traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that society treats boys differently than
girls, just as it treats men differently than women. But a growing
chorus of psychologists and sociologists is warning that our
expectations for boys may be harmful to them. Our tendency to steer
them toward traditional male roles, they say, may be curbing their
natural identities or, in extreme cases, propelling them to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys today are in serious trouble,'' begins Pollack's
oft-cited book ``Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of
Boyhood.'' Pollack's assertions _ that boys are forced to be too
independent too soon and are shamed into adhering to a strict,
traditional code of manhood _ are shared by numerous experts. Many
are beginning to speak up, and parents are taking note.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards bought ``Real Boys'' after seeing Pollack interviewed on
``The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' Spurred by his message, Edwards offered
the first ``Raising Sons'' class through the Parenting Center in
September, attracting twice as many people as the class on raising
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are increasingly concerned about the kinds of
messages that we bombard our male children and male adolescents
with,'' says David Lisak, an associate professor of psychology at
the University of Massachusetts-Boston. Cumulatively, he notes,
those messages ``have the effect of instilling in them the sense
that there are certain parts of their humanity that they really
need to disavow.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack calls it the ``Boy Code'': ``a set of behaviors, rules
of conduct, cultural shibboleths and even a lexicon, that is
inculcated into boys by our society _ from the very beginning of a
boy's life.'' Long before their first day of kindergarten, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the code is based on ``outmoded ideas of
masculinity,'' Pollack writes, including the long-held beliefs that
men should be emotionally stoic and not too sensitive or dependent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are allowed to be courageous and strong,'' says Edwards,
``but they're not allowed to be fearful, they're not allowed to be
vulnerable, and they're not even allowed to be some good feelings
like gentle and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Dunham has made a concerted effort to shield her sons from
those pressures. Dunham, a Fort Worth mother of two boys, ages 14
and 10, has encouraged them ``to express their feelings more, not
to `Be a man and buck up and tough it out.' I wanted them to be as
comfortable as possible talking about their feelings, because I
think that makes a healthy man.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 14-year-old still tells her everything, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including parents of boys, argue that ``masculine''
traits are inbred _ that their sons are naturally less inclined to
show emotions or to want to nurture dolls. But numerous gender
experts contend that most of those behaviors are learned and,
because of that, don't reflect boys' true nature.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where men and women are becoming equal partners in
the office and at home, these professionals say, the pressure on
boys to be ``manly'' won't serve them well. In fact, they argue,
it's already causing them trouble, especially in school.
</P>
<P>
   Boys receive lower grades than girls in every subject except
12th-grade physics, they drop out and are kicked out of school more
often, and they make up the overwhelming majority of special
education students, according to researchers. Four times as many
boys as girls commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of boys feel shortchanged,'' says Aaron Kipnis, a
clinical psychologist and author of ``Angry Young Men.'' ``There is
a narrow range of behavior that is celebrated in boys. (Either) you
make a lot of touchdowns, a lot of money, or you make good
grades.''
</P>
<P>
   While girls who don't fit in often turn to one another for
support, psychologists say, boys are more apt to turn inward and
feel marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of shame, a lot of sense of not being good
enough, tall enough, strong enough,'' Kipnis adds. ``We have half a
million boys taking steroids in America now ... so there is
something that's happening to the soul of our young men, to their
interior lives, and a lot of that has to do with our cultural
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is evidence that boys are feeling more pressure to
live up to stereotyped masculine ideals. Doctors are diagnosing
more eating disorders in male patients, and research suggests that
boys are much more preoccupied with their looks than they used to
be, notes Susan Bordo, a women's studies professor at the
University of Kentucky and author of ``The Male Body.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carol Ray's nearly 8-year-old son couldn't find a pair of
clean jeans one recent morning, Ray, who lives in Fort Worth,
suggested that he wear sweat pants. He refused. ``I look awful in
sweat pants,'' he protested.
</P>
<P>
   That may or may not be a reflection of peer pressure. But Bordo
says the stress boys feel shouldn't be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this generation is facing some elements that we can't
even imagine,'' she says. ``The degree to which very powerful
cultural images have an enormous grip on their psychic lives, the
conflicting messages sent to them ...''
</P>
<P>
   For the younger generation of males, Bordo says, conflict arises
between messages they receive about communicating openly and being
respectful of girls on the one hand _ through programs such as
sexual harassment awareness _ and the fear of being called a
``wimp'' on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Mark Kiselica agrees, but he cautions against
painting too gloomy a picture. ``Most kids are faring pretty
well,'' says Kiselica, an associate professor at the College of New
Jersey. ``We are not a nation of psychiatric patients or
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Boys will thrive if we give them the freedom to be themselves
and communicate with them on their level, Kiselica says. Finding a
group of like-minded parents may be just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't parent in a box,'' Edwards says. ``Instead of
thinking only about `what happens in my house,' we need to think
about `what's happening in my community.' ''

FROM HANUKKAH TO CHRISTMAS TO RAMADAN THROUGH TERIFFIC BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDY GUERRA-CLINE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some young believers call the holidays Christmas. Others,
Ramadan. Still others, Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, Muslims and Jews, December is a month rich in
religious traditions. Children's books offer families a chance to
read about their traditions as well as learn about other families
and what they hold most holy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Muslim community will begin a monthlong fast _
from dawn to dusk each day _ called Ramadan, or Ramadhan. Here are
two children's books that highlight the importance of a child's
first fast. (Generally, the Islamic faith requires only people in
their teens and older to participate, but children are encouraged
to fast as much as they are able during the holiday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Zaki's Ramadhan Fast'' by Ann P. El-Moslimany is a wonderful
introduction to the Islamic tradition for non-Muslim children in
grades K-3. The author, who is a teacher and grandmother, takes a
loving approach to a boy's first attempt at fasting. Zaki eats
breakfast with his family before sunrise, then goes back to bed.
When he wakes, the lingering smell of muffins makes his stomach
rumble. Will Zaki keep his fast?
</P>
<P>
   ``First Fast'' by Uthman Hutchinson is an ``easy reader'' for
children in grades 1 and 2. Jamaal is only 6, but he is determined
to fast like his older brother and sister. Fasting makes him
sleepy, and as he drifts in and out of the day, his elders lovingly
keep him moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   These paperback books, and a ``My Ramadhan Fun Pack'' filled
with activities and crafts, are available from Astrolabe Pictures,
(800) 392-7876, or at www.astrolabepictures.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish celebration of Hanukkah, an annual remembrance of
ancient miracles _ the triumph of the Maccabees and the light that
burned for eight days on a single day's supply of oil _ began at
sundown Dec. 3. In Jewish homes, each night another candle in the
family menorah is lighted, until all eight candles burn bright. Two
books explain the festival and traditions in very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins'' by Eric Kimmel (Holiday
House, $6.95 paperback) A band of fearsome goblins stops a village
from celebrating Hanukkah until a quick-witted and brave traveler
comes along. This Caldecott Honor Book owes as much of its power to
Trina Schart Hyman's dark illustrations as it does to Kimmel's
clever storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanukkah! A Three-Dimensional Celebration'' by Sara Freedland
(Candlewick Press, $18.99 hardback) Hanukkah traditions are
explained in detail in this gorgeous pop-up book that is more
family keepsake than simple storybook. It includes songs, a recipe
for latkes (potato pancakes) and a paper dreidl game that you
assemble yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Any of an assortment of Christmas stories would make fine
additions to a holiday bookshelf. The are books with spiritual
threads that bind families close with repeated readings year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is the Star'' by Joyce Dunbar (Voyager Books, $6
paperback) A beautiful retelling of the story of the Nativity that
one of my children realized is told in the gentle singsong manner
of ``The House That Jack Built.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Angel'' by Geraldine McCaughrean (Barnes &AMP; Noble Books,
$4.98 hardback) The charming story of Micah the shepherd boy and a
little angel, misfits both, and the gifts they receive from the
baby king.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Snowman'' by Phil Mendez (Scholastic, $5.99
paperback) This is the book my children asked for again and again.
Jacob Miller can't see the spirit of Christmas for the poverty
around him. A scrap of kente cloth provides the magic ... but will
Jacob believe in time to save his little brother Peewee?
</P>

ON NEW DVD FORMATS, THE SOUND OF GOOD THINGS TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are confusing times for anyone stepping into the world of
consumer electronics. The established order of things is being
shaken on every front. There is MP3, HDTV, digital cable and
satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   And now consumers can no longer take for granted even that
reliable bulwark of the audio world, the compact disc player. Two
new challengers are on the market, and all of the world's major
equipment manufacturers and record publishers are pushing to phase
out the compact disc and replace it with Super Audio CD or
DVD-Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Super Audio CD is a format backed by Sony and Philips, while
every other manufacturer is supporting DVD-Audio. Both new formats
use as a base a DVD, a disc that can hold seven times as much
information as a CD. With that extra capacity, both formats promise
higher-quality audio as well as multichannel sound and the
possibility of offering video clips, liner notes and other
information along with the music. But they record and store the
data in different formats, and Sony argues that its format gives
Super Audio CDs superior sound quality. DVD-Audio proponents say
their product can sound just as good.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's first Super Audio CD players are in the stores right now.
The flagship product has a price of $5,000. The company is also
selling a scaled-down model that costs $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic had expected to be the first major company to sell a
DVD-Audio player; the company had planned to send its first model
to stores late this month. But on Dec. 1, Panasonic announced that
the player would be delayed for about six months so the company
could incorporate a new copy-protection system into it.
</P>
<P>
   When some European hackers let it be known in October that they
had broken the copy-protection scheme used on DVD videodiscs, the
news rattled the record industry, prompting Panasonic's delay. At
least one other company, Pioneer, said it intended to proceed with
plans to begin selling DVD-Audio players in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic player is to cost $1,200 and will be marketed
under the Technics brand. Another model will be sold under the
Panasonic brand and will cost $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony and Panasonic products are both being heavily promoted,
primarily in magazine advertisements, and other companies will be
entering the market very soon. But right away, consumers should
know two things:
</P>
<P>
   First, these new products  &UR; do &LR;  sound quite a bit better than CD
players.
</P>
<P>
   And second, no one needs to rush out to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the industry agrees that the transition will take
many years. CD players and CDs will be manufactured for quite a
long time. And even when the CD player is eventually supplanted by
one or both of these new formats, the formats that win out will
still play CDs. So none of the recordings you buy today will be
made obsolete, unlike the situation when the industry moved from
vinyl records to compact discs in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment, these formats are most likely to appeal only
to those who must have the latest in audio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, buyers of Sony's Super Audio CD player can choose
from among roughly 40 Super Audio CDs, and that number is expected
to double in the next two or three months. Only a handful of
DVD-Audio discs from specialty manufacturers are on the market now,
though a great number of titles from the major record labels should
reach the stores early next year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, a Super Audio CD player will not play
DVD-Audio or DVD videodiscs, while a DVD-Audio player will play DVD
video discs but not Super Audio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   I reviewed both products and found, sure enough, that both offer
a notable leap forward in sound quality. But they are not equal.
And some features that will be available on later-generation
players are not available on these.
</P>
<P>
   Sony was first to deliver a Super Audio CD player to be reviewed
for this article. Company executives see high-end audiophiles as
the most likely customers, so they are quite concerned about
reviews. As a result, Sony sent three people to install the player.
And, apparently not satisfied with my speakers, they brought along
a pair of their own that cost $16,000. The team spent about three
hours setting everything up.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sony people had left, I listened at first with their
model SS-M9ED speakers, then with my own, Infinity Composition
Preludes. In both cases, the difference between conventional CDs
and Super Audio CDs was like the difference between sparkling cider
and Piper Heidseck champagne. Once you hear a Super Audio CD, you
will never want to go back. The sound was richer and warmer. It
seemed so much more real, as if a veil had been lifted, that it
brought spontaneous smiles to several listeners' faces. One
longstanding complaint about CDs is that they add a harsh edge to
strings, voices, piano. With the new format, that harsh edge was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sony lent me two dozen discs, including a few recordings that
were also available on CD. Playing both simultaneously, and
switching back and forth between the two, the CD sounded muddy,
even primitive. Everyone who listened to this player over several
weeks, even those with just a casual interest in audio, agreed:
This new format is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Panasonic delivered the first DVD-Audio
player, a preproduction model of the Technics player. It arrived
via United Parcel Service, unaccompanied by a technical team.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Records, a small label in Los Angeles that has been
producing DVD-Audio discs for more than a year, provided eight of
them, along with several CD versions of the same recordings. But
since I had no common recordings in both Super Audio CD and
DVD-Audio format, I was unable to do a direct comparison. In the
end, however, it wasn't really necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, there was a clear difference, though it was much
subtler. Some casual listeners could not hear it. With DVD-Audio,
the music sounded warmer, less constrained. But it still held a bit
of a harsh edge on some instruments and did not offer the absolute
clarity and realism that came through on Super Audio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio discs will come in several flavors, some offering
higher resolution than others. And the highest-resolution discs are
not yet being made. They may compete more effectively with Super
Audio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   For now the question consumers might ask is whether this is the
right time to buy one of these new formats. Certainly, for the
die-hard early adopter who wants the best new thing right away,
Sony's new product _ and perhaps the DVD-Audio player, if the
higher-resolution discs do in fact sound better _ perform exactly
as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are several good reasons to wait. For one, the Sony
player offers only stereo. Later versions will offer the choice of
stereo or multichannel audio, which is the clear direction the
music industry is taking.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic player is already multichannel. It can play stereo
discs or those with six channels of surround sound. But to play
multichannel music, a consumer must have a receiver or
pre-amplifier that has a six-channel input _ six separate plugs.
Only a few new receivers offer that option.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, one digital connection will carry all six channels,
as it does now on DVD video players. (Once the copy-protection
problem has been resolved, a digital output will be feasible.
Panasonic has not said whether the players to be sold in six months
will offer that, but six months is not generally enough time for a
manufacturer to modify a major product.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, right now consumers must choose between Super Audio
CD and DVD-Audio. But two manufacturers, Philips and Pioneer, have
already announced plans to begin selling players next year that
will play both formats. Pioneer's player will be on sale in the
spring for $4,000. Others later in the year are certain to be less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called universal decks will offer a choice of
two-channel or multichannel audio. By then, they should be able to
provide one-jack digital outputs that will work with most modern
receivers and pre-amplifiers. And they will play everything: Super
Audio CD's, DVD-Audio discs, DVD-videodiscs and CDs. By then a much
larger library of music in both formats will be in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   So the greater part of wisdom seems to argue for waiting.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Nuovo, chief designer at Nokia, sits in his spacious
office in Calabasas, Calif., surrounded by several generations of
cell phones he has had a hand in creating, and ponders the
serendipitous turns in his career that led to a full-time fixation
on mobile communications.
</P>
<P>
   The first came one day just before Christmas more than a decade
ago, when Nuovo was a young industrial designer at Designworks/USA,
a consulting firm near Los Angeles. A call came from an executive
at nearby Nokia who was looking for design help with a new line of
mobile phones. Nuovo happened to be the only one in the office, so
he took the call.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nuovo, who is 38, is credited with helping Nokia (pronounced
NO-kee-ah) do for cell phones what Swatch did for watches. His idea
_ turning cell phones into fashion statements _ has been hugely
successful. This year, said Brian Modoff, an analyst with Deutsche
Banc Alex Brown, almost one in every three phones sold worldwide
was made by Nokia, which has blended its fashionable image with a
reputation for making sturdy phones that are easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   The most ubiquitous of Nuovo's products are the 5100 and 6100
Series phones. One secret of the phones' success is their ability
to change thks. An owner can swap faceplates to make a phone
match a shade of nail polish. It is not unusual for someone to buy
a new Nokia phone along with four or five different covers. Nuovo,
himself a fashion hound, considers a cell phone to be as visible an
accessory as his Milus wristwatch.
</P>
<P>
   The newest rage is the 8210, the smallest digital phone on the
market in Europe. It was introduced in October in Paris, not at a
consumer electronics conference but at a fashion show for the
designer Kenzo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nokia is based in Helsinki, Finland, and has nine major
offices around the world with design components, the company's
principal design center is the one tucked into a bland office park
in Calabasas, about an hour northwest of downtown Los Angeles. That
fact has everything to do with Nuovo, a native Californian who
preferred not to uproot his family to move to Finland when he went
to work for Nokia full time in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the center, which has no sign outside, is behind locked
doors, with the exception of a modest reception area, a conference
room and Nuovo's office. Nuovo said the exact number of designers
who work with him in Calabasas was a secret but that it was
``substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered about Nuovo's office are objects whose design he
admires: several scale models of luxury cars, a soap dish of
sculpted aluminum, and interesting springs, bottle openers and
spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent is a display of 75 or so expensive and unusual
pens, all of them miniature sculptures made of aluminum, titanium,
wood or cork, which Nuovo picked up in his travels through Europe
and Asia. Mobile phones, Nuovo said, are not far removed from what
he finds beautiful in pens. Pens are the ultimate handheld device.
They are intuitively easy to use, and everyone has a different
preference for shape, color and feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want it to be comfortable and in a sense, you want it to
tickle the right nerve,'' he said. ``It all adds up to an emotional
and physical attachment to the device. If you look at our phones,
you'll see a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuovo likens the design process to playing in a band. Designing
a product, he said, requires consistent communication among the
mechanical and electrical engineers, the manufacturing team and
other designers. ``You're only as good as the worst guy in the
band,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nuovo's boss, Yrjo Neuvo, Nokia's senior vice president for
product creation, said one of Nuovo's greatest talents _ unusual
for an artist _ was his ability to guide teams of designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives direction, and gives the final touch, but he's also
guiding the whole team,'' Neuvo said.
</P>
<P>
   Nuovo's analogy to music was no accident. By age 11, Nuovo, who
bears a striking resemblance to both Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman
(he has been mistaken for Hoffman on the streets of Beverly Hills
and Pacino in a bar in Helsinki), was a professional drummer. While
growing up in Monterey, Calif., he played jazz and jazz fusion in
trios and big bands. ``My parents had to drive me to the gigs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But art always beckoned. In 1983 he enrolled at the Art Center
College of Design in Pasadena, which is famous for turning out some
of the world's most successful industrial designers.
</P>
<P>
   While still a student, Nuovo caught the eye of Chuck Pelly,
chief executive of Designworks/USA, now a subsidiary of BMW, so
Pelly put him to work designing patio furniture and automobile
interiors. ``We watch key students all around the world,'' Pelly
said. ``Every few years you notice one that has a combination of
high learning skills, a natural business mind and is a very good
designer. He was clearly destined to grow like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the lucky phone call from Nokia, Nuovo has had timing
work for him in other ways. His rise at Nokia, once a manufacturing
conglomerate known for rubber boots and toilet paper, coincided
with the company's gradual decision to focus almost exclusively on
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that move, the analog network in Europe was largely
displaced by a digital system called GSM. Nokia says it was the
first to market a GSM phone, designed by Nuovo, in 1992. When the
United States started shifting to digital in the late 1990s, Nokia
was ready with its 2100 Series, among the best-selling digital
phones at the time. While Motorola's light, pocketable cell phones
had been popular through the mid-1990s, the company was caught
short without a digital product.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of two analog phones with color faceplates
in the early 1990s, Nuovo and others at Nokia began presenting
phones as fashion accessories. In 1997 came the 5100 and 6100
digital phones. Nuovo was convinced that they would be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those phones look quite ordinary. They are what
designers call a monoblock form, as opposed to a flip phone like
the StarTac. They are small, light and sturdy. ``There are no
complex moving parts,'' Nuovo said, ``and you feel right away that
this is a solid product and very comfortable in the hand. We were
after a very robust, simple form.'' Another important ingredient,
he said, has been the phone's large screen, which lent itself
immediately to data services, like text messaging and caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the question of style. Nuovo attributes much of the
success of the 5100 series to the phone's interchangeable
faceplates (the 5100 faceplates pop off; those for the 6100 require
a screwdriver), something he and others at Nokia championed for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept was about personalization,'' he said.
``People being able to make it their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The same holds for the relatively new 8860, a shiny conversation
piece of a phone that could be mistaken for a cigarette lighter.
Nuovo got the inspiration for the phone's chrome exterior from
other high-end accessories, like a chrome flask, a sterling silver
address book not much thicker than a cassette tape, a snuffbox, a
cigarette case, a woman's compact and a Zippo ashtray he found in
Japan. In Europe, the 8860 is nicknamed the Zippo phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nuovo is unapologetic about the oily fingerprints that so easily
ruin the gleam of the 8860 ($799). In fact, he said, it has
engendered a new form of ``completely acceptable'' social behavior.
He demonstrated by rubbing his heavily smudged phone on his
sternum, his silk Jhane Barnes shirt serving as a buffing cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing a lot of people doing this,'' he said, then held
up the polished phone. ``See? Just like new.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The new 8200 series, introduced at the Kenzo show, takes the
fashion statement still further. The three-ounce 8210 phone has six
easily interchangeable faceplates.
</P>
<P>
   But that's already yesterday's news. Like any good designer,
Nuovo said, he lives five years out. To demonstrate, he reached
into his briefcase and pulled out a pair of prototypes. Impossibly
thin and predictably futuristic, these two concept phones have
everything: built-in cameras, fully readable Web pages, personal
organizers and a large dose of snazz.
</P>
<P>
   By the time those phones, or phones like them, are on the
market, Nuovo may well have left the world of communications
fashion. ``My dream is to someday have a jazz club in Monterey and
play _ that's something I passionately want to do,'' he said,
striking a restless note. ``The ultimate dream is to stay
creative.''

HOW, WHEN, WHY AND TO WHOM YOU SHOULD SEND HOLIDAY CARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month, I enter the Real World. I've been making this
transition since I graduated from college in the spring, slowly
starting to participate in activities reserved for Real People who
have Jobs and Established Lives. You know: going to bed at night,
eating meals beyond the microwavable, things like that.
</P>
<P>
   But in December, the metamorphosis becomes complete: In
December, Real People send holiday cards to their Real People
friends. And because this is my first December in years that's free
of the sleepy haze brought on by research papers and final exams, I
have no excuse. The Real People I know are expecting cards. And I'd
better send them.
</P>
<P>
   The first steps were easy. I chose my cards and updated the
address list. But then confusion set in. I know there are countless
ways to offend in this annual card exchange. An ill-timed or
ill-worded holiday card is an annoyance. I don't want to make my
Real World debut as an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   So I consulted the experts. I called Hilka Klinkenberg,
etiquette expert, author, founder and owner of Etiquette
International, a business etiquette firm based in New York City.
Klinkenberg answered my questions. All of them. Politely. She
clearly did not consider me an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   As an additional caution, I turned to Miss Manners herself,
Judith Martin. Her newest book, ``Miss Manners' Guide to Domestic
Tranquility,'' devotes an entire section to this complicated topic.
</P>
<P>
   I researched, I took notes; in my quest to find etiquette
truths, I entered a Real World December haze. Here's what I found.
</P>
<P>
   TIMING
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I thought: I've received cards as late as the middle
of January. What's a month or two? If I get busy this month, I'll
just address them while the Super Bowl's on. It's the thought that
counts, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, Klinkenberg says. ``If the greetings get there after the
event, it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you're late, you offend. You become an
annoyance. But there's an option. If your timing is off,
Klinkenberg suggests sending New Year's cards instead. ``You can
send those pretty well through January,'' she says. I guess saving
it all as halftime entertainment during the big game is pretty much
out of the picture then.
</P>
<P>
   THE PERSONAL TOUCH
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I thought: To be more efficient, I'll get my name
stamped onto the cards. I won't have to sign each and every card,
and my name will undoubtedly be more legible.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again, Klinkenberg says. The stamped card is quite
impersonal _ and if you send an impersonal card, you defeat the
purpose of sending a card at all.
</P>
<P>
   Klinkenberg says her edict applies to the envelope, too.
Adhesive labels are another no-no. Yes, they're easier to read, but
Klinkenberg insists that you shouldn't use mailing labels under any
circumstances _ ``It looks like you're sending out a mass
mailing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   THE DREADED NEWSLETTER
</P>
<P>
   Again, my thoughts: The newsletter rocks. I'll write a little
something about my accomplishments this year (going to bed at
night, eating those not-from-the microwave meals and all) and copy
it at the nearest copy center. Many families include the kids' SAT
scores in their mass-produced letters, but because I don't have
kids, I'll have to report my own score. And because I don't have
pets, perhaps I can improvise with an update on the pigeons that
keep eating the plants on my patio. People love that stuff, right?
</P>
<P>
   Welll, actually, some of them do. Martin and Klinkenberg both
say holiday news updates aren't inherently evil. Done correctly,
they're welcomed. It's the smug and rambling list of family
accomplishments that offends and annoys.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Manners reminds readers to consider the recipient's level
of interest. Some people just like to know they are remembered, she
says, so a brief greeting is more appropriate. Others really want
to hear family news, but be careful _ ``It is unlikely ... that
anyone's interests extend to three pages of single-spaced purple
mimeographing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Klinkenberg says newsletters aren't the best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really had my druthers, I'd have people write a personal
letter,'' she says. ``It really becomes special.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says she understands time constraints. And it doesn't
take too much time or effort to personalize a newsletter,
Klinkenberg says _ just add a personal note at the letter's
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personalize that first paragraph,'' she advises. ``Suddenly,
it makes the letter special.''
</P>
<P>
   But even this has its pitfalls. Klinkenberg said she recently
received an unfortunate version of the personalized newsletter. An
economical friend sent out letters that were indeed personalized _
but for five people at a time. That's right, the first five
paragraphs were ``individual'' greetings to five different people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who the other people were,'' Klinkenberg says,
but she had to read through the writer's personal messages to them.
``It makes you feel like you're spying on someone else's life.''
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   A holiday greeting is a holiday greeting, methinks. So everyone
I know is going to receive a religious card of my choosing, whether
they observe Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or the end of TV sweeps.
It's all the same thing, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the right way to think, the experts say _ although
lots of people do it. If you want to send a religious card, but
you're not sure if the recipient shares the same beliefs, err on
the side of sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in doubt, don't send religious cards, Klinkenberg
says. And be careful, because even if a card isn't overtly
religious, it can still scream out your religious take on the
holidays. You're better off with a generic type of card, she says _
a winter scene or a peace dove. Snow and birds never offended
anyone. That we know of.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL ETIQUETTE
</P>
<P>
   I'm a Net-savvy girl. My friends will receive e-mail containing
a URL, which they can click on to find a personal greeting complete
with dancing Santas and cheesy music. Maybe this is a good
alternative, I begin to think.
</P>
<P>
   In this world of technophiles, could e-mailed holiday greetings
possibly be rude? Well, they're not as rude as they are
ineffective, according to Klinkenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your greeting will be forgotten as soon as it arrives,'' she
says. ``The moment someone clicks out of their e-mail, the greeting
is forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail card will only affect the visual sense, she says,
while a real card affects its recipient on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE LIST ENDS
</P>
<P>
   I realize, of course, that the holiday card relationships I
establish this year are likely to continue for the rest of my life.
When I'm 80, I'll still be getting cards that say ``Happy Holidays
from Traci and David!'' or ``Merry Christmas from Jenni and Mark!''
And I, of course, will be obligated to reciprocate, wishing I could
just remember how or when I knew them.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say Klinkenberg and Martin. You shouldn't have to send
cards to people you no longer know or keep in touch with, and they
shouldn't have to send cards to you. It's a meaningless exchange.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you gracefully drop someone from your list? ``You
don't send them a card,'' Klinkenberg says.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am putting up a new fence by installing wood posts set in a
concrete footing.
</P>
<P>
   I did this years ago in my old house but found that after a
number of years some of the posts had loosened slightly and become
a little wobbly _ apparently because the wood had shrunk and was no
longer securely anchored inside the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   How can I anchor my new fence posts _ so they won't work loose
again _ without doing a lot of extra work?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a number of ways to reinforce and steady fence
posts that are set into a concrete footing, but one of the simplest
and least expensive methods is the one shown here.
</P>
<P>
   Before inserting the posts in their holes, drive a series of
heavy galvanized nails (4- to 6-inch size) with large heads about
half way into the underground portion of the wood post so that they
stick out on all sides as indicated.
</P>
<P>
   After inserting each post into its hole, and while holding the
post upright, pour the concrete into the hole. The embedded nails
will provide a firm gripping surface for the concrete even if the
wood shrinks slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The house we bought several years ago has a problem that is
quite annoying. Many of the wood floors seem to creak or squeak
when walked upon, upstairs as well as downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   I am not handy, nor am I physically able to do much work around
the house, so I want to call in a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think he will be able to fix this without major
construction and expense?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any experienced carpenter should be able to pinpoint the
source of the problem, but it is impossible to say how much work or
expense will be required to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Most squeaking is caused by loose floor boards or subflooring
that has not been nailed or screwed down properly, but it's also
possible that the creaking is caused by other structural problems,
such as floor boards that have swelled or buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Try to get an estimate from your carpenter before you agree to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a ceiling lighting fixture that we would like to
replace with a combination ceiling fan-and-light fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Is this something I can do myself?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot depends on the type of ceiling outlet box that is
already installed for your existing ceiling light.
</P>
<P>
   A fan weighs considerably more than a simple lighting fixture,
so the ceiling box must be properly braced and mounted to support
this weight.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot do this yourself (directions are supplied by most
dealers and manufacturers) then you may find it advisable to call
in a professional electrician to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   The electrician may also be needed if you are not able to do the
necessary wiring _ but this will depend on your ability to follow
the directions supplied with all such units.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My apartment is in a 70-year-old building that has walls of
plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently these walls were all covered with canvas some years
ago and in some places this canvas has started to pull away from
the wall along the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Should I cut away and peel these loose areas off, or is it
advisable to simply try and paste these sections back with some
kind of adhesive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lining old plaster walls with canvas was a common practice
years ago when the plaster had many cracks or loose areas.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas reinforced the plaster and covered up the cracks to
create a smooth new surface that could be painted or papered.
</P>
<P>
   I would, therefore, not advise peeling any of this canvas off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead paste the loosened sections back down with a vinyl
adhesive that is sold for this purpose in all paint stores.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``SECURING WOOD POSTS IN CONCRETE'' goes

</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Heavy nails driven half way into base of wood post on
all sides will help prevent future loosening.

BRIGHTENING OLD SNAPSHOTS WITH PHOTOGENETICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (Eds: A circuits article last Thursday that reviewed photo editing
programs inaccurately described the capabilities of one program,
Photogenetics, because an incomplete version of the software was
provided by the company, the Q-Research Corp. This is a review of
the full program. )

<P>
   Photogenetics is a highly rudimentary tool for altering
photographs. It may appeal to people who do not want to spend time
learning how to use more sophisticated programs like Photoshop LE
from Adobe or Corel Photopaint. Activating the program, which
retails for $39.95, requires calling up a registration form and
entering a code.
</P>
<P>
   The program's chief feature is a system that improves the color
of faded photographs. It works by offering two views of a photo,
side-by-side, then applying a slight color change to one of them.
The user then rates the improvement over the other photo on a
sliding scale from ``no improvement'' to ``much better.'' After
four comparisons, it institutes a change in the first photo, and
the process continues until the viewer is satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional materials says it can fix photos in two minutes,
but with some badly aged pictures, it took far more time _ about 60
tries worth over at least 10 minutes. And although the result was
much improved over the initial photo, a side-by-side comparison
with the same photograph modified using other software showed that
Photogenetics had produced less improvement in more time.
</P>
<P>
   The cropping feature worked as well as those of other programs,
but the red eye feature did not. It offers a virtual pencil which
is used to draw over the orange glow of red eye. The best that
could be managed, however, was a slight grey-green tinting of the
orange glow.
</P>
<P>
   The program did not offer any way to cut and paste images to
create photo collages, as other programs do. Nor did it offer tools
to repair cracks and spots in photos. The program also could not
open all kinds of image files, rejecting those in TIFF format.
</P>
<P>
   And it was difficult to determine what some features were. There
was no feature labeled ``convert to black and white,'' but clicking
on ``gray 2 blue-filter'' appeared to accomplish the task.
</P>
<P>
   There were other features that produced 1960s-style pop art
images by radically altering the colors of a photograph, and
another that produced a negative image. There was also a nice
``dewarp'' feature that compensates for the distortion a wide angle
lens adds to a photo.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers more sophisticated versions of its color
modification program that will modify a single color in a
photograph, for an additional $29.95.

   A strong jet stream flow from the Pacific will continue to
direct low pressure systems across the nation while keeping Arctic
air locked in northern Canada. One low pressure zone will promote
inclement weather from the southern Plains to the Ohio Valley on
Thursday while a new disturbance sweeps into the West Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will fall near the track of a low pressure center as it
moves from northern Texas early Thursday to the central Mississippi
Valley on Thursday night. A narrow band of snow will occur at the
fringe of the rain area from the northern panhandle of Texas to
central Kansas. The precipitation will end quickly in northern
Texas and western Oklahoma as drier air arrives from the west.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will occur in the humid air from eastern parts of Texas
and Oklahoma to the southern Mississippi Valley. A band of potent
thunderstorms will develop Thursday afternoon as a vigorous jet
stream disturbance moves from the eastern Red River Valley into
Arkansas. Shifting winds will impart rotation to some of the
thunderstorms, which may spawn a few tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be plentiful along the the East Coast as strong
high pressure moves offshore. Some high clouds will dim the sun at
times over the Northeast, but, temperatures will be far above the
seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a cold front will produce rain from northern
California to the Pacific Northwest. Snow will fall in the Cascades
and Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: PERENNIAL STORMS
</P>
<P>
   A bout with high winds accompanied by rain and snow in coastal
southeastern Alaska on Wednesday signaled an active phase in the
life of one of this hemisphere's perennial storms. The Aleutian
low, named for its proximity to the Alaskan archipelago, appears on
weather maps for most of the year. Gales that develop off of the
east coast of Asia are drawn toward the large temperature contrasts
in the Aleutians that result as polar winds meet the warmer waters
of the Pacific. In the Atlantic, surges of frigid air from
Greenland provide energy for a similar atmospheric whirlpool, the
Icelandic low.

AN EARLY CHRONICLER OF THE INTERNET TALKS ABOUT A DECADE OF
GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN C. MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Krol was one of the first chroniclers of the Internet. He
helped develop the Frequently Asked Questions format with ``The
Hitchhikers Guide to the Internet'' posted on the Net in 1987. His
1992 book, ``The Whole Internet User's Guide &AMP; Catalog'' (O'Reilly
&AMP; Associates), was considered the bible for the first generation of
Net users. He has finally written a sequel with Kiersten
Conner-Sax, ``The Whole Internet User's Guide: The Next
Generation'' (O'Reilly &AMP; Associates). Krol is an assistant director
of computing and communications at the University of Illinois in
Urbana, where Mosaic, the first graphical Web browser, was
developed. In an interview over the Internet, he considers the past
decade of being online.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the most significant change in the Internet since you
first started using it?
</P>
<P>
   A. The change from being primarily a collaborative interpersonal
tool to an information service. The major use today is to gather
information from databases on the Web. You get a new prescription,
you run to the Web to read the package insert. You want to know if
IBM went up or down today, you run to the Web. You need a new coat;
you browse through online catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you think the Net would explode the way it has?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really. I expected conventional explosives, and it has
been the H-bomb. I expected it to be a stodgier facility which
would be used by everyone professionally and for some personal
information gathering, but not as much of the amusement and
recreational use as there is now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the negatives about Net usage today compared with 10
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can think of two offhand. The first is spam ... The second
issue is the quest for big bucks ... The view is if your site is
glitzier than your competitors (or your ad is) more people will
visit (or notice). The problem is that in 90 percent of the pages
out there the glitz adds nothing to the content and only serves to
slow the delivery down and force the download of all kinds of
plug-in extensions to the browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What has disappeared from the Net that you would like back?
</P>
<P>
   A. The sense of community and decorum. I had always hoped that
people would be refreshed that the online community was so much
more stable than the real world and it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   But, I think when people are plucking down their own money for a
56kb dialup, they think they have bought 56kb of bandwidth anywhere
in the world to waste any way they wish. They feel they have the
right to be uncivil.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I liked a cybervillage and what we have now is
cybercity, with all the problems of the city.

CHRISTMAS TREES (NOT FOR DOWNLOADING) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I am a snob about Christmas trees, blame my mother. When I
was small, she would march through the tree lot, suspiciously
searching for crooked trunks, missing branches and needle loss. In
her quest to acquire the biggest, fullest, freshest Scotch pine,
she was not above examining candidates already reserved for other
customers.
</P>
<P>
   One year she fell in love with a particularly graceful specimen
slated for the nuns at a nearby convent. She bribed the lot owner
$10 to snip off the ``reserved'' tag.
</P>
<P>
   All those trees were competing against a memory: the Christmas
tree of 1945, when my mother was 4 years old. The war had ended,
but tree lights were still scarce, at least in the secluded hills
and hollows of eastern Kentucky, where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   So my grandfather, a mechanic, brought home taillights,
headlights and reflector lamps from the shop and attached them to
the branches. The next morning a new doll sat beneath, bathed in an
eerie red and orange glow. ``Prettiest tree we ever had,'' she
insists.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because I am my mother's daughter, I believe a proper
Christmas tree is six and a half feet tall and too bushy to fit
anywhere except right in front of the big picture window. It is
lighted by strings of old-fashioned, oversize colored bulbs that
give off an eerie glow (probably because half their paint has been
scratched off over the years). Not to be picky, but the foil angel
suspended in a glass ball should hang 6 inches above the miniature
creche in a beaded eggshell.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine, then, that I was pretty nervous about buying a
Christmas tree over the Internet. First I telephoned four purveyors
of online trees _ www.xmas-trees.com, www.freshchristmastrees.com,
www.echristmastrees.com and
www.evermontproducts.com/eVermontChristmastrees/index.html _ to
grill, er, ask a few questions about how they could possibly
shoulder the responsibility of choosing the right tree, much less
pack and ship such a fragile item to my house within three to five
business days via United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   All four assured me they would handpick only the finest tree,
painstakingly pack it in a long cardboard box and guarantee a
replacement if I was not satisfied. I could order ahead and specify
a delivery date, or, if I procrastinated, I could pay extra for
speedier delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Cormier, who operates VermontProducts.com, vouched for the
packing process. ``I had one in a box for five days,'' she said.
``It looked like a cube at first. Within an hour, it regained its
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove her point, Ms. Cormier mailed a 6-and-a-half-foot
balsam fir to me. It arrived within three days and, yes, regained
its shape within three hours. The only problem was that it was a
fir.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know some people want a fir, and all four online tree
sellers offer them in heights from 3 feet to 7 feet and at prices
from $59.95 to $107.95 including shipping. And I don't even mind
that some people like a fir, even if Scotch pines _ my family's
choice _ are so obviously more beautiful and festive.
</P>
<P>
   Why, there even used to be a fir family on my block. Of course,
this family also believed in ``theme'' tree decorations. One year,
the decorations consisted of clumps of purple balls that looked
like gigantic bunches of fever-dream grapes.
</P>
<P>
   To get a Scotch pine, I had to narrow my choice to
Xmas-trees.com, a Web site operated by Guy Frederick, who grows
trees on a farm near Cadillac, Mich., that once belonged to his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain freshness, Frederick recommended unpacking the tree
right away, sawing one-half inch off the bottom of the trunk and
sticking it into water. ``You don't want problems with needle
retention,'' he warned. As if I could forget the year my father
burned out the motor on the vacuum cleaner while trying to suck
unretained needles out of the trunk of the car.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered, specifying a height of five and a half feet to six
and a half feet, which costs $50, including shipping.
</P>
<P>
   I requested that the tree be delivered on Dec. 3. That
afternoon, my daughters sat in the big picture window, waiting for
the UPS truck and bickering over whose year it was to hang the
carved wooden camel with the jeweled saddle.
</P>
<P>
   By suppertime, they gave up. But then, right after we lighted
the Hanukkah candles (yes, we celebrate both), the tree arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like a cube. But by the next morning, the tree had
opened into a beautiful cone shape. It had, however, one problem.
It was not bushy. It was so slender and elegant that it would have
looked better in designer clothing than in the suddenly ridiculous
old-fashioned lights.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Frederick, who said I should have noted my bushiness
preference on the order form's Comments section. ``People specify
all kinds of things _ down to the inch _ and we stand there in the
barn holding the order form while we pick one out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I phoned my mother. After ascertaining that the tree had a
strong, high branch on which to hang the glitter-frosted Mad Hatter
ornament, she suggested _ somewhat to my horror _ that I change the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   A thinner tree could work if I put aside the traditional
fat-bulb lights with a string of tiny white lights, which my mother
always called ``Italian lights'' because she first saw them in a
spaghetti restaurant in the 1960s. ``Substitute Italians for
standards,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was remarkable. ``Prettiest tree ever,'' my
oldest daughter said. &QL;

TOMMI PARZINGER: A VOGUE MODERNIST   IN A ROGUE MARKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Calif.)  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the well-dressed men about town in New York in
the 1950s was Tommi Parzinger, who designed furnishings for
fashionable decorators like Billy Baldwin and for private clients
like Marilyn Monroe (or Mrs. Miller, as she called herself in
making her evening appointments) and branches of the Ford, DuPont
and Mellon families.
</P>
<P>
   Parzinger was also a painter. An exhibition of 25 of his oil
paintings went on view Wednesday for the first time, along with his
furnishings, at Palumbo, a modern design gallery at 972 Lexington
Avenue through Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   A design contemporary of T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings and Paul Laszlo,
Parzinger was born in Germany in 1903. He moved to New York,
opening for business in 1939. His last showroom, on East 57th
Street, closed shortly after his death in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Parzinger's furnishings are highly prized and heavily
collected as examples of a more idiosyncratic, rarefied midcentury
design _ an elegant aside to the Eameses, Knolls and Nelsons of the
period _ that the market calls ``high-style modernism.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced as custom studio pieces or expensive small factory
items, Parzinger's were cosmopolitan-looking designs, involving
costly, craft-intensive materials and processes like brass work and
lacquer _ cabinetry in the simple, antimachinist idiom of the
Wiener Werkstatte.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Palumbo, the gallery's owner, has become something of a
specialist in Parzinger's career, selling his vintage pieces. In
association with Donald Cameron, who worked with the furniture
designer for 32 years and who inherited the company, Parzinger
Originals, Ms. Palumbo recently began manufacturing reproductions
of Parzinger's designs. They are based on original working
drawings. The 25-piece line, priced from $2,200 to $20,000,
continues to expand; dinnerware is next.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron produced most of the designs during Parzinger's last 15
years, as the master devoted himself to his Expressionistic
painting, which bears no resemblance to his crisp furniture forms.
</P>
<P>
   The collecting market for Parzinger and the reappearance of
Cameron has raised an interesting point about high-style modernism
and its audience. With its chic entrance into the arena of
antiques, vintage modernism must now face a mature collecting
market's central issue: that of authenticity. Verification becomes
complicated with boutique or decorator operations like Parzinger's.
His custom work was not consistently labeled. Through licensing
agreements, designs were sold by other companies under his name, in
some cases unauthorized by Parzinger.
</P>
<P>
   Without corporate archives like Herman Miller's or documented
competitions like the Museum of Modern Art's that record and verify
its genesis, a design has no secure substantiation when it isn't
signed, aside from impeccable provenance.
</P>
<P>
   At galleries and auction houses, the field of high-style
modernism is clouded by so-called gray goods: great lines,
questionable lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's Los Angeles, in its ``Innovators of 20th Century
Style'' auction on Sept. 15, put up for sale 12 lots described as
Parzinger's designs. Cameron, unknown to Christie's, said that
three were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, I thought, `This is crazy; it's just bad
design,''' he said, when a friend brought the catalog to his
attention. Cameron telephoned Christie's in New York. Jason Stein,
a decorative arts specialist at Christie's Los Angeles, called him
to ask if the lots could be described as ``in the style of'' Tommi
Parzinger. ``I said, `No, the designs are too ugly,''' Cameron
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's reattributed one contested lot, which failed to sell,
as ``in the style of'' in a sales announcement. Another, a floor
lamp, sold as a Tommi Parzinger design for $3,450.
</P>
<P>
   A Christie's spokeswoman, Andree Corroon, said the lot was
reviewed by internal and external experts. The auction house
remained confident that the attribution was correct.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid confusion over Tommi Parzinger furnishings being
produced now, Ms. Palumbo is branding her pieces
``Parzinger/Cameron Originals at Palumbo.''

ATHLETICS LEADER PLANS TO KEEP TEAM IN OAKLAND FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 By MATTHEW YI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ A day after a local investment group decided
to give up its efforts to purchase the Oakland Athletics, a team
official said he expected the franchise to remain in the East Bay
for at least the near future.
</P>
<P>
   A's President Mike Crowley on Tuesday said a new deal is in the
making with city and county officials to keep the team in Oakland
beyond 2001, when the team's current owners can end their lease
with the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that something would come together,'' Crowley
said. ``The A's will be here for a while, that's for sure. We're
planning for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the question remained Tuesday at what price the team
would be asked to stay _ and whether it will cost taxpayers any
money.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Crowley nor Oakland City Council President Ignacio De La
Fuente would confirm or deny reports that the team would stay
through 2004 in exchange for a cash contribution toward marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Dolich, the former A's executive who headed the local group
seeking to buy the team from current owners Ken Hofmann and Steve
Schott, said the lease already is a good deal for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A's already have one of the handsomest stadium lease deals
in baseball. That was a major point of attraction for our quest for
ownership,'' Dolich said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the current lease, which expires in 2001, the team
gets all proceeds from parking, concessions and pays no rent.
</P>
<P>
   An offer to give cash to help pay for marketing the team would
not only be more icing on the cake for the franchise, but an
unusual one, Dolich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been other public-private partnerships in sports
when it comes to generating more revenue through ticket sales or
corporate sponsorships ... but if it ultimately comes to a check
being written, that would be a little different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hofmann and Schott announced more than a year ago that they
would exercise their right to end the lease in 2001, some Oakland
and Alameda County officials believed a sale to new, local owners
was the only way to keep the A's here.
</P>
<P>
   They thought they had found those owners in a group led by
Dolich. But three months ago major league baseball owners refused
to approve the Dolich group's $122.4 million purchase, saying the
league must first study the viability of small market teams such as
the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Dolich announced that he and his investors,
including Men's Warehouse founder George Zimmer and Modesto
supermarket magnate Bob Piccinini, had withdrawn their $12 million
deposit, effectively giving up their pursuit to buy the team.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Keeping professional sports teams in Oakland has been a
contentious issue in recent years with lawsuits being filed between
the Joint Powers Authority _ represented by city and county
officials _ and the Golden State Warriors pro basketball team, the
Oakland Raiders football team and the A's.
</P>
<P>
   The JPA earlier charged that the Warriors never paid the team's
share of the costs to renovate the new sports arena operated by the
JPA. Two months ago, an arbitrator ruled in favor of the city and
county, ordering the Warriors to pay $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Raiders, team owner Al Davis has been arguing that
the current lease _ set to last until 2011 _ is not valid because
city and county officials falsely promised sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   That trial is pending.
</P>
<P>
   When the Raiders were wooed from Los Angeles to Oakland, the A's
were upset, mainly because the JPA agreed to eliminate some
bleacher seats to make room for luxury boxes for the football team.
</P>
<P>
   Even without such disputes, it is difficult to keep professional
sports teams because of the intense competition between cities,
Dolich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, the JPA has basically done a good job in
keeping these teams here,'' he said. ``Yes, it's been contentious.
Yes, there's been a lot of money floating around here. But if you
look at other cities spending money on new stadiums, we're better
than OK to have three sports franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Fuente agreed, criticizing speculations that Oakland is
not a big enough market to keep the A's when the San Francisco
Giants are just across the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Fuente would have preferred to see the Dolich
group become the new A's owners, he said he's excited at the
prospects the team will remain in Oakland at least until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiations are pretty much done. We just need to get the
final approval from both sides,'' De La Fuente said.

<P>
   The old wallpaper roller, inherited from my father, was the
first tool I treasured. Its wooden handle was worn, and when I
wrapped my hand around it, it was as comforting as a wooden shift
knob on a '66 Camaro. Besides its patinated handle, it had a curved
head of orange Bakelite, which was gentle in delicate corners _ it
didn't rip the paper the way the new hard and heartless plastic
ones do.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, although I treasured it, I am irresponsible. The wallpaper
roller was lost.
</P>
<P>
   But I know where to find another one.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of wonderful old tools _ cheap and not so cheap _ can
be found in a lot of places these days: country auctions, flea
markets, swap meets and, maybe best of all, the Internet. I just
missed a set of five Bakelite-and-wood wallpapering tools, which
sold for $9 on eBay, the online auction site. Last week, eBay had a
whole box of wallpaper tools at a starting bid of $5.
Unfortunately, they were new, which the seller seemed to think was
their main selling point.
</P>
<P>
   But often old tools (the ones labeled ``antique'' seem to be
expensive) are made better, and, many of us believe, work better,
too. Just this week, eBay was peddling vintage wallpaper presses
from Maine (to imprint a ``wallpaper look'' on walls, the seller
said); Bakelite pottery tools in orange, red, green and amber;
planes made of Brazilian woods; and a rosewood-handle mortise gauge
trimmed in brass.
</P>
<P>
   If you are buying a gift, it doesn't matter if you don't know
what a mortise gauge is _ as long as the carpenter you love wants
one. This is not the same as buying a tie: ask for a list of
specific tools, and then ferret them out.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't know an awl from an ax, the Internet may be the
best, cheapest place to search for old tools _ implements with
provenance and patina. Just take your list and enter the key words:
for a 14-inch steel-blade back saw, you enter ``back saw'' and see
what comes up.
</P>
<P>
   On eBay last week, a set of Lutz drafting tools from Germany,
arrayed lovingly in a polished hardwood box, sold for $15. A set of
chip-carving tools went for $6.61. An old L.L. Davis 26-inch wooden
level trimmed in brass brought $53.65. An antique rosewood Stanley
No. 96 brass-bound level sold for $358.34, with 24 people bidding.
(There's that word ``antique.'')
</P>
<P>
   I've done some buying and selling on eBay recently, and,
generally speaking, the items I bought were pretty much as
described and arrived soon after my check cleared. Shipping charges
are usually detailed in the item description. If you have
questions, be sure to ask before you bid; eBay makes it easy to
send e-mail to the seller.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose you can't find what the Christmas boy or girl wants?
</P>
<P>
   For the real collector, there is www.mjdtools.com, run by Martin
Donnelly, a 44-year-old amateur carpenter. A few years ago,
Donnelly went to a hardware store looking for a saw and could find
only one, with a handle cut out of a single piece of plywood,
priced at $28. ``I couldn't bear to buy it,'' Donnelly said. Later,
he found himself at a local auction bidding $15 for two saws made
in the late 1800s. They had rosewood handles with bushels of wheat
carved on them. ``Driving home, I had to stop the car and just look
at them,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Although www.mjdtools.com (or www.oldtools.com,
www.toolsrules.com, www.tooltimer.com or any number of other sites)
is full of esoterica (an early cooper's compass for $225; an
Atwater's Tiger wrench for $265; a Goodell-Pratt No. 4 gear-driven
hand drill for $550), Donnelly said plenty of good old tools are
floating around for $5 to $10. And they are practical.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Bakelite wallpaper roller, many of these tools work
better than new ones. Many are heavier and don't drift on a
workbench like newer ones. (Garrett Wade in New York sells new
tools made to old designs, at much higher prices than originals you
might find on eBay or in a bin at a country auction _ but then,
they're brand-new.)
</P>
<P>
   Take pliers and prying tools. Fifty years ago, they were made in
dozens of shapes, unlike the one-size-fits-all versions now sold in
hardware stores. It was easy to assemble a collection in no time. I
have a collection of old pry bars, including a long, thin handmade
bar of spring steel. It's perfect for removing old moldings; I got
it for 75 cents at a tag sale.
</P>
<P>
   Old planes, because their metal and wood parts were fitted by
hand, often have more adjustments _ useful for fine woodworking. As
an example, Donnelly cited Stanley's skewed-blade rabbet plane, a
specialist's tool on which the cutting iron is set at an angle,
indispensable for cutting figured woods. ``It's the best rabbeting
plane ever made,'' he said. Because such planes aren't made
anymore, and because carpenters need them, ``they bring even more
money than if they were only sought by collectors.'' He added that
he doesn't happen to have any in stock at the moment. The planes
usually bring $300 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   But the thrifty should not despair. Small, ordinary tools like
bevel gauges, planes and wood-handle hammers and screwdrivers might
sell for $1 to $5 at a flea market or swap meet. I once bought a
small wood and iron plane for $3 in an antique-junk shop in North
Scituate, R.I. The plane is a gem: It's handy in small places
(sometimes you can even plane a sticky door without taking it off
the hinges), the blade is easy to sharpen and, well, it feels very
good indeed. And the old rock maple, polished by decades of use, is
a joy to look at.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone ever buy plastic again?

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Indianapolis (No. 1) and Jacksonville (No. 2),
and a larger difference between Indianapolis (1) and Detroit (4).

THE BEER NUT ISN'T A QUACK, BUT THIS BEER IS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I provided a pronunciation guide in this column,
for Japan's Asahi beer, a letter poured in from a reader. This
person took me to task for issuing bad information, and then
questioned my qualifications. This indicated to me that some people
have more time on their hands than is good for them and me. So
herewith, I set forth new rules: I pronounce it any way I want to,
and so can you.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely why I rhyme Kwak Belgian Ale with ``Quack.''
Nobody at the pub where we tried it knew how to pronounce it,
including the barkeep. But we all had a jolly good time making lots
of amusing duckie noises. So as far as I'm concerned, it's Kwak.
Jimmy Kwak corn, and I don't care, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Deep cleansing breath. All right, now that I've vented,
let's yak about Kwak.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it is pronounced ``Quack,'' but with less emphasis
on the final ``ck.'' The Web site said so. So there. Second, you
may not be familiar with the beer, but you've probably seen those
top-heavy mugs with small globes at the bottom that require a
wooden stand for serving - that's a stirrup-cup, a Kwak
innovation/marketing gizmo. Third, Kwak has been brewed since 1791
by the same family operation, which is kind of neat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the beer. Kwak builds up an enormous head of
thick, creamy foam that throws off a nicely scented bouquet. Tiny
bubbles make delicate, textbook-style Belgian lace patterns on the
inside of the glass. The rich amber color confirms the spicy,
almost clove palate, and bitter, chewy caramel finish.
</P>
<P>
   One final thing: the complete name of this beer is ``Pauwel
Kwak,'' pronounced ``PAW-uhl KWA-ck.'' ``Pauwel'' is in teeny-tiny
letters, while ``Kwak'' predominates. Is it the name of the 18th
century, mutton-chopped dude pictured on the label, hoisting a cold
one? Is it a place? A thing? Animal, vegetable, mineral?
</P>
<P>
   Haven't a clue. Twenty minutes online couldn't help me, either.
I may not know what it means, but by God, I can pronounce it, which
means I can order it and drink it.
</P>
<P>
   What more do I need?

GETTING A RICH-PERSON YULE LOOK ON A PAUPER'S BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am looking at the raw materials of my Christmas, and frankly,
they're pretty pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   A box of 15 cheap glass ball ornaments, missing four that were
long ago broken. A 12-foot swatch of gold lam. Eight strings of
miniature white lights. Sixty mismatched tree ornaments, in every
shape, color and motif, including a hand-painted wooden teddy bear
that says ``Someone in Missouri misses you'' and a fraying red
satin ball decorated with my fifth-grade school picture. A couple
of strings of gold beads; two velvet stockings; a holly-flocked
table runner.
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff I've been carting around for years, my
personal Christmas stash, culled from family hand-me-downs,
well-intentioned gift exchanges and the after-holiday sale bin at
Pier 1. Pretty much everyone who decorates for the holidays has a
version of this collection; the average family will spend just $77
on holiday decorations this year, according to an American Express
survey.
</P>
<P>
   So, every year, we haul the boxes out of the attic and try to
make the same old stuff look fresh. Also Christmas-y. Vaguely
reminiscent of whatever our parents did. And, if possible, stylish.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept scares me so much that I usually just buy a
few poinsettias, throw ornaments onto the tree and keep the lights
low through the holidays. But this year will be different, because
I begged for this assignment. This year, I got to do what the rich
people do: use professional help.
</P>
<P>
   There is an entire industry of designers and florists who, for
$40 to $80 an hour, will bring in greenery, lights and decorations,
mix it in with your own belongings, and set up the whole shebang.
And they say there is nothing wrong with being sentimentally
attached to your decorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We LIKE to use their stuff,'' says Lexa Northington, owner of
Lexa's Flowers and Gifts in Fort Worth, who decorates for private
homeowners and such clients as Rivercrest Country Club. ``It's more
personal that way. I don't like to just put a department store in
their house.''
</P>
<P>
   My decorator, of course, gets instructions from me that real
clients probably wouldn't use: We can't spend more than $100, we
have only a couple of days between planning and executing, and it
has to be easy enough that friends might believe I did it myself.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better idea of what I'm in for, I do my research,
consulting Tony King _ a decorator who once did Sylvester
Stallone's house and who now serves as the resident Christmas
expert at icelebrate.com, an Internet decor retailer based in
Irving, Texas. After reading up on King's Web site advice and
watching his tree-trimming video, I have a sense of false
confidence. How hard can this be?
</P>
<P>
   A few nights before decorating day, I take King's advice and get
everything out, spreading baubles and lights and ribbons all over
my dining room table. By the time my designer shows up _ Mary K.
Griffith, of the family-owned C.C.'s Touch of Nature, an
orchid-arrangement and antiques retailer in Fort Worth _ I've made
a few determinations: I probably have enough lights. My ornament
collection does kind of have a theme _ lots of stars, lots of gold,
good representation of tacky. And for the rest _ I need help.
Badly.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith sorts through the mess quickly, picking out the
highlights (the piece of gold lam, a pretty red ceramic
candleholder). Everything else she is brutally honest about, in a
way you can't be about your own stuff.
</P>
<P>
   A 100-bulb strand of white lights is tossed aside because
they're on a white cord _ they'd look tacky on the tree. A stack of
silver place mats and matching organza napkins that I love is
dismissed because they don't look right with the other colors. A
pine-cone wreath is inspected and deemed acceptable as long as the
garish white-and-gold bow is removed. (''It looks like it belongs
at a wedding,'' Griffith says.)
</P>
<P>
   All in all, she's very forgiving; she says that my mismatched
ornaments will be fine, that surely we can find something to do
with that stray gold embossed napkin and that plaid ribbon. She
even likes a carved wooden Santa wall hanging that I've never known
quite how to display.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Griffith leaves me with simple instructions: Buy
a pretty tree, plug in all the lights and make sure they work, cut
the piece of gold cloth into four equal strips, and find last
year's gold candles, just in case. She'll take care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Griffith pulls up to my house with a minivan
full of Christmas. We unload poinsettias, boughs of pine, cedar,
noble fir and blue-berried juniper, a big branch of yaupon holly
with pretty red berries, some wooden fruit and pine cones, and a
fresh centerpiece of juniper, cedar, noble fir and pine cones.
</P>
<P>
   We do the tree first, starting with the lights. After that,
Griffith drapes the strips of gold fabric, starting at the top and
looping them in lazy, irregular S-curves toward the bottom, rather
than a horizontal wrap. She leaves me in charge of the ornaments.
Tony King recommends doing two trees _ one with the ``pretty
ornaments,'' one with the decorations the kids made _ to those
clients with the space and money. Since I have neither, I hide the
rattier-looking decorations at the back and put the shiniest ones
where they'll stand out. But even the teddy bear (a gift from my
10-year-old niece) and the ornament with my grade-school picture
(made by my favorite aunt around 1974) find a place of honor.
</P>
<P>
   On the mantel, Griffith arranges a flow of greenery and berries,
studding it with seven crosses that I usually display scattered
around the house. (She used a sprig of holly left over from another
job, but you can also sprinkle in cranberries.) Then she adds a
small arrangement of pine cones, green apples and lemons. More
greenery goes on the dining table, around a centerpiece that we
place on one of my gold napkins and top with a gold pillar candle
and two small mesh gift boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the tiniest of changes makes a difference _ she
suggests hanging the two velvet stockings next to each other,
rather than on opposite ends of the mantel, where they get lost.
Rather than hanging the carved Santas, she props them up in a
basket and surrounds them with scraps of fir and cedar. A
forest-green table runner that was too long for my dining table
gets wrapped around the base of the tree. A ceramic candleholder
that always seemed too small looks much better with a wreath of
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   It takes the two of us, plus a friend who mostly just lay on the
couch and pointed out the bare spots on the tree, 3 1/2 hours to do
the tree, the mantel and three table-top decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill? After we finagle a bit _ removing a few pieces of
fruit from the mantle, using one fewer poinsettias _ it comes to
just under $104. And the result? It looks like my house at
Christmas _ except a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   So I did what any smart person on a budget would do: I took
pictures. Next year, I'm going to have to re-create this myself.  &QL;

SOFTENING SPIRITED SIBLING A STRUGGLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is how much my son loves his little sister: We were making
chalk outlines of ourselves on the driveway, and Sarah had me trace
her in bright yellow chalk.
</P>
<P>
   After we were done, Adam laid down beside her outline so his arm
overlapped hers and said, ``Will you trace me like this so it looks
like we're holding hands?''
</P>
<P>
   So I traced a big, green outline of him, and the green and
yellow blobs did, indeed, look like they were holding hands. Which
is about as close to holding hands with Sarah as Adam is ever
allowed to get.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah, my 3-year-old, has been as independent as a wild mustang
since she came into her personality at about 9 months old. Feisty
and stubborn don't even come close.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the at-home Montessori preschool Sarah attends, where
she is actually encouraged to be an independent thinker, she tests
the teacher's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In her ``Goals for the Year,'' Ms. Sharon stated that: ``Sarah
is a sweet, caring child I feel honored to be able to work with.
She is strong-willed and very intelligent. I think with patience
and commitment, we will be able to bring out the best in her. She's
adorable as well. It took me a while to figure out how to reach
Sarah without interfering with her own spirit. ... Every day I tell
her and the others that time out is not a punishment, it is a
choice that they make.''
</P>
<P>
   You see how carefully she has sprinkled in the words
``strong-willed,'' ``patience'' and ``spirit.'' Oh, sure, she threw
in ``sweet,'' ``intelligent'' and ``adorable'' to cushion the
impact. But I LIVE with the child she's writing about. I know.
</P>
<P>
   And listen: Ms. Sharon didn't even HAVE a time-out policy until
Sarah got there.
</P>
<P>
   At home, our new theory is this: Sarah has a little too much
spirit, and we intend to crush some of it. She spends a lot of time
in her room, and has even received a few swats on her bottom for
blatantly hurtful behavior that endangered herself or someone else.
(This from parents who never spanked their first-born and were
proud of it.)
</P>
<P>
   What we tolerated at 2 is getting a bit much at 3. But the thing
that pains me the most is to see the way Sarah offhandedly rebuffs
Adam's affections. He waits until she's asleep to kiss her cheek,
so he won't get pushed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Sarah even likes me,'' he'll say at night, close
to tears. ``Why can't I have a normal little sister?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, a normal little sister would be boring,'' we tell him.
``And Sarah is definitely not boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Be sweet to your big brother, I tell her again and again.
``Someday, you're going to want him to do you some favors, and
he'll have given up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to Adam's credit, he keeps trying. And sometimes, when you
least expect it, Sarah responds. Last night I went downstairs to
get some water and when I came back up, Adam was in bed beside
Sarah, finishing her bedtime story. And she was curled up next to
him, listening. I was so thrilled, I grabbed the camera. Sarah
noticed me out of the corner of her eye, and gave a big smile at
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``ADAM,'' she said, in her most bossy stage whisper. ``SMILE.
Mama is taking our picture.''

   ``More Matter''
</P>
<P>
   by John Updike
</P>
<P>
   Essays
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $35
</P>
<P>
   John Updike is America's pre-eminent man of letters, and, at age
67, he has published his 50th book.
</P>
<P>
   Man of letters? That's defined as one who does it all: composes
verse, hatches novels and short stories, reviews other writers,
works critically, and delivers essays that touch on many spheres _
religion, politics, sports, feminism, health, economics, the fine
and popular arts _ and is so esteemed that everything he publishes
in The New Yorker and sundry literary periodicals eventually finds
safe haven between hard covers.
</P>
<P>
   That's John Updike, and here we have one of his cut-and-pastes,
in which every component has previously appeared in print. He has
run out of titles, so this is merely ``More Matter,'' a 900-page
compilation of 184 essays, reviews and other ruminations.
</P>
<P>
   Updike is an acknowledged as major novelist, but subtract the
Rabbit Angstrom series from his fiction inventory, and few among
his 14 other novels rate as major. Nor is he an easily defined
poet, pitched uncertainly between traditional verse forms and the
oblique fashion of our day. It is as an essayist that John Updike
shines brightest. The reader is regaled by a persuasive
intelligence and serenaded by graceful prose bereft of cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The four-part organization identifies ``Large Matters,''
``Matter Under Review,'' ``Visible Matter'' and ``Personal
Matters,'' although all of it seems equally personal. Within each
subdivision are snippet entries and much longer compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how John Updike writes, taking on the 1950s: ``The
Fifties in my mind's eye are a waxy blue-white, a shining Cold War
iceberg drifting by in the wake of the khaki-brown Forties and the
grit-gray Thirties. As a child of those two shabby, beleaguered
decades, I was happy in the Fifties; I entered them as a penniless
high-school senior and left them as a home-owning father of three
children and the author of three books, with a fourth, ``Rabbit,
Run,'' submitted to the publisher just as the decade ran out. Many
Americans were happy in the Fifties _ but not as happy, looking
back, as we should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Gender and Health'' subdivision of ``Large Matters,''
Updike is curious that The Song of Solomon passed muster with the
Bible-makers: ``The Song, which never once mentions God, was
included in the Bible most probably because, like Proverbs and
Ecclesiastes and Job, it was a treasure of Hebrew literature. No
other love poem from this literature survives. Its attribution to
Solomon gave it the protection of a revered historical name.''
</P>
<P>
   Other topics serve appropriately as hors d'oeuvres, but
literature is Updike's entree, and he's keen and engaging,
especially in considering the shorter fiction of Herman Melville,
the identity struggles of John Cheever, and several takes on Edith
Wharton. Old movies are an Updike passion, and the best (and
longest) of several movie-themed pieces salutes ``Genial, Kinetic
Gene Kelly'': ``He had plenty of ginger but no Ginger: although he
danced affectionately with Leslie Caron, amusingly with Debbie
Reynolds, snappily with Judy Garland, bouncily with Rita Hayworth,
broodily with Vera-Ellen, and respectfully with statuesque,
stony-faced Cyd Charisse, we think of Gene Kelly as a guy in
loafers and a tight T-shirt tap dancing up a storm all by his
lonesome.''
</P>
<P>
   There's consistent charm in Updike's writing, but this would be
a more treasurable volume at perhaps two-thirds its present length.
Some entries are simply too trivial. ``The Twelve Terrors of
Christmas,'' for one, is a strain, something you or I might write,
although we aren't in Updike's league. Also, a shorter book might
be more modestly priced. At $35, /(More Matter/) is steep. However,
if you have his other 49 books, you'll certainly want this one. (

 (bl)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lucretia Moroni Is a mistress of illusion. What a set
designer does to the stage, she does to a home. When she paints on
panels of fabric, or on walls, ceilings and floors, surfaces become
mosaics, frescoes, taffeta. With paint, she conjures Moroccan
bazaars, Pompeiian courtyards, Indian souks. She makes visual
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moroni's style, a subtle trompe l'oeil painted in exquisite
hues, is a legacy from Renzo Mongiardino, the Italian interior
designer famed for his voluptuous, intensely sensual rooms, who was
her mentor for four years in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moroni was 21 and living in Milan when a friend introduced
her to Mongiardino. ``The first two years, I worked for free,''
said Ms. Moroni, now 38 and living in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his Milan studio, she learned to paint poppies on silk
velvet, clusters of rubies, emeralds and sapphires on gauze. In
1984, he sent her to New York City for a year, where she helped
execute his designs for the apartments of William S. Paley and
Stavros Niarchos, who both lived at 820 Fifth Ave. She spent a lot
of time riding the elevator, with a clutch of painted fabric in her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   From Mongiardino, who died last year at 81, Ms. Moroni learned a
singular lesson: a room is a three-dimensional painting. Minimalism
is not in her vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Design sophisticates have never shied away from ornamentation,
of course, but the appeal of Ms. Moroni's work also reflects a
budding counter-current to today's stripped-down Modernism _ a
longing for sumptuous materials and luxurious patterning that's
showing up in fashion, fabrics, even restaurant interiors. There is
in her work a hint of fin de siecle extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moroni was born to the world of textiles. Her family name,
which dates to 13th-century Bergamo, Italy, translates in the local
dialect as ``berries of a mulberry tree.'' (The tree's leaves are a
silkworm's favorite food. Who knew?) Silk, a fabric her family
first imported and later manufactured, was the first canvas she
painted on.
</P>
<P>
   Today her company, Fatto a Mano (Made by Hand), produces fabric
and wallpaper, and she does custom design. (Her initial consulting
fee for designing a room is $800 to $1,500.) Like Mongiardino, Ms.
Moroni practices a layered opulence. Her initial designs are dense
_ colors upon colors, borders around prints, prints  &UR; on &LR;  borders.
But her style is more lighthearted. ``I first do it quite
layered,'' she said, ``then I take away.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite motifs are Oriental, which she culls from Arab
mosques, Indian paisleys, Japanese kimonos. She is inspired by a
lotus on a Korean vase, the leaves of a ginkgo tree, pierced work
in an Islamic gate.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jayne, a Manhattan decorator with whom she has
collaborated, notes that there was little pattern in midcentury
design, and what there was was small scale. ``Lucretia's sense of
pattern is more expansive than her predecessors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For clients in a Tribeca loft, who wanted their home to evoke
Morocco, Ms. Moroni began, as she always does, by studying the
architecture. She noted that the loft did not have much natural
light and that not all the walls reached the ceiling. The design
was not coherent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started with the colors to make it  &UR; become &LR;  architecture,''
she said. In the living room, she painted the walls a warm yellow,
which she then rubbed with a rag, so that the color shifts subtly.
She painted the doors in the same direction as the wood grain,
which was sometimes vertical and sometimes horizontal, giving the
wood more texture. And on the front doors, she painted a Moroccan
motif, a six-pointed star, in gold leaf, mulberry and beige. The
result is a room that feels sun-drenched yet airy, and whose colors
change elusively with the light in the course of the day.
</P>
<P>
   If Morocco suggests languor, there is a perfect corner for
languishing. An Indonesian caned chaise, with lavender cushions
silk-screened in gold, is set by the windows. The cushions are only
partly attached to the chaise; they don't slip off, yet the
original caning is visible.
</P>
<P>
   Fluttering in front of the windows is a sheer panel of
silk-screened gauze _ mulberry on a pale yellow ground. The fabric,
printed in a curvy, Indian-inspired design, acts as a scrim.
Lighted from behind, as when the sunlight streams through, it's
transparent. At night, when the light is from within, it's opaque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gauze is the best solution for people who don't want to lose
light but want a real screen at night,'' said Ms. Moroni, who
worked briefly as a set designer. ``You can see through it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept the walls bare for the clients' photographs and
drawings. Instead, she treated the sofa pillows and the rug as
pictures _ abstract fields of color _ and framed  &UR; them &LR; . Each
pillow is two colors _ one is cream on one side, peach on the other
_ and each side is edged in a different silk border, each painted
with arabesques of leaves and vines.
</P>
<P>
   The taupe sisal rug became a floor painting the moment it got
 &UR; its &LR;  frame. Ms. Moroni painted a star motif, the same as on the
front doors, on a wide strip of linen, then had it stitched onto
the edge of the rug.
</P>
<P>
   Like most artists, Ms. Moroni is fearless about color. Just as
the living room is serenely aglow in yellow, the bedroom is a study
of lavender without an ounce of grandmotherliness. The walls are
painted a striated lavender, a deft trompe l'oeil that looks like
watered silk. It was a trick that took three steps. She painted the
walls in one shade, then painted them with a slightly darker glaze.
Before the glaze dried, she took a dry brush and, stroking in
straight vertical lines, removed some of the glaze.
</P>
<P>
   In her apartment on lower Madison Avenue, sheer panels of gauze
divide office from studio, and studio from living space. The walls
are hung with bolts of hand-painted fabrics. There are ochre and
olive leaves on a sheer rust-colored linen. A dusty blue scroll
motif is hand-painted on velvet woven to look aged _ bare-looking
in places. When she painted on the fabric, the pigments cracked,
making it look even older.
</P>
<P>
   In her living room, the sofa is covered in a lavender silk
printed with oversize, abstract flowers in soft shades of
cornflower blue, rust and mulberry that shimmer in the light. The
design was inspired by one on a kimono. For the armrests, she
wrapped the lavender silk in a stripe-on-stripe silk that shades
from gold to tangerine to persimmon. On top of that, widely spaced,
are hand-painted lavender stripes.
</P>
<P>
   The sofa, a field of flowers, sits in front of a white and
yellow wall with a border of mulberry flowers. And in a final
gesture of ornamentation, Ms. Moroni painted a part of the wood
floor in a cream-colored Persian motif, so that the sofa looks as
if it were sitting on fragile lace. This bit of painted whimsy is

   Stoddart gets his fabrics from Egypt, Italy and Belgium and then
sends them to workrooms in Portugal, Vietnam and Madeira. He finds
some hand-embroidered trim in the garment district. Much of his
cotton is Egyptian percale, ``390-thread count,'' he said _ not
thick but soft.
</P>
<P>
   While fine-linen companies often promote thread counts of 300 to
600 threads per square inch, sheet experts say superhigh thread
counts can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between 120 and 250,'' said Warren
Shoulberg, editor of Home Textiles Today. ``You can feel and see
the difference.'' But beyond 250 threads per square inch, he said,
it doesn't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perceptible difference between 250- and 400-thread-count
products is probably more in your mind than in your hands,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American mills are the only manufacturers in the world that
focus on thread count,'' Shoulberg said, adding that thread-count
wars, which started in America in the late 1980s, created a
competition to draw a new market. Until then, he said, it was hard
to find counts of over 200 threads in the mass market.

</P>
<P>
   What about Park Avenue white? ``Oh no, not white,'' the
maverick-minded future Mrs. Farkas said. ``I only use white out at
Water Mill'' _ a reference to Farkas' beach house.

WEBER PR WORLDWIDE BUYS D.C. LOBBYING FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A unit of Weber Public Relations Worldwide &UR;  &LR; in
Cambridge, Mass. has acquired a lobbying firm headed by Haley
Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Weber has made a slew of acquisitions since it was bought by the
Interpublic Group of Cos. of New York three years ago. But Barbour
Griffith &AMP; Rogers of Washington will be the first lobbying firm in
its portfolio, chairman Larry Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Barbour Griffith &AMP;
Rogers projects 1999 revenues of $8 million, Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Weber began life as a public relations firm
representing high-tech companies. As those companies have grown,
they've needed a host of new services, including government affairs
and lobbying, as decisions made by the federal government have
affected how high-tech companies do business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has found that out in an ongoing federal
antitrust lawsuit. Microsoft is one of Barbour Griffith's clients,
as are Delta Airlines, Glaxo Wellcome Inc., and CBS Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Since being bought by a unit of New York-based IPG three years
ago, Weber has been looking to buy firms with different areas of
expertise to serve its clients.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Weber bought Ryan McGinn, since renamed Weber
McGinn, a Washington-area firm that specializes in government and
public affairs, a discipline that includes providing public
relations on behalf of firms embroiled in federal lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Government affairs is distinct from lobbying, which seeks to
influence bills before Congress and policies determined by the
executive branch of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic
nominee for vice president, joined Weber McGinn. Her job is to
advise corporate clients on women's issues such as glass ceilings
in the workplace, compensation, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   A future Weber acquisition could be of a Democratic lobbying
firm to complement Barbour Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a different unit of IPG purchased Cassidy &AMP;
Associates, a lobbying firm with Massachusetts ties. And recently
IPG's archrival, the Omnicom Group, saw a Canadian company it owns
buy McDermott/O'Neill &AMP; Associates of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Both IPG and Omnicom are scrambling to put together networks of
communications companies that can serve nearly every conceivable
need of large global clients such as Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   IPG also owns Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos and Mullen, two
of New England's largest ad agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Weber said Weber Public Relations Worldwide projects
1999 revenues of $97 million, up from $15 million in 1996, the
firm's last year as an independent public realtions shop.

<P>
   Moving the Internet a step closer toward fulfilling its promise
to be all-inclusive, We Media, a three-year-old company serving the
disabled and their families, recently unveiled a full-service Web
site aimed at that market.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, www.wemedia.com appears much like many other
commercial or service sites, with lots of information and links to
shopping. But each mouse click beckons users to explore a range of
offerings, including education, employment, travel and financial
services made to appeal to the needs of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Fields, co-founder of We Media, said that as many as 54
million Americans considered themselves disabled, a group that he
said had more than $1 trillion in spending power. Being able to buy
groceries, bank and communicate with friends and family by way of
the Internet is especially important for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers users free e-mail and computer-based
long-distance phone calls over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the site, like the We Media magazine, have special
software that enable users with impaired vision to hear rather than
read the site. Alexander Spinelli, We Media's chief technology
officer, said the company is being ``very aggressive in its ongoing
effort to make it completely accessible.''

   Web Portal for the Arts Promotes Genre-Hopping
</P>
<P>
   Culture vultures have a new place to nest on the Internet.
ArtandCulture.com, a portal site for all things aesthetic, was
scheduled to make its debut Thursday on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Each of its 1,000 entries on artists, performers and cultural
movements is accompanied by an incisive essay and a small set of
links to related Web sites (www.artandculture.com).
</P>
<P>
   Although the entries are categorized by artistic discipline, the
site's goal is to encourage visitors to explore subjects beyond
their usual enthusiasms. Marc Lafia, the site's founder and
editorial director, said, ``The great thing about the computational
platform is that it lets you put Rabelais next to William S.
Burroughs.'' The entries are assigned descriptive labels like
``intimate'' and ``bubblicious.'' Stephen Sondheim, the site says,
is bubblicious. Led Zeppelin is not.

   A Way to Feed the Hungry With Only the Click of a Mouse
</P>
<P>
   E-shopping may be easy, but a new form of charity on the Net is
absolutely painless: one click on the Hunger Site, and the U.N.
World Food Program gets three cups of rice, corn, maize or other
staples _ at no charge to the donor.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is borne by corporate sponsors, who contribute a
quarter-cup of staples (a half-penny's worth) for every Web browser
who clicks the Donate Free Food button at www.thehungersite.com.
Only one click a day per visitor is counted.
</P>
<P>
   For the sponsors, it's good image advertising because everyone
who donates sees a thank you screen carrying the logo of each
sponsor. For the world's 800 million hungry people, it's adding up
to a million cups of food a day. Worldwide, the United Nations
estimates, some 24,000 people die from hunger each day,
three-quarters of them children under 5. So this new use of the
networked world has been a boon for the food program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty incredible,'' said Abby Spring, a spokeswoman for
the program. ``It's a wonderful opportunity to involve individuals
around the world, and as more sponsors join, the amount of money is
really growing. The first check we got went to a school feeding
program in Ethiopia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hunger Site, created and run by John Breen, a 42-year-old
computer programmer from Bloomington, Ind., began on a small scale
in June but is now gaining momentum rapidly. On Monday, the site
had 12 sponsors _ some signed on for a few days, others for longer
_ and more than 350,000 visitors clicked to donate food.

   Tonga Is Set to Go Online To Stake Its Millennium Claims
</P>
<P>
   While there is some debate about which piece of inhabited land
will be the first to greet the new millennium, the Pacific islands
that make up the Kingdom of Tonga seem to have a reasonable claim
to the honor. At the stroke of midnight in Tonga on New Year's Eve
it will still be 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the occasion, Forthenews.com, a San Francisco-based
Internet company, will offer a series of live Webcasts of the
Tongan millennium celebrations. ``They don't have a broadcast TV
station in Tonga, but they're doing some very sophisticated things
with the Internet,'' said Alan Shulman, president of
Forthenews.com. ``Tonga has been virtually ignored by all the
millennium committees.''
</P>
<P>
   At the stroke of midnight, Tongan time, Shulman said, the Real
Video feed to his company's site, www.forthenews.com, will show
King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV praying in front of a choir of 10,000
Tongans. Another part of the site will feature a series of
millennial firsts from the yet-to-be-created Hall of Firsts within
Tonga's Royal School of Sciences. Among the planned features are
the first cup of coffee, the first kissand the first profit and
loss statement. Shulman is trying to sell corporations on the idea
of sponsoring these firsts and will also auction the rights to
perform some of them. ``Some duffer is going to want the first golf
swing,'' Shulman said. ``It will be the highlight of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the site will also train one of its Webcams on a
personal computer to, as a company announcement puts it,
demonstrate to the world ``the reality of Y2K problems, at least in
Tonga.''

   Peek at Coming Books And Make a Donation
</P>
<P>
   The next book of nonfiction by historian Stephen E. Ambrose,
``Nothing Like It in the World,'' will not be published until next
summer, but fans can get a head start on Wednesday, when Chapter 6
will become available online.
</P>
<P>
   The early publication is part of a fund-raising effort by Simon
&AMP; Schuster and Reciprocal Publishing, a company that creates
technology to protect digital material from being illegally
reproduced. Excerpts from written works by at least six well-known
authors will be available for viewing at www.hotauthors.com. Those
who take a peek are asked to donate $1 to $10 to benefit a
nonprofit group called Literacy Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that it takes a whole chapter to get people
reading,'' said Ambrose, who last week sent Simon &AMP; Schuster the
edited script of ``Nothing Like It,'' which is about the building
of the first transcontinental railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster plans to post other excerpts, including
chapters from Jackie Collins' upcoming novel ``Lethal Seduction.''
Stephen King, Mary Higgins Clark, David McCullough and the estate
of Kay Thompson will also take part.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising effort marks the introduction of new technology
intended to prevent digital content from being copied and
distributed without the publisher's permission. Those who view the
chapters will not be able to cut and paste paragraphs, but they
will be able to view and print the chapters they select and even
forward them to friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be able to e-mail this content around the world,''
said Matt Moynahan, general manager and a senior vice president at
Reciprocal. But when a recipient clicks on a link in the e-mail
message, Moynahan said, ``they will have to make a $1 donation to
receive a key to unlock it.''

   Conspicuous Consumption For the Internet Generation
</P>
<P>
   Looking for just the right gift for that new Internet
millionaire on your Christmas list? Something that says both money
and technology? The Financial Literacy Center, in conjunction with
the Henry Ford Museum and Berner Machine Labs, has just the ticket,
or ticker: an exact replica of Thomas Alva Edison's original 1870s
universal stock ticker.
</P>
<P>
   Exact, that is, but for three things: It will set you back
$35,000, it gets its market data from the Internet and it is a
decidedly useless, if arguably delightful, anachronism, more
sculpture than tool.
</P>
<P>
   Any serious day trader can get financial data much more quickly,
conveniently and inexpensively by using a portfolio service on the
Internet. And when the day is over, the trader can walk out the
door without sweeping up several hours' worth of ticker tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Literacy Center, which says it ``provides
innovative, educational and motivational products to help people
use money effectively in their lives,'' is justifying this pricey
piece of nostalgia by limiting first-year production to 300 tickers
and by assembling what it calls a ``dream team'' of craftsmen to
reproduce the machine. The team consists of two machinists, a
historian, a computer specialist, a violinmaker (he studied old
wood finishes) a woodworker, a printer and a
``jack-of-all-trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Confounding categorization, the replica is described as a
``meticulously crafted, working replication'' with ``a glass dome
cover and a beautifully handcrafted mahogany pedestal.'' But hidden
inside that pedestal is a ``plug-and-play coputer interface'' that
also enables the ticker to spit out sports scores and personal
messages.
</P>
<P>
   So, if it helps, think of it as a $35,000 pager. Orders _ or
rather, ``reservations'' _ are being taken online at

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation announced Wednesday that it
has agreed to sell Sports Afield magazine to SA Acquisition
Corporation and Motor Boating &AMP; Sailing magazine to Times Mirror
Magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The sales are expected to be completed in the first quarter of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement, Cathleen P. Black, president of
Hearst Magazines, said both magazines ``have enjoyed long and
illustrious histories thanks to their great staffs and committed
readers.'' Black said that because both magazines were highly
specialized titles, Hearst sold them to companies that are more
focused on niche publications.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Petersen, chairman of the board of SA Acquisition
Corporation, said Sports Afield was the oldest outdoor magazine in
America and ``one of the most prestigious titles in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Afield, ``The Magazine for Today's Sportsman,'' was
founded in 1887. The Hearst Corporation acquired the magazine in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, targeted to the outdoor sports enthusiast market,
has been nominated for more National Magazine Awards than any other
outdoor magazine, according to a Hearst spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen is a real estate investor and owner of a jet charter
service.
</P>
<P>
   Efrem Zimbalist III, chairman and CEO of Times Mirror Magazines,
said the decision to buy Motor Boating &AMP; Sailing demonstrates Times
Mirror's commitment to acquire strong brands in attractive markets
that fit with the company's outdoor enthusiast editorial focus.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Charles, senior vice president of Times Mirror
Magazines and the head of Times Mirror Magazines' Marine Group,
said Times Mirror's other marine titles include Yachting and Salt
Water Sportsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having three major titles in the marine field will help us
better meet our advertisers' needs for a marketing partner, as well
as our readers' needs for quality content,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Motor Boating &AMP; Sailing, ``The Boat Owner's Magazine,'' was
founded in 1907 as a yachting publication with the original title
Motor Boating; the word ``sailing'' was added to the title in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst acquired the magazine in 1909 as part of
his fledgling magazine operation. The legendary Charles F. Chapman,
author of the seaman's bible Chapman's Piloting, served as editor
and publisher for 55 years.
</P>
<P>
   Motor Boating &AMP; Sailing has won more than 50 editorial and
design awards, more than all other boating magazines combined,
according to a Hearst spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Other Times Mirror magazines include Field &AMP; Stream, Freeze,
GOLF MAGAZINE, Outdoor Explorer, Outdoor Life, Popular Science,
Ride BMX, Salt Water Sportsman, Senior Golfer, Ski Magazine,
Skiing, Snap, Snowboard Life, The Sporting News, Today's Homeowner,
TransWorld SKATEboarding, TransWorld SNOWboarding, TransWorld
STANCE, TransWorld SURF, and Yachting.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines is a unit of The Hearst Corporation and the
world's largest publisher of monthly magazines, with 16 U.S. titles
and 98 international editions distributed in more than 100
countries. Of these, Hearst publishes nine monthly magazines in the
United Kingdom through its wholly owned subsidiary, the National
Magazine Company Limited.

SINN FEIN LEADER SAYS BRITISH BUGGED HIS CAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, accused British
spies Wednesday of bugging a car in which he held secret meetings
with IRA leaders last month, in negotiations that broke an impasse
in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and the Irish government demanded an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair told the House of Commons
that he would not publicly discuss intelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately, Sinn Fein officials said the bugging
controversy would make it harder for the Irish Republican Army, its
military wing, to take steps toward disarming by February. The
Ulster Unionist party says that by then it will leave the new
power-sharing government of Northern Ireland, unless it sees
evidence that the IRA is disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the IRA remain skeptical about the thought of turning in
their arms, and there is a long history of mistrust between the IRA
and the British intelligence services. The IRA says that British
intelligence agents exploited truces that the IRA had called in
1972 and 1975, in a cynical attempt to target the guerrilla
organization's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Sinn Fein briefly pulled out of talks with the
British government after a routine scan for listening devices by
party officials detected what they said was a bug in a photocopier
that Sinn Fein was using.
</P>
<P>
   Adams had been scheduled Wednesday to unveil his party's agenda
for the power-sharing government that was formed last week. He
surprised a press conference at the Stormont assembly building by
displaying instead what he said was a sophisticated,
satellite-aided listening and tracking device.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the device had been planted in the Ford sedan that he
and other Sinn Fein officials had used in negotiations mediated by
George Mitchell, the former US senator from Maine. Adams had used
the car to discuss with IRA leaders various proposals to break the
impasse over disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever authorized the bugging operation, he said, was trying to
return to a ``security agenda'' that prevailed when the problem in
Northern Ireland was considered to be fighting the IRA rather than
try to find a negotiated political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves the `securocrats' are still fighting their little
war,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Downing Street officials refused to discuss the matter,
it remained unclear whether the bugging operation had been cleared
at the level of Blair's Cabinet, as most sensitive intelligence
operations are.
</P>
<P>
   If it was an unauthorized operation, the Blair government will
come under pressure to investigate who approved it and why. If it
was cleared at the highest levels of the government, Blair may be
forced to explain what Adams called ``a breach of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the power-sharing government
formed last week, backed calls for an investigation into the
alleged bugging.
</P>
<P>
   The bugging allegation was an unsettling aftermath to the high
point reached last week when an arduously negotiated settlement
transferred power from London back to Northern Ireland for the
first time since 1974, turning governance over to the first-ever
Belfast government to include both unionists and Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   But while the bugging controversy showed the dearth of trust
among the parties, there was also promising news in Belfast
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defense
Association, held a press conference at which six of its masked
leaders announced that it would begin discussions with the
international commission in charge of disarming paramilitary
organizations in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But the loyalists, using their Ulster Freedom Fighters cover
name, said they would begin to disarm only after the IRA did.

`FORTUNE'S ROCKS:' PAINTING THE ONSET OF DESIRE A RICHER COLOR IN
1899 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know more or less from the opening scene what is going to
happen in Anita Shreve's skillful new novel, ``Fortune's Rocks.''
On a warm June day in 1899, Olympia Biddeford, soon to turn 16,
walks out along a beach at the New Hampshire community called
Fortune's Rocks after the offshore hazard on which so many ships
have foundered. She does so forbiddenly during the men's bathing
hour and senses for the first time in her young life the nature of
desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This first brief awareness of desire _ and of being the object
of desire, a state of which she has had no previous hint _ comes to
her as a kind of slow seizure,'' the narrative intones, ``as of air
compressing itself all around her, and causes what seems to be the
first faint shudder of her adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   You are certain that Olympia will shortly become entangled in an
illicit love affair, thus shattering the equanimity of her Boston
Brahmin father, a man of letters three generations removed from the
making of a Brockton shoe-manufacturing fortune, whose hopes for
Olympia are so high that he has taken it upon himself to educate
her at home in preparation for Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a friend of his soon shows up, John Warren Haskell,
a doctor and essayist who does volunteer work in a medical clinic
serving one of the nearby mill towns. Despite Haskell's being 41
and married with four children, Olympia is attracted to him both
for his bearing and for his involvement in a world so alien to her
sheltered life, and her feelings are reciprocated.
</P>
<P>
   After accompanying Haskell on his medical rounds and watching
him conduct a breech birth, she begins a passionate affair with him
that culminates in a lurid scene in which his wife spies them
through a telescope as they make love on the altar of a
deconsecrated chapel in the Biddefords' summer cottage, which was
once a convent.
</P>
<P>
   The family's reputation is ruined. Haskell's marriage falls
apart. Olympia turns out to be pregnant, and after bearing a boy
and having him taken away from her and put up for adoption, she is
sent off to western Massachusetts to be trained as a teacher at the
Hastings Seminary for Females. Eventually she rallies and tries to
reclaim her child. The story climaxes in a stirring custody trial,
followed by a series of unexpected reversals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its hackneyed sound, this tale is engagingly told by
Ms. Shreve, among whose previous six novels are ``The Pilot's
Wife,'' ``Resistance'' and ``The Weight of Water,'' the latter of
which was set on the Isles of Shoals, not far from the site of the
present story. With the help of slightly heavy-handed
foreshadowings of disasters to come _ ``In time Olympia will learn
of the obsession with the `other,' that person from whom the theft
is made _ the wife, the former mistress, the fiancee'' _ the plot
draws you into its increasing tension.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shreve seems comfortable in the past, which she has visited
only intermittently in her fiction. Among the books Olympia's
father assigns her to read, she remembers in particular ``The
Valley of Decision,'' ``A Tale of Two Cities'' and ``The Scarlet
Letter,'' ``since they are all works written in one century about
another, the purpose of which is an issue her father and she debate
at some length (her father taking the position that the social
mores of a previous era might better highlight certain moral
dilemmas of one's own time, and Olympia holding to the notion that
Edith Wharton or Charles Dickens or Nathaniel Hawthorne might
simply have been drawn to the baroque language and richer color of
an earlier era).''
</P>
<P>
   Both these arguments seem valid in the case of ``Fortune's
Rocks,'' highlighting as it does the issues of women's autonomy and
their custody of children in a more repressive era, and celebrating
as it does if not baroque language then certainly a more formal,
ornate style of expression (except for occasional slips, like
``girls not much older than her,'' and ``the woman is not as tall
as her,'' which make Ms. Shreve sound more like a contemporary
teen-ager).
</P>
<P>
   The drawback, of course, is that at times you feel that you've
read it all before, in dozens of novels, including Judith Rossner's
powerful ``Emmeline,'' about a Massachusetts cotton-mill girl who
is seduced and abandoned. Ms. Shreve brings little particularly new
to the genre, as, for instance, John Fowles did to ``The French
Lieutenant's Woman'' by making his heroine a rebel against
conventional male-female relationships. (Ms. Shreve's heroine is a
rebel, too, of sorts, but she would happily settle into marriage to
Haskell if she could.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's pleasure in the conventional power of ``Fortune's
Rocks.'' At its best _ in the trial scenes, in the moral dilemma
posed by the trial's conflict and in Olympia's stalwart character _
it evokes those elemental emotions that are reborn in every new
reader and that remain like bedrock in the most sophisticated of
readers. Some stories never grow tiresome, and in ``Fortune's
Rocks,'' Ms. Shreve has captured one of them and kept it alive and
pacing in its cage.

REGPLIGEN AUTISM DRUG IN SINGLE   DOSE SAID DEFICIENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Repligen Corp. said Wednesday that secretin, its drug to treat
autism, does not appear to work after a single injection, although
company officials predicted that more positive results will appear
with higher doses.
</P>
<P>
   The Needham, Mass. biotechnology company said the New England
Journal of Medicine will publish Thursday a study by a North
Carolina group that independently tested the drug on 18 patients.
``A single dose of synthetic human secretin is not an effective
treatment for autism or pervasive developmental disorder,'' the
study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Repligen, which owns the drug, was not involved in the
evaluation but plans to launch its own test early next year with
about 100 autistic children taking multiple doses over three or
four months.
</P>
<P>
   Repligen stock closed Wednesday at 3 3/16, up 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Autism affects 500,000 Americans and is a disorder in which a
young child cannot develop normal social relationships. There are
no drugs to directly treat the disorder, although in some cases
drugs are used to control aggressive and self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Many autistic youngsters also suffer from gastrointestinal
problems such as repeated diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Repligen maintains that multiple doses _ not the single dose
results chronicled in the New England Journal of Medicine _ will
lead to changes in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids whose diarrhea disappears in 48 hours after taking
secretin tend to have normal stools and very often this leads to
improvement in autistic symptoms, such as better eye contact,
improved communications and trailing after siblings,'' said Walter
C. Herlihy, Repligen president and chief executive, officer whose
8-year-old daughter Lilian is autistic.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that in March, a Wall Street Journal article
revealed some promising results based on anecdotal evidence from
over 1,000 autistic patients who had used secretin as an
experimental drug. Those findings prompted a group of investors in
Ashville, N.C. to sponsor a formal clinical trial. However, they
relied on a single dose of secretin with four weeks of observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did is analogous to measuring behavioral changes in
an Alzheimer patient with one dose of a drug,'' said Herlihy. ``We
have always said a single dose does not produce significant
results.''

 &HT;    Fasting to reduce an `overstuffed ego'
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Later this month, Fawa Abukhali will
spend the last 10 days of Ramadan inside the small white mosque on
Purdy Lane in West Palm Beach. He will pray. He will fast. He will
rise before dawn from the carpeted floor each morning to spend his
day in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will go to those lengths. But fasting during the
holy month of Ramadan is obligatory for every Muslim old enough and
healthy enough to go without food and water from sunrise to sunset.
The fast is undertaken to purify the body, promote self-discipline,
renew a focus on spirituality and increase compassion for those in
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how God wants us to feel,'' Abukhali said.
</P>
<P>
   This simple act of going without food for a sustained period of
time is one of the oldest and most universal religious practices in
the world. Fasting during Ramadan dates back to the seventh
century, when Muslims believe the Koran was revealed to the prophet
Mohammed. Buddhists fast periodically to clear their minds,
emulating the Buddha, who, they believe, reached enlightenment
1,000 years earlier while engaged in a 36-day fast. Jews, who fast
on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), can trace their tradition
back to Scriptures written even earlier. And until the mid-'60s,
Catholics fasted from Saturday night until communion Sunday morning
as well as some days during Lent.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is more written in the New Testament about
fasting than either repentance or confession, most Protestants _
the largest religious group in America _ have never fasted for
spiritual purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That may change. Scholars of religion say that fasting gains
popularity during times of spiritual upheaval. (Fasts were
organized in the mid-1700s and early 1800s, for example, during
nationwide spiritual revivals.) And this, many evangelical
Christians believe, is a time of spiritual upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way in organizing fasting in the evangelical
Christian community is Bill Bright, founder of the youth ministry
Campus Crusade for Christ. Bright said that in 1994 he heard the
voice of God tell him to lead the United States to repentance
through orchestrated communal fasts. He teamed up with other
high-profile evangelical preachers _ Pat Robertson and Promise
Keepers founder Bill McCartney among them _ to reach as many people
as possible. Organizers say that in the past five years, close to
10 million Christians have fasted as a result of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these fasts take place during Lent. Others are
year-round, with a different member of a church fasting every day
for 365 days. Last month, 3,000 people gathered in Houston's
Astroarena and an estimated 2 million people from 40 countries
joined them via the Internet to take part in a 28-hour fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this because I was so overcome by a sense of the
moral and spiritual disintegration in this country, from the inner
city to the White House,'' said Bright, who used the $1 million he
received as recipient of the Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion to promote fasting. ``Jesus did not begin his ministry
until he fasted for 40 days.'' Bright says he believes a fast
remedies much more than a bloated body; it can deflate an
``overstuffed'' ego as well. And that, Bright says, is one of the
biggest issues facing Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so self-indulgent,'' he said. ``There is something
about denying yourself that brings us closer to the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Some evangelical Christians believe fasting can have societal
impact as well. Americans, they say, have grown almost arrogant in
their refusal to abide by spiritual laws: witness school shootings,
community violence, a degenerate media.
</P>
<P>
   These moral failings, many Evangelicals believe, will eventually
invite God's wrath. By fasting, Christians can not only forge a
closer relationship with God, they can better understand their
place in God's universe.
</P>
<P>
   Fasting, simply put, teaches humility, says Eddie Smith, a
coordinator with The National Prayer Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have a choice,'' says Smith. ``Humility or
humiliation. If we choose to humble ourselves, then God won't lead
us down the road of humiliation. But if we remain self-centered and
materialistic, people will go through humiliation. Because God will
not be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Fasts undertaken by Christians today tend to be structured like
those in the Bible, lasting anywhere from one day, to three, seven,
21 and 40-day periods. Some are complete, others cut out only
liquor and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Bright has talked at length about his 40-day fasts, where he
survives on fruit and vegetable juices. And Paul Cedar, a pastor
and chairman of Mission America, which champions fasting, says he
typically loses 22 to 24 pounds during his annual 40-day fasts. But
he is able to maintain his energy and keep up nearly a full work
load with just a glass of juice three times a day, he says. ``The
body goes through an acclimation process,'' said Cedar. ``The first
day or two is uncomfortable because your body is going through food
withdrawal. But when it realizes you aren't going to starve to
death, you really stop thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Temple, an associate pastor at First Baptist Church of West
Palm Beach, fasted for 40 days in 1997 and said he became aware for
the first time of the incredible focus Americans put on food and
eating.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his fast, Temple said, he and his wife were struggling
with infertility and money problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving one day and I was thinking about these things
and I just had this sense God was asking me, `What are you willing
to do to ... See me multiply your family or help you with your
finances?''' Temple said. ``I said, `God, I'll do anything,' and he
said, `Will you take 40 days and do it with me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Temple said he would. He used a juicer at home and drank kiwi,
orange, apple and pineapple juice every evening and canned fruit
juice and water during the day. He lost 44 pounds, and said he
became more humble and more clear-headed.
</P>
<P>
   And during his fast, the baby he and his wife would later adopt
was conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still hard for me to talk about,'' Temple said. ``I still
get choked up. I'll tell you what, there is an emotional intimacy
with God that comes along with fasting that is addictive.''

   CLINTON BACKS NASA CHIEF, POLICY
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Lipman
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Dec. 6 -- President Clinton defended NASA and its
``faster, better, cheaper'' credo at a press conference Wednesday,
reminding reporters about the difficulty surrounding missions
mission like the missing-and-presumed-dead Mars Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all used the slogan 'this isn't rocket science.' Well,
this is rocket science,'' Clinton said. ``And we're trying to take
a spacecraft the size of a boulder and throw it 450 million miles
into an uncongenial atmosphere_ and it isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's most important is (Clinton's) vote of
confidence in (NASA Administrator) Dan Goldin,'' said John Logsdon,
director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington
University. ``He's not pointing fingers and saying heads must
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dan Goldin has done a great job at NASA,'' Clinton
said, ``He has gone for smaller, more discreet missions_that I
think makes a lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing with Clinton about the value of smaller missions,
House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee Chairman Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif., said the jury's still out on Goldin's reputation in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to wait and see what the cause of this failure
was before I can give my support to Mr. Goldin's administrative
skills,'' Rohrabacher said. ``I think his strategy of faster,
better, cheaper is verified by this,'' because a lost mission now
costs far less than when NASA lost larger missions before, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mars Climate Orbiter was lost due to a lack of
training and communication that led to an embarrassing conversion
error, Rohrabacher said, NASA faces pressure to prove that the
Polar Lander was not felled by a similar mistake. If a human error
did doom MPL, he said, ``Well, then Mr. Goldin's credibility will
be questioned and there will be some problems. There will be a
hearing on this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong with
'faster, better, cheaper,' it's a matter of how fast and how
cheap,'' Logsdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke about the continued importance of the space
program and downplayed the importance of the MPL failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important, not only for the American tradition of
exploration_ it's also important because _ we have to keep doing
this if we ever want to know what's beyond our own galaxy,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the fatal Apollo 1 fire that killed three
astronauts in the 1960s, Clinton said, ``This is nothing compared
to the tragedy of astronauts who burned to death when their
spacecraft was still on the ground. I don't think I'll ever forget
that for the rest of my life. But they didn't quit, and America
didn't quit, and I'm glad. And I don't think we should quit now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to stay positive,'' Logsdon said. ``NASA has
already said its deeply troubled _ so the president doesn't need to
say anything else.''

BUSH AIDE: GAY GOP GROUP TOO CRITICAL OF CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top campaign strategist
defended the Republican presidential frontrunner's controversial
decision to snub leaders of a gay GOP group, asserting Wednesday
that the Log Cabin Republicans have been critical of Bush on
several issues.
</P>
<P>
   The strategist, Karl Rove, said the group's leaders have asked
for meetings with Bush ``with the stated purpose of coming in and
explaining why Governor Bush is wrong on gay adoption or why he is
wrong on broadening the Texas hate-crimes bill'' to protect gays
against attacks based on their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, who is based in Austin, Texas, added in a meeting with
reporters here that ``the national office of the Log Cabin
Republicans has been critical of Bush and is in fact doing a
fund-raiser for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has ``a limited amount of time, and we're just not
going to set aside right now a time to meet with (Log Cabin
leaders) and talk about their dialogue,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his hate-crimes and anti-gay-adoption positions, Bush,
as governor, has refused to support gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Rove held out the possibility of a future meeting between the
group and Bush but said the candidate already enjoys support among
gays. ``We have gay Republican supporters and advisers who are
involved in the campaign and whom we meet with regularly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the
nation's largest GOP homosexual group, called Rove's remarks ``very
disappointing.'' He added that ``his comments are not at all
reflective of the long and cordial relationship that we had with
him for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Tafel, the group's executive director, said Bush ``has
created what has become a confrontational situation. We have now
heard five different reasons why they won't meet with us. Now it's
because we attack them. The campaign is saying, `We don't need to
hear your opinions. Get on board.'''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began after Bush's response last month to a
question on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Asked whether he would meet
with the Log Cabin Republicans, Bush replied, ``Probably not.'' He
contended that such a meeting would create ``a huge political
scene,'' and added, ``I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider.
I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group of people
against another. And all that does is create kind of a huge
political, you know, nightmare for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who also is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination, recently met with the Log Cabin
Republicans in Washington. Like Bush, McCain opposes gay marriage
and adoption and new hate-crime laws, but he told the group he
would battle discrimination against gays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in other campaign matters, Rove said Bush will accept
federal matching funds for the general election, assuming he wins
the Republican presidential nomination. Under government campaign
spending rules, a candidate who accepts federal funds must abide by
spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining Bush's decision, Rove told reporters that ``it is
awfully difficult to raise $60 million or thereabouts between the
(political) convention and the Election Day and still campaign.''
He said Bush doesn't want to have to focus on fund-raising, but
would rather be out ``shaking hands.''
</P>
<P>
   During the long pre-primary season, Bush has raised an estimated
$70 million on his own, which has allowed him to forego federal
funds and spending limits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rove also said that while Bush holds a commanding lead over the
five other Republican candidates in national polls, ``every month I
expect the numbers to tighten appreciably.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a new survey released Wednesday by the American
Research Group, a polling organization based in Manchester, N.H.,
shows McCain leading Bush in New Hampshire 37 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush could stumble in some of the nine major primaries
held early next year. In addition to New Hampshire, Rove said
McCain ``is competitive'' in his home state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line in one of those nine early states
there's going to be a rough patch or two in the road,'' Rove said.
``But we have built a campaign that is able to endure and win and
compete everywhere.''

   Five thousand years of recorded history provided the House &AMP;
Home section with a few thoughts on holiday gifts for 1999. We
looked back, then we looked forward, and realized this: favorites
never go away.
</P>
<P>
   We narrowed the list to five categories, each with a range of
prices (half are under $50), with objects that excite the eye
(chrome, glass, design!), challenge the mind (technology, toys!) or
set the spirit soaring (a French Art Deco mirrored radio from the
1940s). Our choices were highly personal (what better way to give a
gift?) but with the universally useful within view, too. And these
collations of past and present could also make stylish predictions:
for the right recipient, a collecting direction in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   We start with New York, on this page. A great town since 1626.
And getting better: we found the book that teaches you clever
things to do with empty MetroCards.
</P>
<P>
   Glass. It's been a glittering hit since 2,500 B.C. Jewels like a
1950s Murano paperweight won't break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Radios. On the air since 1906. They are the frequency of
adolescence: give a 1960s model to your teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Toys have been around since the beginning. Made for children or
adults, our hand-crafted ones are pets you won't have to walk.
</P>
<P>
   And last but not last call: bar ware. The celebration can't
start without it. Think of New Year's Eve 1999 as the ``Last Gas
for 1,000 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass:
</P>
<P>
   1. A glass hand to hold rings and other baubles was cast from a
19th-century mold. It is $11.25 at Fishs Eddy, 889 Broadway (19th

   SCULPTURE-CITY (subslug) (In the Nevada Desert) _ Michael Heizer
doesn't want you to know where he lives, just that he's in the
middle of nowhere in the middle of Nevada. Heizer has just
completed the first phase of his sculpture ``City.'' The structures
_ which he calls ``complexes,'' using a term archaeologists use for
buildings at ancient sites _ are massive concrete and dirt
mastabas, rectangles with sloped sides. What now exists of ``City''
has got to be one of the most massive modern sculptures ever built.
After nearly 30 years, Heizer has passed the first stage toward
completing what is essentially his own Chichen Itza in the desert.
There are four stages more to go. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).

   GREEN-MILE-FILM (Hollywood) _ ``The Green Mile'' will open on
Friday in theaters across the country. Directed by Frank Darabont,
whose first film, ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' drew seven Academy
Award nominations in 1995, it is also based on a Stephen King story
and also set in a prison. In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a Death
Row prison guard in the 1930s who comes to believe that one of his
prisoners, a gentle and somewhat dim giant played by Michael Clarke
Duncan, has supernatural healing powers and may, in fact, be a kind
of angel. By Rick Lyman. (Moved).

   AMADEUS-THEATER (London) _ ``My tongue is stupid, but my heart
isn't,'' remarks the errant genius Mozart in ``Amadeus.'' And a
sprightly genius he proves to be, too, in Peter Shaffer's
metaphysical melodrama, which combines speculative historical
musings with a meditation on divine injustice. Shaffer's play, a
revival, will open Wednesday at the Music Box Theater on Broadway.

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   METROPOLITAN-OPERA (New York) _ Following the Metropolitan
Opera's ups and downs is a prime entertainment for any music-loving
city dweller. Though many call the house's vision dull, its
week-by-week operation offers plenty to chew on. Wagner's ``Tristan
und Isolde,'' now near the end of its limited run, has been a
considerable success. Assembled were Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner,
two principals who represent the present and the future of an opera
notoriously hard to cast. With them was one of the important Wagner
conductors of the century, James Levine, and a pit orchestra as
good as any in the world. Levine's ``Tristan,'' like much of his
Wagner, is very slow, but it was salutary to surrender to a
different point of view and follow it to a conclusion: a trip worth
taking. By Bernard Holland. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMOPHON-CENTENARY-MUSIC (Undated) _ For good reasons,
Deutsche Grammophon's Centenary Collection is heavily concentrated
in the decades after World War II, a period including the history
of the LP and the boom time of the CD. &UR;  &LR; In these years, recording
fidelity started from a high plateau and generally climbed, and
political and social side issues gradually fell by the wayside. The
performers are now better known if not necessarily more
distinguished. &UR;  &LR; Much of the material here will be familiar to
collectors of my postwar generation. By James R. Oestreich.

   LAS-VEGAS-OPERA (Las Vegas) _ What news on the Rialto?
</P>
<P>
   Since spring, they've finished construction on the bridge and
filled the Grand Canal; a few blocks down, a new Paris has its
Opera, Eiffel Tower and Hotel de Ville; and ``O'' has spoiled me
for ``The Ring.'' Greetings from Las Vegas, self-styled
Entertainment Capital of the World, where I have lately landed to
contemplate new frontiers for opera: opera, for the purposes of
this discussion, standing for something greater than itself.
Somewhat to the surprise of observers unattuned to the cyclical
rhythms of cultural history, an art form that within the lifetime
of composers now near their prime was being written off as a
moribund anachronism is experiencing something like a renaissance.
By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   SCYTHIANS-ART (San Antonio, Texas) _ The story of the Scythians,
how they lived, died and were buried with the things they coveted _
gold, jewels, armor and pottery _ is told in ``Gold of the Nomads:
Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine,'' an exhibition of 171
objects here at the San Antonio Museum of Art, through Jan. 30. The
show was organized by the museum and the Walters Art Gallery in
Baltimore, where it moves in March. By Rita Reif. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MORIYAMA-PHOTOS (New York) _ Daido Moriyama, 61, was everywhere
in New York this fall. The subject of exhibitions at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Japan Society and the Laurence Miller
Gallery; of a handsome catalog on his life and work (from the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and of essays in prominent art
magazines, he has enjoyed scholarly star treatment that no other
Japanese photographer has ever been given in this country. The
reviews were mainly raves. By Richard B. Woodward. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   LOAMY-ART (New York) _ If outdoor earthworks are difficult to
preserve, an ``interior earth sculpture,'' which is how the
conceptual artist Walter De Maria described his 1977 installation
in a Manhattan building, has its own upkeep demands. Twenty-two
years ago, De Maria transformed a desirable 3,600-square-foot piece
of SoHo real estate into something useless. ``The New York Earth
Room'' is 250 cubic yards of earth, piled 22 inches deep. Today,
the work has art historical significance and also provides a
welcome respite from the shopaholics on SoHo's crowded streets.
Some 10,000 people visit the piece annually. One can't walk on it _
a glass barrier contains the earth and keeps people out _ but a
loamy smell definitely permeates the space. By William Harris.

   TV-BECKER (Undated) _ ``He's the most flawed character I've ever
written,'' says David Hackel, proudly, of Dr. John Becker, the
middle-aged lead character played by Ted Danson, the ex-``Cheers''
matinee idol sitcom star. Becker is a politically incorrect
malcontent with no real counterpart in today's youth-obsessed
sitcom world. Positioned neatly at 9:30 p.m. on Mondays on CBS
behind the hit ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``Becker'' the show
regularly finishes in the Nielsen top 20 and has become what
Hackel, 51, a veteran sitcom writer and producer, a bit nervously
calls a ``stealth'' success. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-WB (Undated) _ For three years running, the WB television
network has been the favored child of Madison Avenue ad buyers,
media types and teenage-girl America. A trio of freshman shows are
doing well: ``Popular,'' ``Roswell'' and ``Angel,'' the last an
offshoot of WB's flagship, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' Of course,
none of the new shows have gone above No. 107 in the ratings, but
by WB standards they're hits. Each of the three has growing buzz
and critical support. Each is set in the present day in one of
three WB preferred locations: high school, college or
flunky-job-early-stage adulthood. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).

`SWEET AND LOWDOWN' HITS THE RIGHT NOTES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, Dec. 10 or later. Fact box at bottom) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Sweet and Lowdown'' is whimsical Woody, a charming little faux
biography that drolly combines a couple of Woody Allen's passions _
jazz music and artistic obsession _ into a delightful movie that
should go a long way to erase any lingering hard feelings over last
year's painful ``Celebrity'' misfire.
</P>
<P>
   Allen pops up in the movie as one of the expert commentators
examining the life of mythical 1930s jazz guitarist Emmet Ray (Sean
Penn). (Jazz expert Nat Hentoff also makes a cameo.) Emmet's a real
piece of work: On stage, he makes beautiful music; the rest of the
time, he's a selfish, cocksure lout. He's a man who loves the
ladies (his favorite dates: shooting rats at the dump and watching
trains), but refuses to become emotionally involved with anyone
because it might compromise his art.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare day off, Emmet meets a woman who improbably makes him
change his mind about love (insofar as Emmet ever alters his
outlook). Her name is Hattie (Samantha Morton), a mute laundress,
able to hear but not speak. In other words, she's a perfect
girlfriend for the self-absorbed Emmet; he comes to love her and
she him.
</P>
<P>
   But Emmet keeps butting up against his credo: I'm an artist; I
need to be free. Allen has explored the idea of the egotistical
artist throughout his career; movies have forever been his favorite
form of therapy (when he's not actually visiting the shrink
himself).
</P>
<P>
   Here, the autobiographical elements are out in full force for
Allen aficionados to sift through and ponder. Emmet sees himself as
the world's ``second-greatest guitarist,'' forever in the shadow of
gypsy great Django Reinhardt. The Woodman worships in the house of
Ingmar Bergman. (He was saying ``We're not worthy'' long before
Mike Myers.) He also has a messy personal life _ just like Emmet _
but excuses his failings by his devotion to his work.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't need to know any of this to enjoy this likable
movie. Allen has a knack for perfectly capturing earlier time
periods (``Bullets Over Broadway''), and he's aided here immensely
by long-time production designer Santa Loquasto, costumer Laura
Cunningham Bauer and cinematographer Zhao Fei, who bathes the
movie's nightclubs and shabby dives in a host of cheerful colors.
</P>
<P>
   Allen fills ``Sweet and Lowdown'' with deftly executed light
comedy and plenty of priceless sight gags, having great fun
throughout the movie with Emmet's Django obsession. Penn is perfect
as Emmet and Morton rates as an extraordinary find, an actress who
communicates on the level of silent film greats like Lillian Gish.
Uma Thurman again proves her Dietrich mettle in a wonderful
supporting turn, and director John Waters has a priceless cameo.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's sunny soundtrack, arranged by Dick Hyman with Howard
Alden supplying the sublime guitar work, is sweet music to the
ears, the best of the year. And why shouldn't it be? ``Sweet and
Lowdown'' comes from the heart, a bouncy meditation on music and
love that hits all the right notes with perfect style and finesse. &QL;

IN CHINA, WHERE FAMINE WAS ONCE A THREAT, OBESITY AND DIETS
FLOURISH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ms. Li, a 41-year-old entrepreneur, swept past the
bevy of nurses at the Beijing Yingdong Sanitary Weight Loss Center,
removed the jacket of her gray Chanel suit, primped her perfectly
curled hair and stepped nervously onto the scale, all the while
repeating what has become a mantra for many Chinese women: ``I'm
too fat. I'm too fat. I'm too fat.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked pretty thin.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent visitor to the center, with a year's membership card,
Ms. Li settled into to one of the 24 treatment beds, and strapped
on a wide leather belt adorned with 50 metal studs, that looked
like it belonged on a gladiator. A nurse in a crisp white uniform
plugged the belt into a generator, sending current through 50
acupressure points on Ms. Li's abdomen, her latest attempt to melt
away extra pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing so well _ I lost 25 pounds _ and then I went to
Europe and ate too many French fries, and the butter, and the
cheese,'' said Ms. Li, who said she was too embarrassed to have her
full named used. Dieting has become central to her life, she said,
as it has for her 17-year-old daughter, who is also a member here.
</P>
<P>
   Once a country of catastrophic famines, where a little extra
padding was valued as a sign of good health, China is today
obsessed with thin.
</P>
<P>
   Glossy magazines are filled with only the skinniest of models
and crammed with ads touting diet pills, diet teas and odd-looking
weight-loss machines. Diet centers are springing up even in small
towns and rural areas. At a time of economic uncertainty, weight
loss is an exuberant growth industry: The Yingdong company has
opened 10 centers in Beijing alone since its founding last year.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt business that in a country now filled with
temptations like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, childhood obesity
is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   While some are shedding pounds for health, most are pursuing a
new notion of beauty _ sometimes to dangerous extremes. Anorexia
nervosa and bulimia, once virtually unknown in China, have
multiplied exponentially in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there are more and more patients coming in,
especially teen-agers,'' said Dr. Zhang Darong, a Beijing
psychiatrist, who is one of the few doctors in China who treats
eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since China's opening and reform, the ideals and standards for
so many things _ including body type _ have changed,'' said Dr.
Zhang, herself a pretty if slightly stout middle-aged woman in a
white lab coat. ``Many people are paying more attention to
self-improvement. The girls see the beauty contests and the ads for
slimming drugs, and they absorb it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zhang said that she now has more than 20 patients a year
with anorexia nervosa and that seven or eight are so dangerously
thin that they need hospitalization. Twenty years ago, she might
see one patient a year.
</P>
<P>
   In newspapers and on television, experts like Dr. Zhang warn
young women that fad diets and pills can cause physical harm. But
the diet industry is largely unregulated, and it is hard not to
feel the pressure to reduce, with ads screaming everywhere that fat
is bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold now and you will probably be shouting, `I've gained
weight!' as you step on the scale,'' begins a magazine ad for the
May Flower Tea and Drug Weight Loss Package of 18 diet tea bags and
72 diet pills. And it explains: ``In winter your weight is probably
going up quickly and you look terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Or consider another ad showing a skinny model sipping a herbal
potion called ``Slim and Pretty,'' which ``works directly on fat
cells to dissolve them.'' Or another, for the Jinyanduo
Computerized Weight-Loss Machine, with its desktop terminal and
various pads shaped like body parts, which ambitiously promises to
``reduce weight, reduce wrinkles and build breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese girls all think thinner is better,'' said Teng Lue, a
16-year-old high student in Beijing. ``And fat kids are under a lot
of pressure to reduce.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Yingdong Weight Loss Center, Liu Yufang, an attractive
22-year-old English-language student, is 5-foot-3 and weighs 110
pounds; her goal is 101.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to lose weight,'' she said. ``Everyone I know is
trying to be thinner, most are taking medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   The new frenzy with thinness is in some ways a strange malady to
find in a country where older people still call a favorite child
``little fatty,'' as both a compliment and a term of endearment. It
is still the grandparents who take care of school-age children in
most of China, and the eating capacity of their little charges is a
generational obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, people admired and were even jealous of fat
people since they thought they had a better life,'' said Li
Xiaojing, general manager of the Yingdong. ``Some older people
still think pudgy is OK and fat is cute. But now, most of us, see a
fat person and think `He looks awful.'''
</P>
<P>
   Li Yifang, a skinny high school junior in form-fitting white
jeans and a black turtleneck, said that she and her grandparents
definitely have different beauty standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grew up around liberation,'' she said, referring to the
1949 Communist rise to power, ``and they weren't even supposed to
think about who was a man and who a woman, and nobody paid much
attention to appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we have the living standard and the confidence and the
time to think about such things,'' she added, ``and there are so
many pretty clothes to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many see the preoccupation with thinness as a sign of China's
economic progress. The emergence of eating disorders is certainly a
macabre milestone of sorts, indicating there is generally now
enough to eat in a country where tens of millions starved in the
famine of the early 1960s after the disastrous agricultural
experiments of the Great Leap Forward.
</P>
<P>
   Eating disorders are generally a malady of the developed world,
and in China today they are, predictably, found mostly in the
country's wealthy cities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zhang said that her patients tend to be well-off and
educated urban girls in their middle to late teens. In most cases,
she said, the diagnosis is made fairly late in the course of the
disorder since there is still great stigma attached to mental
illness in China. Many parents do not recognize eating disorders,
and assume they can force their children to gain weight by cooking
more or better-tasting food.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the girls' problems to a combination of the
intense academic competition in Chinese high schools and the
growing social pressure to be beautiful as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 14 or 15, these kids get out into society and they begin to
feel all sorts of external pressures,'' she said. ``And it's sad _
these girls come in so underweight and then they bring in
advertisements for us to look at and argue that they don't have a
problem.''

BRADLEY-MCCAIN MEETING WOULD BOOST CAMPAIGN REFORM EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrat Bill Bradley and Republican John McCain
are moving closer to agreeing on an unusual joint meeting in New
Hampshire to highlight their support of overhauling the campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidential candidates could meet as early as next
week, campaign aides said Wednesday. But the meeting could also
reveal some friction. While the two candidates belong to different
parties, they are competing for many of the same voters:
independents.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire law allows independents to vote in either the
Republican or Democratic primary, and campaign finance is a top
concern of many independents. Thus, Senator McCain of Arizona and
former Senator Bradley of New Jersey hope to convince Granite
Staters they have the best plan to change the way campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides for both candidates confirmed they have held
discussions this week about whether Bradley and McCain should meet
in Claremont, N.H., where President Clinton and then-House Speaker
Newt Gingrich met in 1995 and shook hands about the need to rewrite
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to them, and we have had additional
conversations,'' McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said. ``We are
hopeful that we can reach agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said the meeting would be worthwhile because ``anytime
Senator McCain can talk about getting rid of the undue influence of
special interests, it's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser was more guarded about a meeting,
saying, ``We'll see if something can work out. We're looking at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting would give both candidates a dramatic way to tell
voters they are reform-minded candidates who would try to
accomplish what other politicians have failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all the publicity about the Clinton-Gingrich
meeting, it did not lead to passage of a campaign finance bill, but
instead highlighted the inability of Congress and the White House
to make headway on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has long been a co-sponsor of campaign finance
legislation, while Bradley has said it is a centerpiece of his
campaign. The two agree on the need to ban unlimited party
contributions known as ``soft money.'' But they disagree on the
best way to overhaul the system. Bradley favors public financing of
elections, while McCain opposes that idea.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bradley so far have not met during the campaign, nor
have they talked on the telephone about a possible meeting, aides
said. But McCain, asked earlier this week about getting together
with Bradley, responded: ``I would love to do that. My
understanding is that my campaign has asked them to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, who advocates campaign finance overhaul as
president of a Washington-based group called Democracy 21, said
both McCain and Bradley have been leaders on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen this before on campaign finance to have the
issue taken very seriously by leading candidates,'' Wertheimer
said. ``In my view, their getting together can only be a plus for
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Bradley and McCain would try to reenact
the Clinton-Gingrich handshake, because Bradley recently criticized
that event as a symbol of what is wrong with American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind every public handshake, like the one in Claremont on
this issue, there's always been a secret handshake,'' Bradley said
last month. ``That tacit, secret handshake signals an agreement
among politicians not to upset a system they use to their
advantage.''

STATE STREET AND CITIGROUP AGREE TO JOINT VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State Street Corp. of Boston said Wednesday that it
would form a joint venture with Citigroup Inc. to gain a stronger
toehold in global pension markets, after the New York financial
services behemoth tried unsuccessfully to acquire parts of State
Street's business.
</P>
<P>
   Under the venture, State Street and Citigroup will combine their
401(k) retirement plan businesses. State Street will contribute two
units to the venture, to be known as CitiStreet. Citigroup, which
is the nation's biggest financial services company, will contribute
one subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston financial firm is a custodian for the mutual fund
industry, an asset manager, and the second-largest manager of US
corporate retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup had approached State Street last summer about
acquiring the two units, but the Boston company refused to sell and
instead proposed cooperating, according to James S. Phalen, a State
Street executive who will oversee CitiStreet.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup _ which owns banking giant Citicorp, the Travelers
insurance company, and brokerage and investment bank Salomon Smith
Barney _ did not try to acquire all of State Street, Phalen said.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, which unites two competitors with different
strengths, aims to blend State Street's leading presence in money
management and asset custody with Citigroup's strong marketing
clout and vast distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good move for State Street, which has the technological
know-how but not the global reach of Citigroup,'' said Thomas D.
McCandless, an analyst who covers the Boston company for CIBC World
Markets.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Citigroup hopes the venture will put some fire
into its lagging asset management business and give it better
access to big retirement-plan customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint venture will help Citigroup improve its position in
the US defined contribution market, particularly in the large
corporate marketplace,'' said Thomas W. Jones, head of Citigroup's
investment management and private banking group.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-50 venture, to begin operating in the first half of next
year, will focus on 401(k) retirement plans, the fast-growing
segment of investment management that has transformed the way
Americans save for later years.
</P>
<P>
   State Street manages retirement plans for huge companies such as
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., but unlike Citigroup does not have the
marketing resources to pursue midsize and smaller companies _ a
fast-growing market.
</P>
<P>
   Citistreet's competitors will include Fidelity Investments,
Merrill Lynch, and Hewitt Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which operates in more than 100 countries, will also
help the new venture expand into nascent retirement plan markets in
Europe and Japan, where State Street already has joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   State Street oversees $5.3 trillion in assets and manages $582
billion. The company has had strong double-digit earnings-per-share
growth for nearly two straight decades, but it is not expected to
continue growing at that pace.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup manages $443 billion, claims 100 million worldwide
customers, and sports a full menu of financial services, including
banking, corporate lending, asset management, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in both companies fell Wednesday. State Street slipped 2
5/16 to close at 69 1/16, while Citigroup fell 2 7/16 to end the
day at 54 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Citistreet, to be located in Quincy, Mass., will initially have
3,000 employees, mostly from existing State Street operations, and
annual revenues of more than $300 million, Phalen said. It will
start out overseeing $200 billion in assets and servicing 4 million
retirement plan participants.
</P>
<P>
   Under 401(k)s, employees invest part of their salary in mutual
funds or other investment products and their employers match part
of the contribution. Such defined-contribution schemes have
increasingly replaced defined-benefit plans, in which employers
bear most of the burden.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture combines two State Street units _ Retirement
Investment Services and WellSpring _ with Citigroup's Copeland Cos.
The two State Street units accounted for 6 percent of their
parent's 1998 revenue of $2.7 billion.

CLINTO HOLDS FINAL PRESS CONFERENCE OF MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A wistful-looking President Clinton acknowledged
Wednesday that living apart from his wife was not going to be easy,
but he said he was prepared to endure a long-distance marriage and
move to their newly purchased home in upstate New York when his
presidency ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be together as much as we can,'' the president said when
asked about Hillary Rodham Clinton's plans to move to New York,
where she is campaigning for a US Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's not the best arrangement in the world, but it's
something we can live with. I love the house, ... and I'm looking
forward to living there when I leave here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his final news conference of the year, Clinton was reflective
and at times defensive as he discussed his legislative record and
his adjustment to beginning a final year in office with both his
wife and his vice president away running their own political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton jumped easily from questions about foreign policy to
queries about his difficult post-impeachment year and his looming
commuter marriage. The president deftly avoided commenting on the
current presidential campaign, except to say that Vice President Al
Gore would ``be a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has announced she will soon move into the
couple's home in Chappaqua, N.Y. _ an abode she referred to as ``my
home'' when asked about it this week. The phrase spurred new
questions about the couple's sometimes troubled marriage, which has
been excruciatingly dissected by the media throughout Clinton's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton Wednesday said he planned to make the house his
home, as well.

<P>
   ``She's got to spend a lot of time in New York, so she'll be
there a lot,'' Clinton said, tilting his head with a slight air of
sadness. ``She'll be here when she can. I'll go up there when I
can. We always make it a habit to talk at least once, if not more,
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The president bristled when asked whether Gore's campaigning was
making him an absentee vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, obviously, he's not around as much,'' Clinton said of
Gore, adding that he ``terribly'' misses the weekly lunches that he
and Gore used to have.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was in the White House ``all day'' Wednesday, the
president insisted. ``In his critical functions, he's still
performing them,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did the president appear shaken by a reporter's
question _ one that centered on race, a favorite presidential issue
and the topic of a book Clinton is writing.
</P>
<P>
   Of 26 people who have held seven top advisory jobs at the White
House, not counting Cabinet members, all have been white, Clinton
was reminded. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly taken aback, the president at first said he disagreed.
When he was told that ``not a single person of color'' had held the
position of chief counsel, press secretary or senior adviser on
domestic, economic and national security issues, Clinton was
momentarily and uncharacteristically speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you might be interested to know there were a
couple of people of color that I tried to get to do these jobs that
preferred other jobs in the administration,'' Clinton said, not
naming any staffer. ``They had ... jobs they liked better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is I have never not tried to recruit
minorities for any job that was open in the White House, and I've
never followed a quota system,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is at work on a book about race, as a follow-up to the
national dialogue on race he initiated two years ago, though he
said Wednesday he didn't know when he will finish the book. ``I've
got a day job, you know,'' the president quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The president bluntly denied that his comments at last week's
meeting of the World Trade Organization _ during which Clinton
defended the concerns of labor unions and environmentalists _ was
designed to boost Gore with those campaign constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wrong,'' Clinton said flatly, adding that his
administration is committed to free global trade, with provisions
made to protect workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   When given an opportunity to criticize the health-care proposal
of Gore's opponent, former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, Clinton
demurred.
</P>
<P>
   The president criticized the failure of Congress to back health
care reform and spoke at length about the plan the Clintons had
proposed. But he would not discuss the competing proposals made by
his vice president and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get in the middle of the Gore-Bradley
campaign,'' Clinton said, chuckling a little. ``I know you want me
to, but I'm not going to do that for you.''

THE POP LIFE: THE LONG ROAD TO A NEW LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ ``All things unfinished or in turmoil around
me are reminders that I'm still alive'' is a quotation hanging on a
wall in the office of James Talley. ``Who would have thought that a
populist songwriter like myself would be doing this?'' he asked,
pausing before answering himself: ``I mean, I never thought it in
my wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s Talley was one of the most eloquent spokesmen for
the working man, rural life and the indomitable human spirit,
recording one strong album after another for Capitol Records. Fans
placed him in the lineage of Jimmie Rodgers, Woody Guthrie and Bob
Dylan. And he found a friend in a high place in President Jimmy
Carter, who invited Talley to perform at his inauguration ball.
</P>
<P>
   But today this man who was the voice of the blue-collar worker
spends his days at a desk in Nashville selling real estate. It is a
job that Talley, 56, has had for 17 years. ``Lord,'' he said from
behind that desk, ``I wish at one point in my life I had been in
the right place at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is no where-are-they-now story of dashed Nashville
dreams. Talley still has the day jobs he thought he would be able
to shed when, working as a carpenter, he sold his first album to
Capitol in 1975 for the low sum of $5,000, but he has in just a few
months turned his musical life around and started his own label,
Cimarron Records. After nine years of struggling and pleading with
Capitol, he was given the rights to release the albums he recorded
for it in the '70s (which have unjustifiably been out of print in
the United States for 20 years).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see where my mother came from,'' he said of her
upbringing as a tenant farmer in Oklahoma, ``you realize the
incredible determination it took for her to get a college degree,
become a schoolteacher and teach for 38 years. She taught me
determination by example. And those guys at Capitol know I'm one
determined son of a gun. They never met anybody as tenacious as
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week he will release his first album on Cimarron, ``Woody
Guthrie and Songs of My Oklahoma Home'' (available from his Web
site, www.jamestalley.com). He finished the album five years ago,
and it languished between Capitol's intermittent promises to
release it. It is Talley's good fortune that the recording is as
timeless as his best work and hasn't suffered by the delay.
Arranged simply and delivered perfectly in an incisive sing-song
storytelling style, the 20 songs on the album not only stand up to
the originals but also complete them, compensating for the
recording deficiencies that make many of Guthrie's recordings hard
to take in large doses.
</P>
<P>
   Talley went into debt to release the album but plans to put one
out every six months. ``You do wonder and you do despair, and you
do go through some incredible pain and suffering,'' he said. ``You
risk your fortune, you mortgage your house, you take what little
you've been able to accumulate and put it at risk to do something
because you believe in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Music business dilemmas have distinguished Talley's artistic
career from the beginning, when a fruitless signing with Atlantic
Records held up his first record, ``Got No Bread, No Milk, No
Money, but We Sure Got a Lot of Love,'' for three years as he moved
to Capitol. And his music and photography collaboration, ``The Road
to Torreon,'' bittersweet tales (many of them gathered while he was
a caseworker for the New Mexico Department of Public Welfare) about
Hispanic mountain families in New Mexico, didn't come out until 24
years after he wrote the songs.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as no surprise that Talley has long since completed
the album intended to follow his Woody Guthrie tribute. And where
once he found much of his inspiration in conversations with fellow
workers in his carpentry, social service and rat extermination
jobs, his writing has turned further inward and grown darker.
</P>
<P>
   This next album, which he plans to release next year, is called
``Nashville City Blues.'' And in the title cut, he comes on like a
piece of gum clinging to the sole of a cowboy boot, ``Got them
Nashville city blues/And I ain't leaving this town, people/Till I
get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Talley came to Nashville in 1968, influenced by Bob Dylan's
``Nashville Skyline'' album and under the mistaken impression that
Dylan was living here. But Talley stayed, performing in a style
equal parts country, folk and blues, and consequently remained a
Nashville outsider the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not supposed to be slick,'' he said, speaking of
contemporary country productions. ``It's supposed to be rough and
brilliant. The heart doesn't move to the click track. Life doesn't
move at one constant tempo. Life's full of times when you fell down
and skinned your knee, when your wife left you, when your
girlfriend threw your clothes out in the front yard and when you
had your car repossessed. Life is not like they make these records
in Nashville: It is not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Talley rarely performs these days and seems to have no intention
of giving up his job to face the vagaries of the record business
again. Some say he is a victim of the forced marriage of art and
commerce, others say he is a victim of his own hardscrabble
outlook. Either way, he has become one of the semitragic,
semiheroic Everyman who populate his songs or, for that matter, the
music of another great populist songwriter, Bruce Springsteen: a
character caught between dreams and reality, growing older to find
the dreams growing less vivid and the forest of reality _ of work,
family, immobility _ thickening around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose years ago I hoped to be at the point today where I
could sell out shows in a few hours,'' he said, speaking of
Springsteen's recent tour. ``But it didn't happen that way. And if
it doesn't happen that way, then you go on another way. Or you do
like Phil Ochs and you kill yourself. You know, I probably thought
about that a time or two during some of the really dark periods.
But then you say, `Well, if I do that, who's going to take care of
my kids and my wife?' And maybe, just maybe, I might still create
something good here.''

MAKING BOOKS: OF WRITERS VS. PUBLISHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They've undoubtedly been lamenting about one another since the
first author scratched some signs on someone else's cave wall, thus
creating the first publisher, and they'll very likely continue to
do so well into the millennium beyond the next. Since book
publishing has become list tickled _ this year the 100 best
nonfiction books written in English; last year the top 100 novels _
how about tabulating the top accusations that writers make against
publishers? And vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But which comes first, the authors' complaints or the
publishers'? Do they have a cause and effect upon one another?
Whatever, they need one another the way Pinocchio needed his
elastic nose. And although they often sound whiny when carping
about one another, their grievances are usually not
inconsequential, for nearly always the issues involve pride,
literary fame and, of course, fortune. No waggery about any of
this, particularly if one lives the loneliness of a writer's life
and depends on putting words on paper for a living.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a column of analytic interpretation, nor is it based
on a survey. Rather it is a collection of plaintive pleas, gathered
from listening. If the inferential results seem a bit loaded on the
writers' behalf it is because so many writers seem to have one or
more of the same complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers' complaints, on the other hand, are more particular
of certain writers, rather than the breed in general. And it's a
generic column, with no names, since the complaints, no matter how
legitimate, seem piddling when a name is attached.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest writer outrage of all is lavished on the ``no books
in the stores'' complaint. The novel or nonfiction work has
received a flourish of rave reviews; the touring author has been
interviewed so much on television and radio that the writer is
expecting his or her own groupies like professional basketball
players and, woe, there are not enough books in the stores, and
sometimes not any, when the customers ask for them.
</P>
<P>
   That can be the gallows for a book, and no publisher has ever
been able to come up with a proper excuse for that other than to
blame it on the delivery service, which is rather like saying the
check is in the mail but the post office lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``the book as orphan'' ailment. That is, in the
incestuous and mercurial business of book publishing, editors pop
from house to house with such apparent regularity that a writer who
signs up with one editor finds that midway through authorship (or
just as ghastly, at the moment of publication) the editor has
vanished like a ghost, and the book is in sort of a publishing
black hole. In short, an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   A subtext to this is the ``no one home'' problem. The author
calls the editor, but there's no one at the other end of the phone
wire, and no one bothers to call back. (This allegation is
sometimes leveled at the author's agent as well, increasing the
degree of frustration.)
</P>
<P>
   No writer, except perhaps some authors of blockbusters, ever
thinks their publishers print enough copies of books. And worse,
writers say, although they seldom prove it, their publishers
actually print fewer copies then they've promised. It has a nice
bumper sticker sound: ``Promise 50,000; print 15,000.''
</P>
<P>
   One could go on. Some writers say they're supposed to get their
royalty statements every six months, but there's always a
three-month delay, so they actually obtain one every nine months.
Willingness or unwillingness to be flexible on covers; not enough
say over jacket copy.
</P>
<P>
   Both greatly irritate authors, although their say in those
matters depends partly on how tightly their agents have structured
their contract. Moreover, few publishers will finally print book
jackets or flap copy that truly offend the author's sensibilities.
Editing? Forget it. Authors complain about copy editing, and
attribute the bad editing to too few editors or lack of editing
talent or, sometimes, laziness. (See below for publishers'
response.)
</P>
<P>
   And, as they must, many complaints simply come down to money
matters: lack of ads, stinted book tours, too little money put into
marketing. Why bother paying for a book if you're not going to
spend any money promoting it, making it work in the marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   Publishers' complaints journey between the weighty and the
perplexed, with a stopover at the absurd. Writers don't meet their
deadlines; they don't deliver the big dreams that were promised and
anticipated in the book's original proposal; the work has slacked
off from the author's previous book; some authors are just
recycling old situations, in essence just repeating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Editors are often bewildered when the author is not responsive
to their editing suggestions, their pleas to shorten or clarify
work and then become outraged when a reviewer says the book has
been poorly edited. (It must be noted here that a book is the
author's work, and should be published the way the author, not the
editor, wants it, even if that's not wise.) Writers don't always
have the material to substantiate blockbuster assertions in
nonfiction books.
</P>
<P>
   Writers refuse to accept the publishers' assertion that they try
as hard as they can to make their books work and that the writers'
own expectations might be out of whack with reality. (Hello!
Writers know that publishers have a pecking order, so authors are
not treated equally.)
</P>
<P>
   Publishers also complain that they are misunderstood, that their
writers simply don't accept the fact that Regis and Larry King are
competitors, and that if the writer is lucky enough to be booked on
one show she will not be on the other; that there are about 50,000
books published annually, and that a great many of those are
competing for the same air time and the same book review space.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many publishers' complaints border on the farcical. For
instance, they say that some writers gouge publishers on their book
tours by insisting on taking along a spouse or other companion at a
publisher's expense; other authors run up huge phone, food and bar
bills and demand limousines on tour.
</P>
<P>
   There are writers who try to press publishing houses into
publishing work by their significant others, which usually isn't
very good. One female writer always managed to cry during
interviews on tours, which didn't particularly bother the publisher
but she also brought on tears just as easily at business meetings
to get perks and that was vexing.
</P>
<P>
   This same author also refused to sign paperback books during a
book tour, insisting the fibers from the poorer quality paper
wafted up into her nasal passages. Which also made her cry.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is. A sampler list of outrages, some terrible and
some merely preposterous. But combatant as they can sometimes be,
writers and publishers do have one common complaint: Why can't
their latest work be on Oprah?

`PORT OF LAST RESORT': HOLOCAUST STORIES FROM SOME OF THE LUCKIER
ONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Early in ``Schindler's List,'' Steven Spielberg's
eloquent Holocaust film, an impeccably dressed couple _ he in a
bowler, she in a fur coat _ are thrown out of their grand Cracow
apartment and herded to the ghetto. After carrying their bags up
their new building's narrow stairs, they find a tiny apartment, a
crying baby and half a dozen other new occupants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be worse,'' says the wife in a faint voice, straining
for optimism. Her husband looks at her as if she's insane. ``Tell
me,'' he shouts, ``how on earth could it possibly be worse?''
</P>
<P>
   Even a 10-year-old seeing the movie could give him the terrible
answer to that question and warn him that he is certain to find out
soon. That's what makes the scene so painful. That is also what
makes Joan Grossman and Paul Rosdy's documentary ``The Port of Last
Resort'' less powerful than it might have been.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about the 20,000 or so European Jews who fled the
Nazis between 1939 and 1941 by going to Shanghai, where they found
less than a perfect new life. The filmmakers describe it as a story
of survival, but the narrative stresses the difficulties rather
than the strength of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival the immigrants were transported on trucks to a camp
of sorts, where they were served little more than noodle soup.
There was only a public bath. (One woman recalls almost being late
for her own wedding because it was the first time in months she'd
had a warm bath and she wanted to enjoy the luxury as long as she
could.)
</P>
<P>
   There were few jobs, so the unemployed men spent their days
playing cards and listening to the radio. Eventually the Japanese,
who took control of Shanghai in 1941, created a Jewish ghetto there
and thousands suffered great deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   This must have been a traumatizing experience for refugees of
all ages. Imagine the relief of escape and the hope of renewal,
only to find a new set of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``The Port of Last Resort'' making those
points, of course, is that its words and images _ refugees'
letters, home movies, archival footage and present-day interviews _
have to compete with harrowing scenes from a host of other
Holocaust films, fictional and documentary. The overwhelming tone
of this film, while appreciating the difficulties, should have been
about how lucky the survivors were. Wouldn't the inmates of the
German camps have loved to have problems like unemployment and
boredom?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to diminish the tremendous hardships the Shanghai
refugees endured, but their story might have better been told
through fiction, having one person or one family's story provide
the kind of emotional close-up that drives such experiences home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Port of Last Resort'' is being shown at Anthology Film
Archives with ``Memory of Berlin,'' John Burgan's well-meaning but
unsatisfying documentary about his search for his biological
parents. Unfortunately Burgan, who often sounds bored by his own
voice-over, describes his search in painfully obvious terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to that other baby, Matthew?'' he asks
rhetorically. (Matthew was the name his German mother gave him at
birth; his British adoptive parents named him John.) ``Nature or
nurture: the question every adoptee asks sooner or later,'' he
intones as if this were a new thought. But he draws no conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Burgan finds his birth mother and learns about his
father, these discoveries have less impact on screen than do his
home movies of childhood vacations.
</P>

A CAUTIOUS BRADLEY DOESN'T RULE OUT TAX HIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times news service clients)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ Whatever else he may be, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley said Wednesday he is no Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   Mondale, the vice president under Jimmy Carter and the
Democratic presidential nominee in 1984, doomed his campaign in a
debate withg$uesi &UR; 4:K/4:Ygan when he said that as president he
would raise taxes. Reagan, if re-elected, would end up doing the
same, Mondale said, but would not be frank about it. Reagan went on
to swamp Mondale and win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley refusing to rule out a tax increase to pay for his
ambitious universal health care proposal, the former New York
Knicks basketball star was shaping up as this election's Mondale in
the eyes of some Democratic strategists.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview on Wednesday, Bradley said it wasn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be Walter Mondale, I'd have to go to the American people
and say `I'm going to raise your taxes,''' Bradley said. ``That's
different than what I'm saying. I think there's going to be no need
for a tax increase because I think we're going to have sufficient
levels of economic growth'' that will pay the extra cost of
Bradley's health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``it would be irresponsible to say `no new
taxes,''' Bradley said. ``And that's my position. That's quite
different (from Mondale).''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's health care plan calls for universal coverage of all
uninsured children and adults through subsidies for those who
cannot afford insurance, as well as opening up the health plan for
federal employees to others. He estimated the annual cost of the
program at between $55 billion and $65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, had blasted the Bradley plan, saying it
would hurt more people than it would help and might lead to a tax
increase. Gore strategists reveled as Bradley seemed to tie himself
up in knots on whether he would _ or wouldn't _ raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore himself on Wednesday appeared to signal a retreat on
tax-bashing, saying in Washington that while he would not envision
a need for raising taxes while the economy remains solid, ``nobody
has a crystal ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley on Wednesday said that as a presidential candidate,
``you have to be honest with people and tell them what the reality
is out there. Who can predict what's going to happen in seven
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth undercuts the need for tax increases, Bradley
said. And in a recession, a tax cut is far preferable to a tax
hike, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, ``if you are in charge of a multitrillion
(dollar) economy,'' a ``no-new-taxes'' pledge would be
``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's avoidance of a pledge against tax increases ``means we're
in the same position,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to reporters at Montclair High School in the
affluent New York suburb where he lives, said his approach to the
presidency is to ``take this period of unprecedented prosperity and
use it in a way that strengthens the underlying productivity of the
country by making people better educated and healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``I think Gore is more cautious,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Saying there are 45 million with no health insurance and 35
million with inadequate insurance, ``I view this as a big problem
and I offer a big solution,'' Bradley said. Gore ``has been much
more cautious, simply throwing money at a failed system.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to account for the different approaches, Bradley said that
Gore ``might be so cautious because he doesn't want to change
anything. If you don't change, you don't grow. And you contract.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The status quo is a momentary moment. If you're not
moving forward, you're falling back. That might be where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's chief spokesman, Chris Lehane, said that as vice
president, ``it's been Al Gore on the court scoring points for
working families on the economy, the environment health care and
education.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lehane said, ``Sen. Bradley has been on the bench
or in the stands, watching all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley is competitive with Gore in New Hampshire,
which holds the nation's first primary on Feb. 1, he is well behind
Gore almost everywhere else, including California.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley insisted he has a shot in California, which holds its
primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a sense of California,'' Bradley said. ``The
very things I'm emphasizing in my campaign are important to
California, things like technological change, free and open trade,
environmental protection, diversity as a strength and not a
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Gore has won the endorsements of Gov. Gray Davis
and both senators, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Boxer. In
addition, 20 of the state's Democratic House members have endorsed
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bradley said, the campaign there will not get
under way in earnest until after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said in the interview that:
</P>
<P>
   _ He would not be interested in being Gore's running mate if the
vice president wins the nomination. Asked whether he would endorse
Gore as the nominee, Bradley said: ``I'm a Democrat so, sure, I
want a Democrat to win, not a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He opposes same-sex marriages, but is against a ballot
initiative in California that would bar any official recognition of
gay marriages performed in other states. ``It's divisive and it
contributes to stigmatization'' of gays. ``In a world where gay
bashing has increased, I'm not going to be a party to a thing that
leads to that kind of action.''
</P>
<P>
   _ He supports moves in many jurisdictions to give gay couples
the same legal and financial rights as married couples.

<P>
   Looking back at his long career as a basketball star and 18-year
veteran of the Senate, Bradley said voters ultimately would judge
him as a public servant, not a sports celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who knew me as a basketball and paid attention to my
work in the Senate didn't vote for me because I was a basketball
player,'' Bradley said. He won votes ``because of the work I was
doing, the vision I laid out for my state and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former player for the Knicks, ``I have nothing to apologize
for,'' he said. ``It was a great life.''

ENSHRINING THE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM OF A MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   Jerry Adler is a senior editor at Newsweek.  
 (bl)  
 By JERRY ADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As any archaeologist can tell you enviously, we live
now in a golden age of realia: the artifacts of daily life, the
clothes, tools, toys and decorations that are the unacknowledged
substrate of a civilization. In other words, a golden age of stuff,
not merely because we have so much more of it but because we invest
it with so much significance.
</P>
<P>
   As an intriguing new exhibition at the American Museum of
Natural History observes in passing, it is the realia of ancient
societies that captures our imagination these days. Who hasn't
wondered if Roman wines were really any good? Was it worse to live
in a hovel, or a yurt? What did people in the Middle Ages use for
diapers?
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Capturing Time: The New York Times Capsule,''
represents an effort to anticipate and answer precisely those types
of questions from citizens of the next millennium. While seeking
suggestions for objects to be entombed for the next 1,000 years,
the editors of The New York Times Magazine, which sponsored the
show and underwrote construction of the container, turned to
citizens of the archetypal suburban town of Fountain, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a sample on display at the museum, they did not
have to reach very far from where they were sitting to come up with
artifacts that evoked our civilization: cell phones and beepers,
Beanie Babies and barbed wire, a hood ornament from a Chevrolet and
a Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display through March 26 are the efforts of a number of
reporters and photographers, staff members of The Times and
freelancers, who canvassed New York at 9:09 a.m. on Sept. 9
(9/9/99) and found New Yorkers going about their predictable
rounds. One enterprising journalist snared for posterity a copy of
the lunch reservation list from the Four Seasons, proving that fame
of the sort achieved by, say, Barry Diller, might not be so
fleeting after all.
</P>
<P>
   There are some books _ ``Peyton Place'' and ``Go Tell It on the
Mountain,'' among others _ but the show implicitly acknowledges
what most visitors already know: that if you could choose one
volume to convey contemporary American culture, it probably would
not be a work of literature; it would be a Williams-Sonoma catalog.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Spam is Spam, and you may find yourself curiously
unmoved to come face to face with a can of the stuff destined to
spend the next 1,000 years immortalized in thermal-gel insulation
and argon gas. The more interesting part of the show is devoted to
the practical question of building a time capsule: How do you keep
it safe without burying it so far that it will never be found?
</P>
<P>
   It's worth the trip just to view the solution chosen by The
Times, a stainless-steel sculpture by the Spanish architect
Santiago Calatrava. His design is a highly mathematical, abstract
symmetrical form, likened to a flower or an origami, representing
time as what the artist calls ``crystallized movement.'' Its
curving hollows can be packed with about 50 cubic feet of objects
and data. Its contents will be chosen from among the objects in the
exhibition and from elsewhere before the capsule is sealed next
spring and put on permanent display on the museum grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Calatrava's design represented a novel approach to
avoiding the fate of most time capsules, which is to be sealed and
promptly forgotten. An object of great beauty, the editors felt,
would always command attention _ even if it is a pretty inefficient
shape for a container _ and future generations would be badly
misled if they concluded that the current civilization valued
beauty over efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists were invited to consider how to preserve and
identify time capsules, and their solutions make for provocative
viewing. Maya Lin suggested a granite slab in Central Park at the
center of a spiral of English oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   Jaron Lanier's electrifying proposal was to transcribe data into
a code based on the four molecular constituents of DNA, synthesize
the appropriate sequence and introduce it into the genome of a
cockroach. With an appropriate breeding program, he said, about
three gigabytes of data could be disseminated throughout New York
and preserved through enough cockroach generations to take it into
the fourth millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Why not use life? The tiny double helix has outlasted the
mightiest mountains. Only yards away from ``Capturing Time'' are
the museum's great halls of the dinosaurs. They left us only bones
and footprints, but those are still around after 100 million years.
Even preserved in argon gas and stainless steel, does anyone think
Furbies will do as well?

 &HT;    Changes deflate Florida county's Bible course
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ As a high school elective here, the Bible
just can't compete with home economics or shop.
</P>
<P>
   Brought forward by Christian activists, a controversial Bible
class similar to the one that will be debated today by the Georgia
Board of Education was offered in January 1998. More than 150
students enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   But the day before the class started, a federal court blocked
Lee County's original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   What's left in this Gulf Coast community is a course based on a
college textbook written by a Stetson University professor.
</P>
<P>
   The case remains the legal watermark for districts that want to
incorporate Bible courses into their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But just 23 months after all eight of Lee County's public high
schools offered the class, no one is teaching it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Not enough students signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Some seniors don't want to risk their grade-point averages by
taking a college-level course, which the Bible class is, said
Douglas Whittaker, executive director of curriculum for the Lee
County school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is, `I'm going to take ceramics,'''
Whittaker said. ``This wasn't a Sunday school class. This was a
rigorous academic class.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more critical in the enrollment drop-off has been the
court-mandated recording of the courses. Watchdog groups monitor
the video and audio tapes, making sure instructors don't stray into
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students were just very uncomfortable taking a class that was
under glass like that,'' said Mike McNerney, principal at Mariner
High School, the last school in the county that taught Introduction
to the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the course really ever had a chance because it
was political in nature,'' McNerney said, ``and that spelled defeat
from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Board of Education member Bruce Jackson has said
state School Superintendent Linda Schrenko and others gain
political capital from the Bible proposal, ``whether we approve it
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lehigh Senior High, across the county in this southwest
Florida community, Principal Pete Folaros said the history
instructor who volunteered to teach the class felt apprehensive
because of community scrutiny. Reached Wednesday, the teacher
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he might face personal damages,'' Folaros said.
``Even though the district would go to bat for him'' there was no
guarantee a teacher might not become the subject of a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The issue first surfaced in 1996 when a citizens group asked for
a high school Bible course. The five-member school board approved
the idea 3-2, creating a committee to design a legally acceptable
Bible class.
</P>
<P>
   The committee met for 1 1/2 years but fractured into two groups:
a minority that favored a secular presentation of biblical events
and a majority that advocated material from the North
Carolina-based National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public
Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Local Christian activists supported the North Carolina material.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevic barred the
group's New Testament course because it might violate
constitutional bans against teaching religion in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kovachevic, in her ruling, expressed constitutional reservations
over the presentation of Christ's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judge, ``the only reasonable interpretation of
the Resurrection is a religious interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   School districts debating Bible courses should tread cautiously
in light of what's happened in Fort Myers, advised Whittaker, the
Lee County curriculum chief.
</P>
<P>
   Kovachevic ``is very conservative and tends to align herself
with the political right _ and she found that curriculum
untenable,'' Whittaker said. ``You're probably going to end up in
court if you choose to use it. It's a prescription for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, two years after the debate started, Bible class
opponents spent $14,000 on election advertising and voted out two
school board members who supported the North Carolina curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves just one school board member who favors the more
evangelical course.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described Christian conservative Lanny Moore, a member of
the committee that recommended the original class material, was
elected to the Lee County school board after it approved the idea
of a Bible course.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said most of the committee's time was spent arguing over
whether a class should be taught at all. He's distressed the North
Carolina curriculum was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any vestiges of the Christian influence basically has been
expunged from the social studies and history classes in our
district,'' Moore said. ``If you can't teach history as it happened
in an academic setting, where can you teach it? You can't teach
Christianity, and you can't allude to it. Where's your academic
freedom?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Wayne Robinson, whose Unitarian Universalist Church of
Fort Myers was a primary opponent of the course, argued that the
material originally proposed was little more than an extended
Sunday school class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate in the media made it seem like an issue of faith,''
Robinson said. ``I really think it was misunderstanding of our
Constitution. ... We respect all religions and minorities. But
we're not to establish a religion.''

BRAZIL WIZARD MAKES BOOKS DISAPPEAR FROM STORES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Paulo Coelho was visiting Spain last
summer when a reporter back home in Brazil called with a piece of
news that made it clear to him that the audience for his books no
longer knows any bounds: The president of the United States had
just been photographed reading ``The Alchemist,'' the best known of
Coelho's slender fables of spiritual growth and fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, something in Coelho's deceptively spare and direct
style must appeal to world leaders, since Jacques Chirac of France
has just named him a knight of the Legion of Honor, and Boris
Yeltsin and Shimon Peres are also admirers. But over the last five
years Coelho's ability to speak to ordinary readers has made him a
global publishing phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the French magazine Lire rated Coelho the
second most popular author in the world last year, selling more
books than any other writer except John Grisham. The nine titles to
Coelho's credit, which include novels, parables that read like a
mixture of Khalil Gibran and Carlos Castaneda, and autobiographical
tales of faith and mystery, have been translated into 43 languages
and, at last count, had sold 26.3 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that some of Coelho's dedicated readers believe
he really is a wizard with magical powers, an image he has
cultivated in books like ``The Pilgrimage'' and ``The Valkyries.''
The French magazine in fact gave him the nickname Big Chief of the
Spiritual. In the world's most affluent publishing market, this
slim and agile 52-year-old finds that ``I am not very well known in
the United States,'' even after the boost from Clinton and
celebrity endorsements from Julia Roberts and Madonna. ``But I know
I am widely read there,'' he said in an interview at his apartment
overlooking Copacabana beach.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho (pronounced co-AIL-you) credits the publication of ``The
Alchemist'' in English in 1993 with starting his international
career. The story of Santiago, a Spanish shepherd boy who journeys
to the pyramids of Egypt in search of his destiny, or ``personal
legend,'' to use Coelho's preferred term, ``The Alchemist'' was an
immediate best seller upon publication here in 1988 but did not
initially attract much attention beyond Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the publishing world outside of the United States, nobody
reads Spanish, much less Portuguese,'' he said, adding that the
attitude of publishers in Europe and elsewhere was that even though
he had sold six million books here in his home country, ``those are
Brazilian numbers, just a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to establish a presence in the United States, he said.
``To have a book published in more than 119 countries, you need to
have a language that can be read in Thailand or Lithuania,'' he
continued. ``Translation into English made it possible for other
editors to read me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that door opened, Coelho has helped himself by insisting
that, no matter what the country, his books be priced accessibly
and handled by a local publisher, a step that has spurred his sales
in places like India. And with a yen for travel that dates back to
his days as a hippie, he does not hesitate to go off the beaten
track to promote his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I come from a country that is excluded, that doesn't
see authors of big best sellers come here, I've made a point of
going to the places where no one else goes, like Bulgaria,
Macedonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Slovakia, Iceland,'' he said. ``All my
life the most important things have been what I learned from
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's most recent novel, ``Veronika Decides to Die,'' to be
published in the United States in May, was born of just such an
excursion. It is set in a mental hospital in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
and tells the story of a bright and beautiful young woman who seems
to have a golden future but concludes that life has no meaning and
tries to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to write a book about a person with an identity
crisis living in a country with an identity crisis,'' the former
Yugoslavia, he said. The point of the novel, which is a best seller
all over Europe and Latin America this fall, ``is to say to such
people that you are not alone and you are not crazy,'' he
continued, and that ``everyone wonders, what am I doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Coelho's books, ``Veronika'' draws heavily on his
personal experience. When he was a teen-ager, his parents had him
committed three times to a mental institution here. He displayed
copies of the medical papers, which indicate that he twice fled the
hospital where he was being treated for ``irritation and
hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's early adulthood was nearly as turbulent. He used drugs
heavily, he said, dabbled in the black magic doctrines of Aleister
Crowley and was imprisoned three times and tortured by the
right-wing military government then in power here, which suspected
that the ``alternative society'' he and his hippie friends were
advocating concealed a Communist conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   None of his books have been set in Brazil, and for one reason.
``I am deeply accustomed to Brazil, so my eyes do not have the
innocence to write about Brazil, the innocence to be able to see
new things,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even when he writes a book set in Spain, the Middle East
or the Balkans, ``I write as a Brazilian,'' he said. ``You know
that here there is not so much separation between what is magical
and what is real.'' His two favorite writers are Jorge Luis Borges
and Carlos Castaneda; he said they shared a common thread: blurring
the distinction between the real and the imaginary, something he
also strives to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's books, however, have often been treated harshly by
critics, both here and abroad. One, writing in the Brazilian
newsmagazine Veja, dismissed his ouevre by saying, ``I haven't read
it, and I don't like it.'' But Juan Arias, author of ``Paulo
Coelho: The Confessions of the Pilgrim,'' a biography published in
Portuguese and Spanish this year, argues that such attacks miss the
point of what Coelho and his work are really about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the final judges have to be readers and not
critics, and the readers have delivered their verdict,'' said
Arias, a former editor of the cultural supplement of the Madrid
daily El Pais. ``His way of writing is not typical, but he knows
how to address that part of us that you can call childlike or
paradoxical, and in that sense he is a great communicator.''

 &HT;    MORE TEACHER CHEATING EXPECTED IN THE FUTURE
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many more school systems will erupt in testing
scandals like the one just uncovered in New York, friends and foes
of high-stakes testing agreed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After a 17-month probe of how state-mandated tests were given in
the the nation's largest school system, special investigator Ed
Stanick recommended action Wednesday against 52 educators. All were
suspended, giving school officials time to consider his
recommendation that two principals and 10 teachers be fired and
another 40 disciplined for using illegal or unethical methods to
raise their students' test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Those methods used included verbal hints to students by teachers
using lists of answers, and the erasure and correction of some
incorrect answers. The vast majority of the city's 70,000 teachers
and principals were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   New York uses test scores not just to judge how much students
know, but how good a job is being done by their school and by the
principals and teachers. Every state except Iowa has decided to
require all its public schools to administer at least some
standardized academic exams.
</P>
<P>
   They are called ``high-stakes'' tests because the scores can
affect both staff members' pay and assignments and students' hopes
for promotion or graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the latest and apparently biggest so far in a growing
trend of cheating to raise test scores,'' said Robert Schaefer of
Sanibel, Fla., spokesman for FairTest, an organization skeptical of
standardized testing.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to other scattered accusations of cheating by
educators in a few classrooms in Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Virginia, Ohio, Arizona, Maryland and Texas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's likely to accelerate,'' Schaefer said.
``When the test score is all that matters in evaluating educational
quality, too many teachers will produce the scores they need by
hook or by crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials deny that cheating is widespread. They
said that probes of some suspect results determined that almost all
testing errors were due to mistakes or carelessness, rather than an
intent to distort the results.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, parents and the public need the tests in order to hold
schools accountable for results, said educational psychologist John
R. Stone of East Tennessee State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainly there are strong pressures on schools to do well on
exams _ and there should be,'' Stone said. ``The cheating is not an
argument for lessening the emphasis upon accountability, but for
having tighter controls on the tests.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   States could hire outsiders to give the tests, Stone said. If
that is too expensive, random test sites and results could be
``sampled by people who are entirely independent of the schools,''
Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanick's report said some New York educators cheated as
blatantly as those involved in a recent scandal in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the other behavior was of the more ambiguous kind
spotted in many school districts in recent years. In one survey of
Kentucky teachers, one-third said that they sometimes offer hints,
recommend that wrong answers be revised or rephrase questions on
exams.
</P>

   ``It's easy to envision a a teacher (in the lower grades) who
spends her whole day helping students, glancing at a test answer
and saying 'Now, Johnny, you know we've talked about this
before','' said Mark Musick of Atlanta, president of the Southern
Regional Education Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, if you have more high-stakes testing, you are going to
have the statistical probability that you'll have someone somewhere
cheating,'' Musick said. ``But there are processes and precautions
that could identify this, just as they did a few years ago in North
Carolina, and apparently just did again in New York.''

 RIO DE JANEIRO: great communicator.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For his part Coelho complains more about booksellers who insist
on placing his works in their New Age or self-help sections rather
than on the fiction shelves. He does not gripe much, though, about
the critical hammering he often receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the critics are right when they say my style seems
simple and superficial,'' he said. ``I am an extremely direct
person. I dry up the language to the maximum precisely to be able
to let the reader play with his imagination. But I preserve the
symbolism that is beyond the words. That is the language of the
future, and I am its vanguard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I write a first draft, I tend to overexplain, because I
feel insecure, because I'm not telling the story well,'' he said.
``So the rest is cutting, cutting, cutting. Instead of describing a
desert landscape with all its rocks, I will just say, `They were in
a desert.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to write `Ulysses,' but if you ask people if
anyone has read all of `Ulysses,' no one has,'' he continued.
``Joyce has become the parameter of a whole academic system for the
20th century, so when I come along with this more direct language,
of course I am going to provoke a reaction. I am not writing in
accordance with the establishment, but I am certain that in a few
years my language will prevail, because it is a modern language.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in his homeland Coelho first came to attention in the early
1970s not as a novelist but as a pop music lyricist, writing more
than 70 songs with the rock star Raul Seixas, described by Coelho
as ``the Jim Morrison of Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter experience in the record business that set
Coelho on the road to writing fiction. He was an executive for CBS
Records, now Sony, when he was unexpectedly fired in an office
purge and, with ``the money I had saved up from publishing
royalties'' and nothing better to do, decided to travel.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in his life, ``my rite of passage,'' he said,
came when he underwent the trial of walking the medieval Road to
Santiago in Spain, an experience recounted in the book that was
initially titled ``The Diary of a Magus'' and is now called ``The
Pilgrimage.'' His true spiritual home, he concluded afterward, was
a mystical brand of the Roman Catholicism in which he had been
raised and which now suffuses his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be a good Catholic, but I am not a Catholic writer,
like Graham Greene, for example, or as they tried to make Morris
West out to be,'' he said. His multilingual Web site
(paulocoelho.com) includes Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim texts
and images.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Catholicism is the best religion, but it is the
religion that is in my roots,'' he said. ``I believe in God, that I
am not here by chance, and that since I am here, I should do
something. I no longer have to ask, `What am I doing here?'''

COMMENTARY: VICTIMS OF THE `GREAT GAME' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The newly emboldened Russian military has now
embarked on a modern version of what Rudyard Kipling in 1901 called
``the Great Game'' _ that struggle against the West for economic
and political power in the Caucasus and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   A war on terrorism out of Chechnya is its excuse. Next week's
elections to the Russian Parliament are the immediate cause of the
systematic massacre of the dark-skinned Muslim troublemakers. The
blood-thirstiest of the Russian politicians are getting the most
support, if we can believe the easily rigged polls.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another, longer-range game afoot. That is the old
imperialist urge by Moscow to dominate the sources and lines of
supply of Caspian Basin and Iranian oil and gas, and thereby to
gain a stranglehold on the economic life of its adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   A map tells the story. Chechnya lies astride one of the key
pipelines into Russia and out to a Black Sea port through Turkey's
Bosporus to the Mediterranean. That's why Moscow says it must be
denied independence, no matter how many die.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, aware of Russia's ambitions, is encouraging
an alternative to supply lines through Iran, Iraq and Russia. We
support a proposed energy trail through Azerbaijan, Georgia and
Turkey. Although it has not happened, President Clinton said
Wednesday it would be seen as ``one of the most important things
that happened this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is putting great pressure on Georgia, independent after
the breakup of the Soviet Union. Adjacent to Chechnya, Georgia has
been resisting occupation by Russian troops who want to take charge
of its border; that would undermine the West's proposed pipeline.
Georgia's reformist president, Eduard Shevardnadze, has survived
three assassination attempts that many think were KGB-inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow recently entertained Tariq Aziz, Saddam Hussein's man. In
return for Russia's support in resisting U.N. inspection of its
nuclear weapon development, Iraq has cut its permitted production
of oil. That has helped drive up the price of oil _ it has doubled
this year _ and has given Russia the money it needs to support
100,000 troops in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the undercurrent events. On the surface, residents of
besieged Grozny, the Chechen capital, have been ordered to get out
of town lest they be pulverized by bombs this weekend _ but no
cease-fire was offered to let them get out safely. Thousands will
die along with relatively few terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   One Baltic leader said this was like answering the terrorist
hijacking of an aircraft by shooting down the plane. Clinton
sternly warned that such slaughter of civilians would mean ``Russia
will pay a heavy price for those actions.''
</P>
<P>
   What price? Only that its threatened atrocity ``will further
alienate the global community from Russia.'' What a weak-kneed
response. The time to list the consequences is before the massacre.
Such as:
</P>
<P>
   1. Disinvite the Russians from next week's scheduled meeting of
the Group of 8 foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dispatch a trade-and-aid delegation to Georgia immediately.
</P>
<P>
   3. Describe the suspension of the next IMF loan to Russia for
what it is _ retaliation for atrocity _ and has little to do with
reasons that save Russia's face.
</P>
<P>
   4. Withdraw our scheduled Export-Import Bank guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   5. Point out how Arab oil producers, now paying lip service to
their Muslim brethren in Chechnya, are financing Russia's attack
with their OPEC-induced shortages and inflated oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   6. Begin drawing down oil from our brimming strategic reserve,
replenishing the reserve when world prices drop.
</P>
<P>
   7. Move quickly to bring the Baltic states into NATO. Russian
imperialism is still alive and growling.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has a way of responding to credible threats. What
happened when John McCain and George W. Bush made plain they would
withdraw from the ABM treaty if the Russians refused necessary
modifications to allow limited missile defense? Russia's Duma,
after four years, decided to take up ratification of Start II.
</P>
<P>
   Cluck-clucking and hand-wringing have no effect. Mass killing is
no game, great or otherwise. Diplomatic and economic pressure can
save lives.

LIV ULLMANN DIRECTS A BERGMAN TALE OF TWISTS AND ENTANGLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM _ ``His secrets are his secrets,'' the actress, author
and director Liv Ullmann said of the complicated inner life of
Ingmar Bergman, the 81-year-old Swedish director. ``What we have to
do is use our own experiences, our own lives, our own secrets and
our perceptions of Bergman to make the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie in question is ``The Faithless,'' and it is a project
thick with the pain and unresolved emotion of love and loss, in
life as well as fiction. Bergman wrote the script, about a doomed
love affair that has haunted him for more than five decades, but it
is Ms. Ullmann, his former lover and a woman who says she knows him
as well as anyone in the world, who is bringing it to life as
director.
</P>
<P>
   The personal tangles don't end there. The Swedish actors Lena
Endre and Thomas Hanzon, who have long worked in the theater under
Bergman's direction and who in the film portray a couple whose
marriage is destroyed by her affair, were married to each other
until about two years ago. They are now divorced and each has a new
partner, but there is no denying the pain of their shared past.
</P>
<P>
   If the swirling emotions aren't complicated enough, ``The
Faithless,'' which is to be released in the next year, is full of
enough darkness and moral agonizing to satisfy any Bergman
enthusiast. With Ms. Ullmann as director, it is perhaps a less
despairing film that it would have been if directed by Bergman
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's darker than I am; he's more pessimistic,'' Ms. Ullmann
said over a recent lunch of grilled salmon and spring water in a
cafeteria near the studio in Stockholm where some of the interior
scenes were filmed. ``But sometimes it's sunny where he sees rain.
I am truly hopeful that he's going to be happy with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of ``The Faithless'' takes place in the office of an
elderly film director, meant to be a stand-in for Bergman himself,
who sits at his desk, struggling to write about a disastrous affair
from his past with a woman who has long since died. He is
interrupted by the sudden arrival of an actress, played by Ms.
Endre _ it is left ambiguous whether she is a product of his
fantasies or is real _ who takes up the story as if it had happened
to her, as if she is the woman from long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then the scene shifts to the past, and the narrative reveals
that all the protagonists in the fraught affair _ husband, wife and
lover _ are faithless, to themselves and to one another. The movie
is meant to show how moments of passion can yield years of
unhappiness, and its themes are utterly recognizable to all
involved in the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why the script is so fascinating,'' said Krister
Henriksson, the ruggedly handsome Swede who plays the Bergman-esque
lover in the film. ``This is a specific event in Ingmar's life, but
everybody has had similar things in one way or another in our own
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Henriksson spoke on a day in November when Ms. Ullmann was
directing a pivotal scene, in which the lover confronts the wife.
Emotions on the set were raw, but Henriksson, 53, was calm as he
munched on various kinds of Swedish crackers during a break from
his dramatic tete-a-tete with Ms. Endre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the name `Faithless': in one way that is what all actors
and directors are,'' Henriksson said. ``When you're doing a
production, it's a kind of love affair, and then you go away and
it's over. Of course sometimes you mix the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Henriksson has done his share of mixing work and love in the
past. (``I did it, and I had to get a divorce,'' he said.) So has
Ms. Endre. But both said that the project served as a sharp
reminder about the perils of being too carried away to remember
your responsibilities, especially to your children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been married twice and have two children, and I'm
familiar with all these problems,'' said Ms. Endre, 44, who is one
of Sweden's best-known actresses, having appeared extensively in
films, on television and at the Royal Dramatic Theater in
Stockholm. ``You think, `Is it really worth it to follow all this
passion?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, she said, would have to be no. ``I've had my
affairs, and I'm never going to have an affair again,'' Ms. Endre
said.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it was to work with her former husband in a film
whose story loosely parallels their own experience, Ms. Endre said,
the film has helped lay to rest some of the issues remaining
between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friends, and that is the most important thing,'' she
said. ``It's been good in some ways, because we know each other so
well. Maybe it's helped us to talk through difficult things that we
didn't talk through before.''
</P>
<P>
   What of Bergman?
</P>
<P>
   The great director _ whose passions, doubts and moral wrestlings
have been well explored in movies like ``Scenes From a Marriage,''
``Autumn Sonata,'' ``Wild Strawberries'' and ``Cries and Whispers''
_ spent the fall directing a film for Swedish television and is now
preparing a production of ``Mary Stuart'' for the Royal Dramatic
Theater. He made a point, Ms. Ullmann said, of not interfering with
her vision of ``The Faithless.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullmann is about to turn 61, and much of her adulthood has
been tied up with Bergman. They lived together in his house on a
remote island off the coast of Sweden for five years, when she was
in her early 20s and he was in his early 40s, and they had a
daughter, Linn. Ms. Ullmann has also worked with the director for
decades, appearing in a number of his films, and knows how he feels
and how he thinks, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are his private confessions,'' Ms. Ullmann said of
Bergman's script. ``But he has given only lines. We have to read
what we will into the lines. I have built on my knowledge of him,
knowing him so well as a writer and director, as a father, as a
friend, as an enemy and as a lover. And then I build on my own
knowledge as a woman, as someone who's had love affairs and broken
up from love affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is as much about multiple points of view, about seeing
things from someone else's perspective, as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the story from before,'' Ms. Ullmann said of Bergman's
love affair, which took place long before she met him. ``But if I
sat down with you and told it to you, and he sat down with you, you
would get a very different story. I think he's been very brave
about this. I think maybe he wanted it to be seen from another
perspective. He's curious about other people. He's a cannibal. He
wants to see things _ in the good and bad sense _ from other
people's points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion in the film is presented as urgent, reckless and
all-consuming. ``The moment he falls in love with her, it's
forever,'' Ms. Ullmann said. ``He gives himself to her, skin,
heart, everything. He gives himself 100 percent, even more than she
does, because she has to think of her husband and daughter. But
he's free, as Bergman has always been free, to love. When love
comes, it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Ullmann forgiveness is all-important. ``It never ends
well when you hurt a lot of people, but in their own ways they ask
for forgiveness,'' she said of the characters in the film. Though
she made it clear that she did not mean to speak for Bergman, who
declined to be interviewed, she added that perhaps the movie was
his way of seeking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel is that I allow the people in the movie to forgive
each other in one way or another,'' she said. ``You can be forgiven
as long as you find a reason to say I'm sorry, somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   If the film is about the heartbreaks of the past, it is also
about an old man's terrible realization that the exquisite pain of
such heartbreaks will never come to him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you grow older, you're face to face with yourself,'' Ms.
Ullmann said. ``This is the older Bergman looking back at things he
experienced long ago but won't experience again, because his body
isn't the same, his eyes aren't the same, his skin isn't the same.
He's not the same. Deep down you long to experience it once more,
to have your heart go that way once more, to have your body go that
way once more. And it's not going to happen, because you're totally
alone.''

GERMANY REFUSES TO BUDGE ON SIZE OF FUND FOR NAZI-ERA SLAVE
LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ With negotiations at an impasse over a
German fund to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder dismissed demands to improve Germany's
latest offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now an issue for the lawyers,'' Schroeder said in a
television interview Wednesday, ruling out any increase in the
joint offer by German corporations and the government of 8 billion
marks or $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Lambsdorff, Germany's lead negotiator, said German
companies may in fact start withdrawing from the proposed
settlement and striking deals on their own.
</P>
<P>
   German corporations, hoping to avoid protracted court battles
and negative publicity in the United States, have been negotiating
with American lawyers and Jewish organizations for months and
seemed to be near an agreement just three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 of Germany's biggest industrial companies and banks
have offered to put up about 5.5 billion marks and the German
government has agreed to put up another 2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But in class action suits, American Jewish groups and lawyers
are demanding about 10 billion marks, which amounts to about $1
billion more than the current offer.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were supposed to meet for what many had hoped
would be a final round of talks in Washington on Wednesday. But the
talks were canceled when it became clear they would not agree.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, who has acted
as a moderator in the talks, refused to comment Wednesday. But in a
speech earlier this week at the Council on Foreign Relations, he
said it would be a ``tragedy'' if talks collapsed over a difference
of just $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides say it is still possible to reach a deal
before the end of the year. ``Ironically, the two sides are closer
than they have ever been before,'' said Elan Steinberg, executive
director of the World Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Informal discussions and telephone calls continue to take place,
and both sides are under pressure to reach agreement. Groups
representing Holocaust survivors fear that a long court battle
would delay compensation until after many have died.
</P>
<P>
   German corporations, meanwhile, want to avoid an avalanche of
bad publicity as well as potentially enormous verdicts handed down
by American courts.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder began seeking a resolution almost as soon as he was
elected chancellor about one year ago. Reversing the hard-line
stance of his predecessor, Helmut Kohl, Schroeder agreed to the
government contributing alongside industry to a fund that would
compensate people forced to work in German factories by the Hitler
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that about 250,000 slave laborers _
concentration camp prisoners forced to work without pay _ are still
alive today. But as many as two million other workers, most of them
shipped in from central and eastern Europe, were forced to work as
well under varying conditions of pay.
</P>
<P>
   People involved with the negotiations say the two sides are in
general agreement about how the fund should allocate money. They
have also narrowed their differences over its size, with American
lawyers retreating from their original demands of 20 billion marks
or more.
</P>
<P>
   American groups have suggested they will accept an offer of 10
billion marks. German corporations have thus far refused to budge.
They also complain that American negotiators have not fully assured
them that they would be free from any future claims if they sign
this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hundreds of companies that used forced labor
during the Nazi era still refuse to join the fund. In addition to
scores of mid-sized and smaller German companies, they also include
American corporations like Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.,
which has owned the German car company Adam Opel AG for more than
60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, including Ford and GM, have argued that they
simply lost control of their companies during the war. Others argue
that they are legally different companies and merely carry the
names of those that operated during the war.

OUSTED PAKISTANI PREMIER IS FORMALLY CHARGED IN ANTI-TERROR COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan _ Prosecutors on Wednesday formally charged
the ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and six others with
hijacking, kidnapping, attempted murder and plotting to wage war
against the state.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in a special anti-terrorism court then scheduled a
hearing for Monday, when he will probably accept pleas and set a
trial date. If convicted, Sharif and the others could face the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We barely know what is happening to us,'' the deposed prime
minister said weakly after asking Judge Shabbir Ahmed for a chance
to address the court at the end of the session. ``We have been kept
totally out of touch. It is a travesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was clean-shaven and dressed in a well-pressed suit and
gray waistcoat. But he complained that he was still being kept in
solitary confinement in a cramped cell, even after the court
ordered improved quarters last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My room is barely able to accommodate a small bed, there is
not even room for a prayer mat,'' he said, adding that he has been
unable to meet with his lawyers, his wife or even his younger
brother Shahbaz, a co-defendant who is being held in the same jail
</P>
<P>
   Under Pakistani law, Sharif, as a dignitary, is entitled to what
is known as a ``superior class'' cell that has more space and a
television.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed asked a prosecutor, Raja Qureshi, why better facilities
had not been provided. Dissatisfied with the answers, he warned
that if the defendants again complained of mistreatment, he would
``depute a commission'' to inspect the lockup.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second testy exchange between the judge and
Qureshi, the first being about the prosecution's failure to provide
transcripts of vital audio tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the defendants stems from the circumstances of
the coup on Oct. 12. The prime minister is accused of trying to
prevent the safe landing of a commercial jet that was en route to
Karachi and carrying Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army chief of staff
whom Sharif had dismissed hours earlier. Musharraf has cited the
incident as the reason for the military's takeover of the
government that day.
</P>
<P>
   Key evidence in the case are tapes said to contain Sharif's
orders to the air control tower. The plane, with 198 aboard, was
allowed to touch down in Karachi only after the army seized control
of the airport. The aircraft, according to prosecutors, was by then
so dangerously low of fuel that a catastrophe was avoided by mere
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot have a fair trial if you expect to take the
defendants by surprise with evidence,'' Ahmed said, chastising
Qureshi about the missing transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-terrorism courts were set up last year by Sharif
himself. He had been dissatisfied with by sluggish judicial
proceedings in many high-profile cases. The new system could
shorten the time from arrest to execution to a matter of months _
or even weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted prime minister now faces his own rapid-fire
jurisprudence, though the prosecution itself found several reasons
to delay the filing of formal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, another delay was caused when the government changed
the law for anti-terrorism trial, requiring that a high court judge
preside.
</P>
<P>
   On trial along with the ousted prime minister are his brother
Shahbaz, the former chief minister of Sindh province; Saifur

 &HT;    TVA to produce key atomic bomb material
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Agreeing to turn plowshares into swords, so to speak,
the Tennessee Valley Authority directors Wednesday voted to approve
a contract to manufacture a key component for atomic bombs at the
Watts Bar nuclear power plant in southwest Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first time in U.S. history that a commercial
reactor will be used to produce material for nuclear bombs.
Tritium, the ``H'' in H-bombs, is a hydrogen isotope that greatly
enhances the explosive power of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   TVA officials defended their agreement to provide the material
to the U.S. Department of Energy as nothing more than a
continuation of the federal utility's long history of assisting in
U.S. defense projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provided power to the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge and we
provided power to a munitions plant in Alabama during World War
II,'' said TVA spokesman John Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Project produced the atomic bombs dropped on Japan
in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-nuclear activists contend the decision to use a
nonmilitary reactor hurts America's standing in the effort to
curtail nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On what grounds do we now have to tell other nations like
Iraq, Iran, India and Pakistan that they shouldn't blend their
weapons programs with their civilian programs?'' asked Mary Olson
of the Nuclear Information Resource Center's Southeast office in
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   No other nation is officially known to be using commercial
reactors to make bomb materials. Olson said evidence has surfaced
that Pakistan utilized plutonium from power plants to build bombs,
and an article in Jane's Intelligence Review last year suggested
India obtained tritium for its nuclear tests from a commercial
reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bailey, a TVA vice president for engineering who headed the
yearlong contract negotiations, said the agency relied on a report
prepared for the White House by various federal agencies and issued
in 1998 that concluded that the deal did not violate any
international laws or treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the issue is touchy with American allies.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign nations that export uranium to the U.S.,
including Canada and Australia, are forbidden to sell the fuel if
it is used to make bombs. Therefore, TVA was forced to contract
with the sole U.S. source for enriched uranium fuel to power the
Watts Bar reactor, said Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   Because tritium decays fairly rapidly, it must be periodically
replenished in nuclear warheads. The DOE has not manufactured the
isotope in several years because of the 1988 shutdown of its
notoriously flawed reactors at the Savannah River Site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this material to maintain the safety, security and
reliability of the nuclear stockpile,'' said Matthew Donoghue, a
DOE spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   DOE estimates it will need new tritium by 2005, meaning the
first tritium-producing rods would need to be inserted into the
reactor by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the contract, DOE will pay TVA $25 million to
make ``things ready'' for the project and then pay as much as $10
million annually for tritium production, said TVA's Moulton.
</P>
<P>
   While Watts Bar will be the primary source of tritium, the
contract allows TVA to shift production to its Sequoyah station
near Chattanooga if necessary.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After years of negotiations _ and, many say, calculated
delay _ Russia and Belarus agreed in principle on Wednesday to form
an economic and political confederation modeled roughly after the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But even after a glittering Kremlin ceremony to confirm the
accord, and the official predictions that the union could lead to a
larger and revitalized Slavic alliance, it seemed doubtful that
Russian leaders would carry out many of the alliance's grand
designs soon, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, hinted as much
after the ceremony. ``Nothing obstructs the setting up of a
union-state but the lack of will on the part of the Russian
leadership,'' he said at a news conference. ``When there is a will,
we will resolve all the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko and Russian President Boris Yeltsin said they expect
their parliaments to ratify the so-called Union Treaty immediately.
Leaders of the Russian Parliament said they would take up the
document at a special session on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Without waiting for that, Lukashenko and Yeltsin announced a
sheaf of related initiatives, chief among them the creation of a
joint army district stretching from Moscow to the border separating
Belarus from Ukraine and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko, a frequent and bitter critic of the United States
and NATO, said the new district's goal would be to defend against
an invasion from the West, and he suggested that the issue of
returning Russian nuclear weapons to Belarus was open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, however, said the confederation would keep the two
nations separate and was not aimed at any particular nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly eight years ago, at a lodge in a national forest
in Belarus near the border with Poland, that Yeltsin and leaders of
other major Soviet republics signed an accord asserting their
governments' right to become independent of communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Belavezh treaty was the death blow to the Soviet Union,
which was officially dissolved three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, speaking clearly but briefly becoming unsteady as he
fumbled with cards bearing his remarks, called the unification pact
``a remarkable day in the centuries-old history of the fraternal
peoples.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts almost uniformly disagreed. They said the Kremlin
largely sought the treaty ceremony as a flag-waving boost to its
candidates in mid-December parliamentary elections. The agreement
also sends a message to the West that Russia has no intention of
ceding still more influence on its western flank to Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Substantively, though, the union treaty is long on flourishes
and all but devoid of political union, at least anytime soon. In
many respects, it differs little from an earlier statement of
principles the two men signed in early 1996.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The treaty envisions two independent nations, first developing
common tax, customs and other economic codes, and then, by 2005 or
so, a common currency, defense policy and other laws.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Russia and Belarus would be citizens of the new
state, but retain their current citizenship and governments. A new
parliament and executive council would oversee unspecified joint
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a long way off. Even with quick ratification,
legislative changes might not begin until 2001, and major
integration would require constitutional changes which, in Russia,
are by no means assured.
</P>
<P>
   The pact also poses internal political dangers. The treaty
signing prompted some Russian republics like Tatarstan _ now
regarded as ordinary provinces _ to warn that they will want the
same economic benefits and independent status as Belarus should the
confederation be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen, the treaty would have sped the dissolution
of the Russian Federation rather than the expanded influence it
envisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, a merger of the two states is not
in the offing,'' said Dimitri Tenin, the deputy director of the
Moscow office of the Carnegie Institute. ``We can have a union
treaty, we can have a unified council of ministers, or what have
you. But those will remain ceremonial bodies without any actual
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko is the driving force behind the union treaty. A
barely reconstructed Communist, he favors rebuilding a new Russian
colossus _ and, few doubt, eventually leading it from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has stumped in at least 16 Russian provinces,
preaching a politics of resentment over lost Soviet greatness that
won him a landslide victory in 1994 elections in Belarus.

BUSH: `I'VE BEEN UNDERESTIMATED BEFORE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. - Dan Halpin climbed the hill to the bright white
town hall with a heavy heart and question for a man he admires _
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin, a bookseller and Republican, asked the Texas governor
and national frontrunner in the race for the GOP nomination, how it
is that he has gained the label as ``not intellectually curious.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than react defensively to yet another question about
his intellectual preparedness for the presidency, Bush seized the
opportunity to address a concern that continues to fester after two
uneven debate performances in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be underestimated than overestimated,'' Bush said,
flashing a lopsided grin, then summoning the memory of his first
political victory. ``I've been underestimated before and Governor
Richards regrets it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told Halpin he understands how candidates sometimes get
typecast, and about the harsh way politics sometimes works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people what I believe and let the chips fall where they
may,'' Bush said. ``The only thing I know to do is lay my record
out, share my heart as best I can. I know that. That's why these
town hall meetings are important for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They key, Bush said, is for voters to experience his candidacy
directly, without the ``filter'' of the media, and decide for
themselves if they can say, ``I trust you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe you will think, the guy's got a nice mother, but
maybe he can't hack it,'' he acknowledged, to a round of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in New Hampshire for a swing through Bedford, Manchester
and Nashua, blamed the criticism he has encountered on anonymous
adversaries who ``sort of float stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when I first got going here?'' Bush asked. ``They
said, `I don't care about New Hampshire.' I said, `I'm coming. I've
got a job to do as governor, and I'm also running a national
campaign.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `He really doesn't want to come to our state that
much,' and then they said, `He's not really saying anything.' And
now they're not saying that. And now they're saying, you know, `not
smart enough,' '' Bush recounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said, I'd rather be underestimated,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The room full of predominantly older citizens rewarded Bush with
sustained applause and nodding heads. Seated on folding metal
chairs, the audience was clearly supportive throughout the
45-minutes in which Bush delivered his standard stump speech and
then answered eight questions.
</P>
<P>
   The central theme for this latest visit by Bush to the
first-in-the-nation primary state was his economic plan _ a plan he
says will spur growth and help fledgling companies, such as those
in the Granite State's burgeoning software industry. Accompanying
him on the campaign trail Wednesday were two stars of the computer
world, James Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape, and
Jesse Devitte, president of the New Hampshire Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere he went, Bush felt compelled to let his audiences
know that he has what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a big step going from governor of Texas to
president,'' he said. ``I know that. But I've had some pretty good
training.''
</P>
<P>
   While talking to the employees at White Pine Software in Nashua,
Bush also stressed his executive experience. ``Governors make
decisions, governors set agendas, governors know how to lead,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when a young woman told Bush that she is torn between him
and John McCain, the Arizona senator, he had little to say though
she asked him for differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm in the finals,'' he joked, calling McCain a good
man and saying he would not tear him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I would be a better leader than John McCain,'' he
said, once more citing his executive experience as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls make it clear that McCain is surging in New
Hampshire. A Globe/WBZ-TV poll last week found that McCain has
gained 20 points in support since late August, though Bush retained
a respectable lead. Other polls show Bush slightly or put the two
in a statistical tie though one new survey, released Wednesday by
the American Research Group, suggested that McCain may actually
have pulled ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Also a testament to McCain's surge is the fact that Bush was
holding a ``town hall meeting'' rather than one of his usual ``fire
station chats'' _ the smaller sessions with voters he has stressed
to date.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bedford event, Halpin pronounced himself content with
his decision to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are desperate to try to find a label that will
knock him off of first place,'' he said. Would he still vote for
Bush in the primary?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Halpin said. ``Not a shadow of a doubt.''

MARGARET GREENFIELD, FOUNDER OF INDEPENDENT JOURNALISM FOUNDATION,
DIES AT 74

<P>
   Margaret A. Greenfield, a founder and officer of the Independent
Journalism Foundation and a dealer in art, antiques and real
estate, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   She had cancer, said her husband, James L. Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1950s, Mrs. Greenfield was an art and antiques
dealer in London, Washington and finally Manhattan, where for about
the last 25 years she owned and ran an antiques shop, Marco Polo,
on Madison Avenue. It closed about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   She also bought, renovated and resold brownstones on the Upper
East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greenfield was active in the Independent Journalism
Foundation from its inception in 1991. The foundation, based in
Manhattan, teaches citizens of former Communist countries in
Central and Eastern Europe about working as journalists in newly
democratic societies.
</P>
<P>
   She was the foundation's treasurer and one of its founders,
along with her husband and Donald M. Wilson, a former vice
president of Time Inc. Greenfield, a former foreign correspondent
for Time magazine and former assistant secretary of state, is now a
consulting member of the editorial board at The New York Times,
where he has also been foreign editor and later an assistant
managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greenfield created and furnished the foundation's four
centers in Eastern European capitals _ in Prague, Bratislava,
Bucharest and Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Ann Schwertley Greenfield was born in Gooding, Idaho.
She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho and
worked as a stewardess for United Airlines and then for Pan
American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   She met Greenfield when she was based in Hong Kong in the early
1950s, while she was Pan Am's first stewardess based in the Far
East. They were married in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Anne
Schwertley of Manhattan and Jane Schwertley of Gainesville, Fla.

EUROPEAN UNION CONFERENCE MAY SIGNAL TURNING POINT FOR TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ European leaders will gather for a summit
meeting this weekend and confront one of the Continent's oldest and
most perplexing questions: is Turkey part of us?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, leaders of the 15-member European Union, who will
meet in Helsinki, will decide only whether to consider Turkey's
application to join. But the effect of their vote may be
far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delicate issue here is whether we are part of Europe,''
said Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. ``Europe must make a
fundamental decision. It cannot be half-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   If Turkey is made an official candidate, it will have to make
sweeping political and economic reforms to fulfill conditions for
membership. Those reforms in turn could set an example that would
resound through the Muslim world and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   An embrace from Europe would also suggest that Europeans are
overcoming age-old stereotypes about Turkey. Since the Crusades
nine centuries ago, ``the Turk'' has been a mysterious and
threatening figure in the European imagination. For that figure to
be invited to the European table as a full partner would mark a
decisive break with a long history of conflict and mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   Rejection, on the other hand, would embitter many Turks and
might convince some that their country's future lies somewhere
other than with the West.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens at the meeting, which opens Friday,
Turkey will not become a member of the European Union any time
soon. Consolidating the necessary reforms here could take a
generation or longer. About a dozen countries stand ahead of Turkey
in line for membership.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that European leaders considered Turkey's
application was in 1997. Their negative vote led to an anti-Europe
backlash in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, much has changed. Turkey has taken modest steps to
improve its human rights record. Its war against Kurdish rebels has
subsided since the capture of the rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
Perhaps most importantly, it has become friendlier with Greece, its
traditional rival.
</P>
<P>
   Greece may play a key role at the summit meeting. A vote to
consider Turkey's application must be unanimous, and every member
except Greece has at least suggested it will vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Greek leaders have refused to commit themselves. They hope to
extract promises that Turkey will help break deadlocks over the
delicate issues of Cyprus and disputed islands in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats already in Helsinki are trying to draw up a resolution
that would name Turkey as an official candidate for membership but
with language that would satisfy Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders insist they cannot accept a resolution that has
too many conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of compromising, either on the Aegean or
the Cyprus issues,'' said Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. ``Everyone
should know that Turkey has alternatives other than the EU.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turks are also increasingly aware that, as President Clinton
declared during his recent visit to Athens, ``Turkey cannot be a
member of Europe until it solves its differences with Greece.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the meeting approaches, Ecevit and other Turkish leaders are
trying to appear serene and almost uninterested. They do not want
to say anything that could upset either European leaders or Turkish
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very interesting moment,'' said Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem. ``There are external and internal political balances.''
</P>
<P>
   Many European leaders who will support Turkey's bid this weekend
remain unhappy about limitations on democracy here. Some worry
about the implications of accepting a relatively poor Muslim nation
of 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   But they have apparently reached a consensus that the best way
to encourage change in Turkey is to offer it the prospect of
membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what will happen is that Turkey will be granted
candidate status,'' said Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen. But he said Turkey does not yet fulfill ``political
conditions'' for membership, ``among other things in the field of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Turkish politicians and commentators have urged the
government to make a gesture before the summit meeting, such as
withdrawing a token number of soldiers from Cyprus or from bases
facing the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we hear is the old refrain, `We are not changing our
position,''' complained Oktay Eksi, a prominent newspaper
columnist. ``Since we are not making these gestures, or others like
them that would not harm Turkish interests, one becomes suspicious
that perhaps those who govern us do not want us to enter the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political and economic groups that fear losing power are
said to be dubious about closer ties to Europe. So are some
nationalists. But most leading politicians support the idea, as do
many ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are accepted at Helsinki, it means the ball is in our
court,'' said Adinan Cakariz, who runs a shop at Istanbul's grand
bazaar. ``We'll have to do some things about human rights, letting
Kurds speak their language, and creating an atmosphere of more
freedom in Turkey. We should do it, because Europe is our best
choice.''

ISRAEL, SYRIA TO RESUME TALKS IN WASHINGTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pressing for comprehensive Middle East peace,
President Clinton said Wednesday that Israel and Syria will resume
suspended talks next week and urged them to grasp the opportunity
to end generations of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to ``spare neither time nor effort'' in helping
the Israelis and the Syrians come to some peace agreement but
warned there ``can be no illusion here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On all tracks the road ahead will be arduous, the task of
negotiating agreements will be difficult. Success is not
inevitable,'' the president said, announcing the breakthrough
during the opening remarks of his final news conference of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Peace has long been within our sight. Today, it
is within our grasp and we must seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   The critical development on the Israeli-Syrian front comes as
the Israelis and Palestinians continue to press ahead with their
ambitious plan to develop a framework for a final agreement by
February, with a final accord by September.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hopes resumption of talks between Israel and
Syria will lead to new negotiations with Lebanon as well. Israel
already has peace treaties with Arab neighbors Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa agreed to meet next week in Washington for one or
two days and then return to the Middle East. Negotiations will
continue in the region at a site yet to be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis and Syrians still need to make courageous decisions
in order to reach a just and lasting peace. But today's step is a
significant breakthrough, for it will allow them to deal with each
other face-to-face, and that is the only way to get there,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between the two nations were suspended three years
ago after a wave of suicide bombings beset Israel. The resumption
of negotiations stalled when Syrian President Hafez Assad insisted
that Israel had previously agreed to return the Golan Heights, a
patch of Syrian land seized by Israel in the 1967 war. He demanded
the return of the occupied land before renewing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the talks would resume ``from the point where they
left off'' _ which means there are no preconditions. However,
Barak, who was elected in May, said previously he would be willing
to return the Golan Heights as part of a peace pact with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after months of work by the administration
and a personal visit to the region by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright. She met with Assad on Tuesday and Barak on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a sense that there is a historical moment to
be seized,'' Albright said during an interview with CNN. She said
the talks would include four subjects: the withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, the content of a peace agreement such as exchanging
embassies and trade relations, the security arrangements and the
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she came to the Middle East just to do an
assessment of the status of the various negotiation tracks as the
year ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found...was a sense that the moment needed to be
seized. When I arrived in Damascus, I found a President Assad who
also seemed to understand the historical moment and I think showed
some flexibility in his approach. And then I came to Jerusalem
where I met with Prime Minister Barak who also was determined to
seize the moment,'' she said. ``There's just kind of a sense that
the time is right for these talks to come together but nobody has
any illusions about how difficult they're going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright reportedly brought Barak a clarification of Syria's
position on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly is a unique opportunity,'' Barak said, speaking
in Jerusalem. ``We have so many other things to do than be deployed
for another generation or two along the borders and bury our
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian talks broke down in 1996 just as it appeared
they might be achieving some movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if the Syrian track picks up ...
quickly,'' said Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University. ``The Syrians are ready to move again and the
Syrian track, once it starts, could move very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought to move the talks along between Israel and
the Syrians and Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before us is a task as clear as it is challenging,'' Clinton
said. ``As I told Prime Minister Barak and President Assad in a
phone conversation with them earlier today, they now bear a heavy
responsibility of bringing peace to the Israeli and Syrian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he also still believed the Israelis and
Palestinians would come to a final accord. ``I'm convinced it is
possible to achieve that goal, to put an end to generations of
conflicts, to realize the aspirations of both the Israeli and the
Palestinian people, and I will do everything I can to help them in
that historic endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Barak and Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat are hashing out the most delicate issues such as the
status of Jerusalem, the formation of a Palestinian state,
refugees, prisoners and settlements. Previous accords have given
the Palestinian Authority a measure of control over portions of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's talks with Palestinians hit another hurdle this week
when the Palestinian negotiators walked out of talks, contending
that Jewish settlements on the West Bank must stop. Barak later
announced a suspension of new settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the parties to overcome those hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese will have to
confront fateful questions. They face hard choices. They will have
to stand firmly against all those who seek to derail the peace and
sadly there are still too many of them,'' Clinton said. &QL;

PEARL HARBOR TRULY A SNEAK ATTACK, PAPERS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Freshly discovered diplomatic papers published here this
week seem to overturn standard versions of the events leading up to
Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, which have been told with little
disagreement over the essential facts in history books on both
sides of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges from the papers is one of a
breathtakingly cunning deceit by Tokyo aimed at avoiding any hint
to the Roosevelt administration of Japan's hostile intentions.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, conventional wisdom has held that Japan attacked
Pearl Harbor without any official warning of a break in relations
only because of fateful accidents and plain bumbling that delayed
the delivery of a document to Washington hinting at war.
</P>
<P>
   Textbooks have dwelled on the problems of transmission and
translation of the so-called Final Memorandum, on Dec. 7, 1941 _
the day Pearl Harbor was attacked _ in which Japan notified the
United States that it was ``impossible to reach an agreement
through further negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounts have focused on the slowness of the Japanese
Embassy in Washington to produce a cable of the memorandum from
Tokyo, and on the delays caused by security rules that prohibited
having the embassy's American secretary type the document.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered documents include an earlier draft of the
Final Memorandum, dated Dec. 3, in which the Japanese Foreign
Ministry, mindful of the country's obligation under the Hague
Convention to declare war before attacking, proposed stating that
``we are forced to terminate negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, it added that Washington ``would be held
responsible for any and all the consequences that may arise in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Takeo Iguchi, the researcher who discovered the papers in the
Foreign Ministry archives, said the draft memorandum, together with
another document, the wartime diary of Japan's general staff, point
to a vigorous debate inside the government over how, indeed
whether, to notify Washington of Japan's intention to break off
negotiations and start a war.
</P>
<P>
   In its entry for Dec. 4, the diary mentions the draft version of
the Final Memorandum and makes clear that the general staffs of the
navy and army rejected the Foreign Ministry's proposed warning to
Washington. The definitive memorandum, with its much weaker
wording, was drafted the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That document was in fact intercepted before its delivery and
read by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who saw it as amounting to
a declaration of war. But aides to the president saw nothing new in
the message, and preparations against an attack were not taken.
</P>
<P>
   While the wording and timing of Tokyo's message were being
fine-tuned, Japan's diplomats in Washington, deliberately kept in
the dark by their capital, were meeting with their U.S.
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   A Dec. 7 entry in the war diary notes approvingly that ``our
deceptive diplomacy is steadily proceeding toward success.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The diary shows that the army and navy did not want to give
any proper declaration of war, or indeed prior notice even of the
termination of negotiations,'' said Iguchi, a professor of law and
international relations at the International Christian University
in Tokyo. ``And they clearly prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Iguchi said the general staff, together with a pliant Foreign
Ministry, had controlled not only the content of the message to
Washington, but also its timing, insisting that the message be
delivered to the State Department at 1 p.m. Washington time on Dec.
7.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the document was delivered to Secretary of State
Cordell Hull about 2:20 p.m., approximately one hour after the
sinking of the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Even the famous delay in delivering the message, he said, was
probably the result of deliberate planning. As evidence, he cited
the many unusual, heavy garbles in the original cable that set it
apart from most of Tokyo's clean transmissions and may have been
intended to slow its delivery to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotypical version says that Japan attacked Pearl
Harbor after intending to submit an ultimatum to Washington,''
Iguchi said, ``but because of a misunderstanding, the message was
delivered an hour too late. It has long been taught that had there
not been this delay, the attack would have been honorable. Instead,
it has been called treachery.''
</P>
<P>
   Iguchi said many of Japan's top historians had long spoken of
the supposed embassy mix-up that delayed the delivery of Tokyo's
final message to Washington as an ``ugly blemish'' on the country's
history. ``But the blemish belongs to those who engaged in
deliberate deception, or who have failed to ever go into the
documentary evidence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry confirmed that the
documents at the center of Iguchi's research were genuine but
declined to make any further comment, saying only that ``there are
many views about these events.''
</P>
<P>
   The first account of Iguchi's work was a small notice in the
daily Yomiuri Shimbun in April. This week, The Japan Times, an
English-language daily, printed a long article on the research.
Iguchi said almost none of Japan's other news publications had
shown any interest in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Iguchi's findings clash with more comfortable views of the start
of the war, and even many historians whose expertise focuses on the
same events say they were unaware of his research.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shinji Sudo, who teaches the history of international relations
at Kyoto Sangyo University, was one of those who learned of the
newly uncovered documents from a foreign journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professor Iguchi's enthusiasm has moved the debate forward,
and I value his work highly,'' he said. ``I had thought that the
blame should be placed on the negligent embassy staff, but my views
have changed considerably. Still, the are others in academic
circles who regard Professor Iguchi's work rather coldly, saying
that he is just trying to clear the dishonor of his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Iguchi, who is himself a retired diplomat, is the son of a
senior counselor in the Japanese Embassy in Washington at the time
of the attack. Until now, the embassy staff has been forced to
carry most of the blame for not informing the State Department in
time. Speculation in Japan has focused on drunkenness among key
staff members the night before, and late arrival at work.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Japan, particularly conservative historians, have clung
to the view that Washington forced war on their country. Japan's
attack on Pearl Harbor was a feat of bold and courageous military
planning and would have been completely honorable, they say, were
it not for an incompetent diplomatic staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Other historians, though, said Iguchi's work would be taken
immediately into account by specialists of this period and would
gradually work its way into textbook accounts of the start of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, in essence, a new historical drama told to us by
Professor Iguchi, and it is a contribution that will encourage
further research and teaching,'' said John Stephan, a professor of
modern Japanese history at the University of Hawaii. ``Time
magazine once described the Pearl Harbor attack as `murder hidden
by a toothy smile.' But since the early 1960s, this has been
tempered by research that focused on the communications blunders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evolution right now would seem to be back in the direction
of the kind of interpretive leanings that existed in this country
during the war. But these sorts of vicissitudes are constant in
history.''

 &HT;    Ga. group aims to cut waiting lists for social services
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Timothy Ryals couldn't function without his parents.
He needs them to bathe him, clothe him, feed him and change his
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   He is 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Ryals, of Marietta, Ga., is one of more than 12,000 Georgia
adults on waiting lists for community-based social services. Some
on the list have severe mental retardation. Others have profound
brain injuries. Most are elderly people who need assistance to stay
out of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gov. Roy Barnes promised to help.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes appointed a commission to study ways to reduce the
waiting lists, and pledged additional state money next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first for Georgia,'' Barnes said before he swore in
the commission's 15 members. The panel, he said, will ``find better
ways to include all Georgians in all facets of community life,
regardless of any type of disability or impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   But he admonished the commission members: ``Don't spend a lot of
time defining the problem. I understand what the problem is. Help
me find the solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those solutions will be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the waiting lists for 12,193 Georgians would cost
about $80.6 million a year, according to state officials and
advocacy groups. The state now spends $160.3 million to serve
17,771 people.
</P>
<P>
   At the current funding level, Georgia serves fewer people in
community-based programs per resident than any other state,
according to an advocacy group called Unlock the Waiting Lists. The
state ranks 47th in spending per citizen on services for the
developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Those adults need the greatest amount of new spending. Many are
now in institutions and are waiting to be placed in group homes or
other small facilities. Others live with family members, who often
have provided round-the-clock care for years, even decades.
</P>
<P>
   Helping those people _ such as Angela and Joe Ryals, Timothy's
parents _ would ultimately save state money, advocates for the
disabled say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you begin to provide families with a little help up front,
you prevent crisis,'' said Grace Fricks of Cleveland, Ga., a member
of the governor's commission. ``When people reach that breaking
point, that's when they need total care. That's when it gets so
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take four years to get services for all who need them,
said Annette Bowling, the commission's co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we'll eliminate the whole waiting list this
(legislative) session,'' Bowling said. ``But we'll be working very
hard to eliminate it as quickly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Barnes hopes to start paring the lists next year. In
his budget message to state legislators next month, Barnes will
suggest that they increase funding for the programs by a few
million dollars, said Renay Blumenthal, the governor's policy
director.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount of new spending Barnes will seek hasn't been
determined, Blumenthal said. But she said the money could come from
the state's tobacco settlement, or possibly from federal sources.
The new funding would be available during the fiscal year that
begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   It won't come too soon for Timothy Ryals and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Ryals has suffered from severe seizures of unknown origin since
he was a year old. He can neither talk nor control bodily
functions. Like a baby, he doesn't know not to pick up broken glass
or not to touch a hot stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timothy needs 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, 52-week-a-year
care,'' said his mother, Angela. ``He is not able to do anything
for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   A state-paid nurse helps his parents care for him 10 to 15 hours
a week. But since February 1998, they have sought additional
services: a spot in a Cobb County day care program that would teach
him such basic skills as toilet training.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I are not going to always be around,'' Angela
Ryals, a 53-year-old former teacher, said. ``He needs to be able to
do as many things as he can on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   But until the waiting lists are eliminated, she said, her son
isn't guaranteed to receive services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good start,'' she said of the governor's
announcement. ``It is a far cry from everything we need. But it's
like they say: A journey of 1,000 miles begins with the first
step.''

THE NAKED AND THE DREAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually, I try to write this column. Write it in the sense of
using words to express thoughts, the sense of employing clever
transitions and the ironic use of quotation marks. (''!'') Today,
though, we at Hey Dad Headquarters are going to give the public
what it wants: nonstop, real-life wacky anecdotes!
</P>
<P>
   Wacky Anecdote No. 1: My daughter, age 5, loves the cartoon
``Cow and Chicken'' on Cartoon Network. In fact, she likes to
pretend she's a cow, udder and all. The other day, I walked into
the TV room during ``Cow and Chicken'' time. Said daughter was
naked from the waist down, pinching herself.
</P>
<P>
   I can't handle anything having to do with my daughter and
nakedness. I am, after all, a dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaah!'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a cow!'' she said, laughing. ``I'm giving milk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother! Your daughter needs you.''
</P>
<P>
   I left the room. Mom, I hoped, was explaining the difference
between cows and people. And putting daughter's britches back on
her. Mom emerged, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK. I told her that girls give milk up here.''
</P>
<P>
   My response is not fit for Family Day!
</P>
<P>
   Wacky Anecdote No. 2: I was working on the computer while my
daughter was getting ready for bed. She was supposed to be changing
into her night-night clothes. I lost track of time, though, and
looked over at her when I heard giggling. She was again, alas,
naked, with her legs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaah!'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm watching my toots!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, I took care of the situation myself. I used this as
an opportunity to explain to her that tooting wasn't good manners.
As a bonus lesson, we went over the three types of matter: solid,
liquid and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Wacky Anecdote No. 3: My daughter came home with her second
report card. The card went into detail about how well she is doing
in class. It said that she is learning to read, that she is
learning to write, that her math aptitude is well above average. I
was exceedingly proud.
</P>
<P>
   On the back side of the card, there was some bad news, however.
The teacher marked her down in social skills. She included notes.
For example, she said that Maddison talks too much to others during
class.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother wanted to know what I thought of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said, ``a girl's gotta know what her homies are up
to, right? Who's dating who, etcetera and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher also wrote that my daughter really needs to stop
``laughing at me when I tell her she's in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is the point of the story where I reveal what a sorry
parent I am. Because _ and I apologize for this in advance _ that
just cracked me up. Because, you know, she does that to me. I tell
her she's in trouble, she starts laughing, calls me a pumkin-head,
I start laughing, she gets away with it. So she's spoiled. Sue me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' my wife said in a manner that told me she didn't mean
``Honey'' as a term of endearment, ``it may be funny to you,
because you were a brat, but we have to teach her to do what her
elders tell her.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right, of course. I called Maddison in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to me, now. When your teacher tells you that you're in
trouble, you can't laugh at her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not, Daddy?''
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the wife. ``She's got a good point, Honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've been recused from dealing with her on
school-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a borrowed anecdote. A single mother tells me about her
recent fight with nature's urge, ol' No. 1, goin' tinkle.
</P>
<P>
   While getting her two children ready for school, she heard a
yelp from the bathroom. She ran in to find her daughter frantic, as
she was ... wow, how to put this delicately? ... ``missing'' her
target ... in fact, missing high and wide, in some strange
displacement of the laws of physics, so that there was a mess
accruing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaah!'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   As she was trying to clean up her daughter's situation, her
still half-asleep son walked in and asked, ``Mom, what's on my
shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   This mother, a veteran of No. 1 wars, knew instantly what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, did you wear this when you went to the bathroom earlier
this morning?''
</P>
<P>
   It took the groggy kid a second to process this. When he did, he
responded, ``Aaah!'' Which is better than laughing about it, as my
kid would have surely done.

   Now, this is the point of the story where I reveal what a sorry
parent I am. Because _ and I apologize for this in advance _ that
just cracked me up. Because, you know, she does that to me. I tell
her she's in trouble, she starts laughing, calls me a pumkin-head,
I start laughing, she gets away with it. So she's spoiled. Sue me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey,'' my wife said in a manner that told me she didn't mean
``Honey'' as a term of endearment, ``it may be funny to you,
because you were a brat, but we have to teach her to do what her
elders tell her.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right, of course. I called Maddison in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to me, now. When your teacher tells you that you're in
trouble, you can't laugh at her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not, Daddy?''
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the wife. ``She's got a good point, Honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've been recused from dealing with her on
school-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a borrowed anecdote. A single mother tells me about her
recent fight with nature's urge, ol' No. 1, goin' tinkle.
</P>
<P>
   While getting her two children ready for school, she heard a
yelp from the bathroom. She ran in to find her daughter frantic, as
she was ... wow, how to put this delicately? ... ``missing'' her
target ... in fact, missing high and wide, in some strange
displacement of the laws of physics, so that there was a mess
accruing on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaah!'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   As she was trying to clean up her daughter's situation, her
still half-asleep son walked in and asked, ``Mom, what's on my
shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   This mother, a veteran of No. 1 wars, knew instantly what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, did you wear this when you went to the bathroom earlier
this morning?''
</P>
<P>
   It took the groggy kid a second to process this. When he did, he
responded, ``Aaah!'' Which is better than laughing about it, as my
kid would have surely done.

JUDGE VOIDS EX-IBM EMPLOYEES' SUIT ON BUYOUT TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Utica, N.Y., has dismissed a lawsuit against
the IRS by 773 former IBM employees, who contend that job buyout
payments they received in 1993 were not taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal will be appealed, said Neil Kimmelfield of the
Ball Janik law firm in Portland, Ore., as will the dismissal last
July of a similar case in the U.S. Court of Claims brought by 2,500
other former IBM workers. He said the workers in the two cases are
seeking $100 million in tax refunds plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   IBM required employees to waive all rights to sue before making
the severance payments. Alan Shapiro, the Justice Department lawyer
representing the IRS, argued in court that this waiver did not
transform the severance payments, which were based on salary and
years of service, into tax-free damages.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial testimony showed that IBM feared that workers might sue
the company over losing their jobs, Judge David Hurd wrote in a
ruling signed Friday and made available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The workers contend that most of the severance pay was in lieu
of damages for lawsuits they could have filed against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd held that even if IBM believed that 95 percent of the
severance payments were to avoid lawsuits, as an employment law
expert hired by the workers contended, the money was still taxable.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM made the payments to maintain the good will of employees
and the community,'' Hurd wrote, not to settle any potential
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that since the workers did not suffer physical
harm, a tax law that exempts such damages from taxation does not
apply.

 &HT;    CLINTON WON'T INTERVENE IN FATE OF CUBAN BOY, YIELDS TO LEGAL
REMEDIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declining to intervene, President Clinton said
Wednesday that ``what would be best for the child'' should
determine whether a six-year-old boy rescued off the coast of
Florida will be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that politics or threats should have anything to
do with if and, if I have my way, it won't,'' Clinton said. ``We
should let the people who are responsible for this, who have the
legal responsibility, try to do the right thing by the child.''
</P>
<P>
   An international dispute has arisen over the fate of Elian
Gonzalez, who survived on Nov. 25 after his mother and stepfather
drowned when their boat capsized attempting to migrate to the
United States. Elian's father, who lives in Cuba, wants his son
returned and Cuban leader Fidel Castro has echoed his demands. The
case has ignited anti-American demonstrations in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy is staying with relatives in Miami. Many
Cuban exiles believe that Elian's mother died in helping her son
escape the Communist island, and that he should be allowed to stay
as a political refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly asked about the emotional case during a lengthy and
wide-ranging press conference, Clinton indicated that he would not
get personally involved but conceded the complexities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I think all fathers would be sympathetic'' with the
Cuban man who wants his son back, Clinton said. ``The question is,
and I think the most important thing, is what would be best for the
child, and there is a legal process for determining that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I personally don't think that any of us should have any
concern other than that the law be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the concerns of the Cuban-American community in
South Florida, Clinton said that ``of course'' he would rather
``grow up in the United States.'' But there may be other concerns,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even here, sometimes it's very hard to say. Would the children
be better off with their parents in America? Almost always, but not
always,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best course is to ``try to take as much political steam out
of it as possible so that the little child can be considered,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long news conference at the U.S. State Department,
Clinton also said it would be a mistake to cut off U.S. aid to
Russia because of its military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of this aid goes to safeguard Russia's nuclear
materials or destroy warheads, he said. ``I think it is plain that
we have an interest in continuing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest is aimed at building democracy and ``I don't
think our interests would be furthered in terminating that,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring that he has ``no sympathy'' for Chechen rebels,
Clinton said Russia will ``alienate the global community'' if it
continues its attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He supports his wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in
her New York Senate race but will miss her when she moves to a New
York house and begins full-time campaigning. ``It's not the best
arrangement in the world, but it's something that we can live with
for a year. And I love the house, you know. We picked it out, and
we like it, and I'm looking forward to living there when I leave
here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He believes NASA is doing good work despite the loss of the
$165 million Mars Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep doing this if we ever hope to know what's
beyond our galaxy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He was proud of ``accomplishments'' achieved with
congressional approval including funds to hire 100,000 new teachers
and 50,000 more police officers, and sweeping banking reforms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He was ``terribly disappointed'' that Congress did not enact
other programs that he supported including a patients' bill of
rights, tougher gun laws and changes to save Social Security past
the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Al Gore is still performing ``his critical functions'' as vice
president despite the time spent seeking the Democratic nomination
for president.

 &HT;    ISRAELIS, SYRIANS AGREE TO RESTART PEACE TALKS IN WASHINGTON
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    With CLINTON-CUBA-1209.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major breakthrough in the oft-tortured Middle
East peace process, President Clinton announced Wednesday that
Israel and Syria agreed to resume peace negotiations at the point
they broke off more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round of revived talks will be held next week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process,
one that can shape the face of the region for generations to
come,'' Clinton said during an hour-long press conference at the
U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will not forgive a failure to seize this opportunity
to achieve a comprehensive peace,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton sidestepped questions on whether Israel would
return the strategic Golan Heights to Syria _ a key sticking point
in the negotiations for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad for their courage in resuming the talks,
but offered no details on any preliminary agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis and Syrians still need to make courageous decisions
in order to reach a just and lasting peace,'' the president
conceded. ``But today's step is a significant breakthrough for it
will allow them to deal with each other face to face, and that is
the only way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met Syrian and Israeli leaders in Damascus and Jerusalem.
Clinton said he had talked to both Barak and Assad by telephone
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 with one
major disagreement coming over the future of the Golan Heights.
Israel captured the region in a 1967 war, and has been reluctant to
give up the highlands because of their military significance.
</P>
<P>
   However, peace talks with several Arab countries were
rejuvenated by Barak's election this year over the hardliner former
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Clinton expressed hopes
that renewal of talks between Syria and Israel would lead to a
similar resumption of negotiations between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
after a late-night session with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
that the latter had agreed to resume faltering negotiations with
Israel on an overall Middle East settlement. That timetable calls
for a reaching a framework for a final agreement in mid-February
and a final agreement in September.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton would not say what _ if any _ concessions had been
made to get the Israeli-Syrian talks back on track. ``It would into
be useful for me to get into details,'' he said when asked about
the Golan Heights, the talks ``will be resumed from the point where
they left off.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Clinton's specification, a statement from Syria's
presidential palace said Assad welcomed the resumption.
</P>
<P>
   That vague phrasing is what got the two sides to face each
other, sidestepping the dispute over just what commitments, if any,
had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Syria claims that the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
agreed to give up this land, at the time talks broke off. Israel,
which broke off talks in 1996 after 59 people were killed in a wave
of suicide bombings against the Jewish state, has refused, saying
no such promise was ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli leaders seek a package from Syria including
access to the water sources on the Golan Heights and international
troops or monitors to prevent the strategic plateau from being used
as the source of Syrian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Syria's demand for a complete withdrawal is now a
negotiating position, rather than a pre-condition to negotiations,
said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that talks between the two nations _ in a state of
war since 1948 _ would resume in Washington next week with Barak
meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, and then
return to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official said naming al-Sharaa was a symbolic step that
would carry an important message to other Arab countries since
talks with Israel in the past have involved lower ranking
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Eyal Zisser, an Israeli expert on peace talks with Syria, said
the two sides were likely brought together by assurances he
believes they received from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those assurances, he said, likely included promises of aid money
and security. Both sides say they expect billions of dollars in
American aid for making a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said the talks with Syria should not be as difficult or
complicated as the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he cautioned, ``we have been in this movie before and
we thought everything would be OK, and we were surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Though upbeat Wednesday, Clinton was also cautious about the
chances for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no illusion here,'' Clinton said. ``On all tracks
the road ahead will be arduous, the task of negotiating agreements
will be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is not inevitable,'' he continued. ``Israelis,
Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese will have to confront fateful
questions. They face hard choices. They will have to stand firmly
against all those who seek to de-rail the peace _ and sadly there
are still too many of them.''
</P>

Jerusalem and Bob Dart reported from Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA-ISRAEL ISSUES: LAND, WATER AND SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major issues when Israel and Syria face off next
week:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LAND _ Israel captured the Golan Heights, a plateau about the
size of Rhode Island, from Syria in 1967. Syria demands that the
land all be returned.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECURITY _ Syria used to fire on Israeli villages from the
Golan. Israel will likely seek that any withdrawal be followed by
international troops or observers. Also, Israel will want to keep
some electronic listening posts on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SETTLERS _ Since Israel captured the Golan, more than 18,000
Israelis have moved there. A withdrawal would require their
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WATER _ The Golan is the source of up to a third of Israel's
water and Syria is asking that it be given land to the Sea of
Galilee and the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LEBANON _ Israel occupies a nine-mile wide swath of southern
Lebanon, a country largely controlled by Syria. Israel may require
Syria to reign in Hezbollah guerillas who threaten Israel from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY _ Both sides will want billions of dollars from the
United States. Israeli leaders claim that a withdrawal and
evacuation of residents will cost more than $10 billion. Syria,
which gets no U.S. aid currently, will seek an aid package similar
to what Egypt got for making peace with Israel _ $2 billion a year.
They will likely get much less.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RELATIONS _ Israeli leaders want to place an embassy in Syria
and allow movement between the two countries.

GM'S BUICK VENTURE IN CHINA IS A SURPRISING SUCCESS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ When General Motors chairman John Smith drove
the first Buick off an assembly line here a year ago _ after
fumbling to find the emergency brake _ it looked like an omen of
another American company's hapless foray into China.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a team of Chinese workers fussed over a white Buick
minivan _ tightening the bolts, pounding out the kinks and
otherwise putting the finishing touches on a vehicle that
represents GM's next big bet on the world's most populous nation.
This time, it rolled off the line without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   GM is off to an unexpectedly smooth start in its ambitious
campaign to conquer China's car market. The company will sell about
20,000 Buicks this year, double its own projections and those of
outside analysts. Emboldened by its success, GM plans to roll out
the new minivan next week, extending its product line from a very
expensive sedan to an equally costly family workhorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally surprised to see how many cars they sold,''
said Michael Dunne, the president of Automotive Resources Asia, a
market research firm with offices in Beijing and Bangkok. ``For the
time being, they've got a lock on a very good market.''
</P>
<P>
   A few caveats are in order. A large majority of GM's sales are
to government officials and executives at state-run enterprises.
The government has cracked down on the smuggling of imported cars,
which has eliminated much of the Buick's potential competition. And
Volkswagen's Audi unit, which also produces in China, is about to
introduce a model that could be a formidable rival to Buick.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the dire predictions of many skeptics in the
industry last December, GM executives here are allowing themselves
a low-key victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car is a lot better than people thought it would be,''
said Philip Murtaugh, the executive vice president of Shanghai GM,
which is a joint venture with China's largest sedan maker, the
Shanghai Automotive Industry Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before GM came here, the cars produced in China were
horrible,'' he said. ``The quality was poor, the service was
nonexistent, and the technology was 10 to 15 years out of date.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's early success is a beacon in the dismal landscape of
foreign joint ventures in China. The company's $750 million
investment in Shanghai GM is the largest single American investment
in the country. Its spit-and-polish assembly plant in an industrial
zone here has become a sort of shrine for Chinese and foreign
business people, who come to gawk at the cars and the camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in very early days,'' said Stephen Harner, a
former banker at Deutsche Bank here who helped arrange financing
for the venture. ``But if they can pay back their financing on time
or even ahead of schedule, it would strongly enhance the image of
the China market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Given GM's surprising sales figures, Murtaugh said he was not
fazed by the next potentially big obstacle facing the automaker:
the landmark trade agreement between China and the United States.
The deal, which will lower tariffs on imported cars to 25 percent
from their current level of 80 percent to 100 percent by 2006,
could theoretically swamp China's market with luxury cars that cost
much less than the $40,000 Buick.
</P>
<P>
   By then though, Murtaugh said, GM will have cut its own costs
enough to bring down the price of the sedan and the minivan, which
also will be priced at about $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese trade deal with the United States also offers some
potentially enticing inducements to GM and other American
automakers. For example, it would allow them to make cars more
affordable by establishing auto loan services in China, where
buying on credit remains a relative novelty. Customers pay cash up
front.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of selling a $40,000 car in a country with an annual
gross domestic product of less than $800 a person remains baffling.
China's best-selling foreign car is a utilitarian VW sedan that
sells for less than $14,000. Never mind that outside of Shanghai,
Beijing and a few other cities, China's roads are ill-suited to the
soft ride and generous curves of a Buick sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of GM's success is that the Buick was never intended
to be a mass-market vehicle in the broadest sense of the term.
General Motors is catering to government officials and managers at
state-owned companies, who get a chauffeur-driven car as a perk.
The Chinese government has encouraged these officials to buy
Buicks, and has made the choice easier by rooting out smuggled
imports. With 100 percent tariffs, legitimate imports like
Mercedes-Benz or GM's Cadillac are beyond the reach of all but the
most high-level officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the China market as a fortress with walls built all
around it, and GM is the only American manufacturer inside the
walls,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: What will General Motors do after it sells
every bureaucrat a Buick?
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hunt, the marketing and sales director of Shanghai GM, said
the company was selling more cars to private buyers than it had
expected. In particular, the Buick is proving popular in the
freewheeling province of Guangdong, which has long been home to the
smuggled Mercedes with the missing hood ornament. Still, individual
buyers account for only 10 percent of the Buick's total sales.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan is GM's first attempt to broaden the market. Hunt
said the primary buyers would continue to be government ministries
and companies. But General Motors will also woo affluent younger
executives, who could use the van on weekends to ferry their
families.
</P>
<P>
   GM will market the vehicle under the name Buick GL8. Inside the
company, employees refer to it as the W-wagon, a bit of legerdemain
that is meant to satisfy Chinese officials, who granted a license
to produce minivans to a Mercedes joint venture that is defunct.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors may have to resort to such creative nomenclature
again. Beijing is stingy about allowing foreign manufacturers to
add new models to their product lines. But employees at Shanghai GM
say the long-term goal is to produce a smaller, cheaper car that
will compete head-to-head with Volkswagen, which sold 235,000 cars
in China in 1998 and is the leading foreign automaker here.
</P>
<P>
   GM's problems could proliferate as the Chinese market becomes
more crowded. Dunne noted that next year, VW, Honda Motor and Audi
will all come out with new, locally produced models that could
erode GM's franchise. As the market matures, he predicted, the
government will grant licenses for further new models, some of
which are bound to threaten Buick.
</P>
<P>
   China's bid to join the World Trade Organization is perhaps the
biggest imponderable. Some analysts contend that even if tariffs
were slashed to 25 percent, Beijing would limit imports through
taxes and other nontariff barriers. Yet Murtaugh acknowledged that
a more open China would be a tougher place for General Motors to
compete in. ``Over the long term, WTO will probably make our lives
more difficult,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON _ Declining to intervene, President Clinton said
Wednesday that ``what would be best for the child'' should
determine whether a six-year-old boy rescued off the coast of
Florida will be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that politics or threats should have anything to
do with if and, if I have my way, it won't,'' Clinton said. ``We
should let the people who are responsible for this, who have the
legal responsibility, try to do the right thing by the child.''
</P>
<P>
   An international dispute has arisen over the fate of Elian
Gonzalez, who survived on Nov. 25 after his mother and stepfather
drowned when their boat capsized attempting to migrate to the
United States. Elian's father, who lives in Cuba, wants his son
returned and Cuban leader Fidel Castro has echoed his demands. The
case has ignited anti-American demonstrations in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy is staying with relatives in Miami. Many
Cuban exiles believe that Elian's mother died in helping her son
escape the Communist island, and that he should be allowed to stay
as a political refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly asked about the emotional case during a lengthy and
wide-ranging press conference, Clinton indicated that he would not
get personally involved but conceded the complexities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I think all fathers would be sympathetic'' with the
Cuban man who wants his son back, Clinton said. ``The question is,
and I think the most important thing, is what would be best for the
child, and there is a legal process for determining that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I personally don't think that any of us should have any
concern other than that the law be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the concerns of the Cuban-American community in
South Florida, Clinton said that ``of course'' he would rather
``grow up in the United States.'' But there may be other concerns,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even here, sometimes it's very hard to say. Would the children
be better off with their parents in America? Almost always, but not
always,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best course is to ``try to take as much political steam out
of it as possible so that the little child can be considered,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long news conference at the U.S. State Department,
Clinton also said it would be a mistake to cut off U.S. aid to
Russia because of its military campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of this aid goes to safeguard Russia's nuclear
materials or destroy warheads, he said. ``I think it is plain that
we have an interest in continuing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest is aimed at building democracy and ``I don't
think our interests would be furthered in terminating that,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring that he has ``no sympathy'' for Chechen rebels,
Clinton said Russia will ``alienate the global community'' if it
continues its attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He supports his wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, in
her New York Senate race but will miss her when she moves to a New
York house and begins full-time campaigning. ``It's not the best
arrangement in the world, but it's something that we can live with
for a year. And I love the house, you know. We picked it out, and
we like it, and I'm looking forward to living there when I leave
here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He believes NASA is doing good work despite the loss of the
$165 million Mars Polar Lander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep doing this if we ever hope to know what's
beyond our galaxy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He was proud of ``accomplishments'' achieved with
congressional approval including funds to hire 100,000 new teachers
and 50,000 more police officers, and sweeping banking reforms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He was ``terribly disappointed'' that Congress did not enact
other programs that he supported including a patients' bill of
rights, tougher gun laws and changes to save Social Security past
the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Al Gore is still performing ``his critical functions'' as vice
president despite the time spent seeking the Democratic nomination
for president.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major breakthrough in the oft-tortured Middle
East peace process, President Clinton announced Wednesday that
Israel and Syria agreed to resume peace negotiations at the point
they broke off more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round of revived talks will be held next week in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process,
one that can shape the face of the region for generations to
come,'' Clinton said during an hour-long press conference at the
U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will not forgive a failure to seize this opportunity
to achieve a comprehensive peace,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton sidestepped questions on whether Israel would
return the strategic Golan Heights to Syria _ a key sticking point
in the negotiations for the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad for their courage in resuming the talks,
but offered no details on any preliminary agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis and Syrians still need to make courageous decisions
in order to reach a just and lasting peace,'' the president
conceded. ``But today's step is a significant breakthrough for it
will allow them to deal with each other face to face, and that is
the only way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met Syrian and Israeli leaders in Damascus and Jerusalem.
Clinton said he had talked to both Barak and Assad by telephone
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 1996 with one
major disagreement coming over the future of the Golan Heights.
Israel captured the region in a 1967 war, and has been reluctant to
give up the highlands because of their military significance.
</P>
<P>
   However, peace talks with several Arab countries were
rejuvenated by Barak's election this year over the hardliner former
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Clinton expressed hopes
that renewal of talks between Syria and Israel would lead to a
similar resumption of negotiations between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
after a late-night session with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
that the latter had agreed to resume faltering negotiations with
Israel on an overall Middle East settlement. That timetable calls
for a reaching a framework for a final agreement in mid-February
and a final agreement in September.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton would not say what _ if any _ concessions had been
made to get the Israeli-Syrian talks back on track. ``It would into
be useful for me to get into details,'' he said when asked about
the Golan Heights, the talks ``will be resumed from the point where
they left off.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Clinton's specification, a statement from Syria's
presidential palace said Assad welcomed the resumption.
</P>
<P>
   That vague phrasing is what got the two sides to face each
other, sidestepping the dispute over just what commitments, if any,
had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Syria claims that the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
agreed to give up this land, at the time talks broke off. Israel,
which broke off talks in 1996 after 59 people were killed in a wave
of suicide bombings against the Jewish state, has refused, saying
no such promise was ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli leaders seek a package from Syria including
access to the water sources on the Golan Heights and international
troops or monitors to prevent the strategic plateau from being used
as the source of Syrian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Syria's demand for a complete withdrawal is now a
negotiating position, rather than a pre-condition to negotiations,
said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that talks between the two nations _ in a state of
war since 1948 _ would resume in Washington next week with Barak
meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, and then
return to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official said naming al-Sharaa was a symbolic step that
would carry an important message to other Arab countries since
talks with Israel in the past have involved lower ranking
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Eyal Zisser, an Israeli expert on peace talks with Syria, said
the two sides were likely brought together by assurances he
believes they received from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those assurances, he said, likely included promises of aid money
and security. Both sides say they expect billions of dollars in
American aid for making a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said the talks with Syria should not be as difficult or
complicated as the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he cautioned, ``we have been in this movie before and
we thought everything would be OK, and we were surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Though upbeat Wednesday, Clinton was also cautious about the
chances for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no illusion here,'' Clinton said. ``On all tracks
the road ahead will be arduous, the task of negotiating agreements
will be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is not inevitable,'' he continued. ``Israelis,
Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese will have to confront fateful
questions. They face hard choices. They will have to stand firmly
against all those who seek to de-rail the peace _ and sadly there
are still too many of them.''
</P>
<P>

Jerusalem and Bob Dart reported from Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA-ISRAEL ISSUES: LAND, WATER AND SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Here are the major issues when Israel and Syria face off next
week:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LAND _ Israel captured the Golan Heights, a plateau about the
size of Rhode Island, from Syria in 1967. Syria demands that the
land all be returned.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECURITY _ Syria used to fire on Israeli villages from the
Golan. Israel will likely seek that any withdrawal be followed by
international troops or observers. Also, Israel will want to keep
some electronic listening posts on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SETTLERS _ Since Israel captured the Golan, more than 18,000
Israelis have moved there. A withdrawal would require their
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  WATER _ The Golan is the source of up to a third of Israel's
water and Syria is asking that it be given land to the Sea of
Galilee and the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  LEBANON _ Israel occupies a nine-mile wide swath of southern
Lebanon, a country largely controlled by Syria. Israel may require
Syria to reign in Hezbollah guerillas who threaten Israel from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  MONEY _ Both sides will want billions of dollars from the
United States. Israeli leaders claim that a withdrawal and
evacuation of residents will cost more than $10 billion. Syria,
which gets no U.S. aid currently, will seek an aid package similar
to what Egypt got for making peace with Israel _ $2 billion a year.
They will likely get much less.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  RELATIONS _ Israeli leaders want to place an embassy in Syria
and allow movement between the two countries.

<P>
   IN THE NEVADA DESERT _ Michael Heizer doesn't want you to know
where he lives, just that he's in the middle of nowhere in the
middle of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   His ranch is an isolated copse of trees and low buildings in an
immense, flat, otherwise bone-dry valley _ a desert ringed by
mountains, 40 miles, more or less, from the nearest neighbor, up to
two hours' drive to the closest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the house is what looks from a distance like a low,
U-shaped enclosure, an odd though not particularly dramatic bump in
the land. Scale is deceptive in the desert. Up close, the bump
turns into Heizer's sculpture ``City,'' or, to be precise, the
first phase of it, which he has just finished. The sculpture
consists of three rectangular structures around a curved, sunken
gravel-coated court or pit.
</P>
<P>
   The structures _ which he calls ``complexes,'' a term
archaeologists use for buildings at ancient sites _ are immense
concrete and dirt mastabas, rectangles with sloped sides. ``Complex
2'' is by itself more than a quarter-mile long. Its irregular
surface incorporates two projections, one triangular and one
rectangular, and several upright slabs that poke up over the top
like mountain peaks. The slabs ( Heizer calls them steles) rise as
much as 70 feet and weigh up to a thousand tons each.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, what exists of ``City'' has got to be one of the
most massive modern sculptures ever built. After nearly 30 years,
Heizer has passed the first stage toward completing what is
essentially his own Chichen Itza in the desert. There are four more
stages to go.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1960s and early '70s, art began to move outdoors
from galleries, and Heizer, among American artists, helped lead the
way. He started as a painter, making shaped canvases with spaces
carved out of the middle of them. In 1967, he completed ``North,
East, South, West 1,'' which included several holes he dug in the
Sierra Nevada, the holes akin to the shapes in his paintings. He
did similar works in the Mojave desert, and in 1968 he did ``Nine
Nevada Depressions'': big, curved and zigzagging trenches, like
abstract doodles on the earth, placed intermittently over a span of
520 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Another early sculpture, ``Cilia,'' turned dug forms into light
wells to catch the sun at different angles. His ``Dye Paintings''
involved big bags of white lime powder and concentrated aniline
dyes scattered across the desert floor, and he also drove a
motorcycle across a dry lake bed, the tire tracks becoming like
drawn lines.
</P>
<P>
   Partly the move outdoors by Heizer and others reflected '60s art
politics, the new eco-spirit and a general reaction against the art
object as commodity. Works in the land were things that you
couldn't put on your mantle, that didn't even necessarily last.
Some of them, like ``Nine Nevada Depressions,'' involved removing
dirt to create sculptures out of the spaces left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Un-sculpture'' is the term Heizer likes, along with
``sculpture in reverse.'' Negation, duration and decay became part
of a new sculptural vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The move outdoors also involved a rejection of prevailing
modernist ideology, and in particular of the critic Clement
Greenberg's notion that the best art had to concentrate on its own
formal properties. Artists working outdoors wanted to reconnect the
art world and the real world. Their materials were no longer canvas
and paint or marble but dirt, sand and steel _ even sun and air.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not just Americans were involved in this quiet
revolution. Joseph Beuys was in Germany; Ricng was in
England; and the Arte Povera group was in Italy. That said, Long
was leaving discreet marks on the countryside. Heizer was blowing
up things with explosives, so the connections were real but
limited. And there was something particularly American about the
size and ambition of some of the outdoor works.
</P>
<P>
   The Abstract Expressionists had made large scale a
characteristic of American art. Beginning in the late 1940s,
writings about Pollock and others often referred to the expanses of
the West. By the 1960s artists like Heizer, with Pollock clearly in
mind, were making art in the landscape of a size to rival it. A
520-mile sculpture is a very big thing.
</P>
<P>
   Heizer came up with the idea for ``City'' in 1970, when he was
in the Yucatan studying the serpent motif in the ball court at
Chichen Itza. He was 24. The previous year he finished ``Double
Negative,'' a spectacular 1,500-foot-long, 50-foot-deep,
30-foot-wide gash cut onto facing slopes of an obscure mesa in
Nevada, a project that required blasting 240,000 tons of rock. It
was quickly recognized as the archetype of what people were
beginning to call Land Art or Earth Art or Environmental Art. It
made a huge impact.
</P>
<P>
   His next plan, for ``City,'' was to build a suite of giant,
variously shaped abstract sculptures over an area that covered more
than a mile end to end _ modern art turned into monumental abstract
architecture, with ancient ruins as the model.
</P>
<P>
   Heizer's goal with ``City'' was to link contemporary American
art and Pollock's legacy with the grandeur of the Olmecs, Mayans,
Incas and Aztecs. ``I was just doing what had already been done for
centuries, but not in a while,'' he says. ``City'' was a very
American kind of dream: big, brash, maverick, optimistic and a
little loopy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heizer lives beside ``City'' in a comfortable ranch house with
wood-burning stoves, a Remington sculpture, a big satellite
television and a beamed ceiling. ``Shrubs of the Great Basin'' and
``Weeds of the West'' are on a bookshelf in the kitchen. An
outbuilding for solar panels and a generator is across from a metal
shop where he spends most of his time. And there are also studios
for him and his assistants, Mary Shanahan and Jennifer Mackiewicz,
artists who've been with him for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Indefatigable, patient pioneers, they somehow manage to do their
own work while bringing order to Heizer's life. When necessary,
they'll change a tire or haul heavy equipment. He is devoted to
them.
</P>
<P>
   There are dogs, cats, horses, sheep and cattle, and machinery
everywhere: road graders, loaders, tractors, horse trailers, manure
spreaders, concrete mixers. The place is an industrial construction
site, working farm and survivalists' hideaway.

`THE THIRD MAN' `THE LAST PICTURE SHOW' COME TO DVD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: For use Friday, Dec. 10 or later) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Bogdanovich calls it a happy accident, like
``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   He is referring to ``The Third Man,'' the Carol Reed-directed
film starring Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard and Alida
Valli.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War thriller set in Vienna has recently been remastered
for its 50th anniversary, and has been released on DVD by
Criterion, $39.95 (VHS, $25.95).
</P>
<P>
   Bogdanovich wasn't being derogatory in his description of the
film. There were a number of major talents involved. The script was
written by Graham Greene, based on his novel. Cotten and Howard
were no slouches as actors, and Welles' prodigious talents were
legendary. Cinematographer Robert Krasker was considered a genius
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, though, was more a workmanlike director. Actually, at that
time he looked like a filmmaker who was coming into his own. He had
made a couple of highly regarded films (``Odd Man Out,'' ``Fallen
Idol'') previously, and whether he was at the top of his game when
making ``The Third Man'' or just smart enough to use the talents
around him doesn't really matter in the end. Filmgoers were given a
classic.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Krasker's Oscar-winning photography of the sinister
Vienna streets owes something to Welles' ``Citizen Kane,'' as
Bogdanovich points out. Welles, for his part, had a a great
``talked-about role'' as Harry Lime. In the story, Holly Martins
(Cotten) is an alcoholic pulp writer who has been summoned to
occupied Vienna by his old friend Lime. But he arrives to find
Lime's funeral under way. From Lime's girlfriend (Valli) and a
British officer (Howard), Martins learns of allegations of Lime's
involvement in racketeering. Not believing the charges, Martins
vows to clear his friend's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Welles loved the role is that he didn't show up till
later in the picture but everybody talked about him before then _
so he became the most memorable character.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Welles and Bogdanovich, a special collector's
edition of ``The Last Picture Show'' has been released on DVD
(Columbia, $27.95). The DVD includes an additional eight minutes
added back into the film and the 65-minute ``Look Back'' feature in
which Bogdanovich explains that it was Welles who suggested to him
that he shoot the picture in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   A student of film, Bogdanovich wasn't shy about taking from the
masters like Welles and John Ford, but what he fashioned in ``The
Last Picture Show'' was purely his own, and in its own right a
classic.
</P>
<P>
   The casting alone was extraordinary _ Jeff Bridges, Cybill
Shepard, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, longtime Ford regular Sam
Johnson, Eileen Brennan, Timothy Bottoms and Randy Quaid, with
Leachman and Johnson winning Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Larry McMurtry, ``The Last Picture Show''
tells the story of a small Texas town _ from football season to
football season _ in 1951. The title refers to the fact that the
main-street movie house is about to close for good. The spare
black-and-white cinematography (by the wonderful Robert Surtees)
evokes the loneliness and hopelessness that pervades the town. A
eulogy for the passing of an era, the film is brilliantly acted by
the entire cast, thanks to Bogdanovich.
</P>
<P>
   The feature also has remembrances from Bridges, Shepard,
Brennan, Burstyn and producer-director Frank Marshall (``Back to
the Future,'' the ``Indiana Jones'' trilogy), who was an assistant
to Bogdanovich and an actor in the film. But Bogdanovich is the
most interesting. Partly because although he had other successes,
his career never lived up to its promise, perhaps because the
classic style of filmmaking in which he was interested got lost in
the MTV slam-bam style popular today. (He did have ``Paper Moon''
and ``What's up Doc?'' but the rest of his career so far has been
hit-or-miss.)
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, he tells a story about a conversation he had
with Welles in which he lamented that Greta Garbo, an actress he
admired, had only appeared in two great movies. Welles' reply was
that it only takes one. It's a poignant comment. After all, Welles
always had ``Kane'' despite his other troubles, and Bogdanovich ...
well, there's ``The Last Picture Show.'' &QL;

 IN THE NEVADA DESERT: survivalists` hideaway.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1970, Heizer hired G. Robert Deiro, a pilot from Las Vegas,
to help him find the property. It had sand and gravel, running
water from a creek, isolation, the right climate _ and it was
cheap. Almost 90 percent of Nevada is public land. This was private
property surrounded by public land.
</P>
<P>
   Heizer gradually acquired three square miles, at $30 an acre.
The last parcel was paid off two years ago. ``Even I could save
$150 a month,'' Heizer says. ``Bob helped me get it, parcel by
parcel. He went into county records and researched the owners. They
all wanted to sell. Why not? Barren land in the middle of nowhere?
It was the best thing that ever happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Heizer lived in a trailer with his wife, Barbara (they
were divorced a couple of years ago). There was a weed-covered
livestock trail to the property, and Heizer wore out a new truck a
year getting to and from the place. Half the winter he'd be locked
in. Once he went for 10 months and saw only a couple of sheep
trailers and the occasional pickup truck in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   He began work on ``Complex 1'' in 1971. A farmer lent him a
paddle-wheel scraper to move dirt. Seismic engineers drew up plans
for the 30-ton, T-shaped and L-shaped concrete columns that
protrude from the complex. When the sculpture is viewed straight on
from a distance, these shapes align visually to make a frame around
the structure: an optical illusion causes the complex's slope to
seem to flatten into a monochrome rectangle, three stories high,
like one of Heizer's early paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Heizer was able to finish most of ``Complex 1'' by himself. He
began ``Complex 2'' in 1980 and ``Complex 3'' after that. But it
was becoming increasingly difficult to go on as his cash dwindled.
``A lot of money over the years went into simply trying to maintain
old, useless equipment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He painted and made other sculptures during the '80s, including
one called ``Levitated Mass'' that was installed outside the IBM
building in Manhattan. ``I never stopped working on the pit and the
complexes, whenever I could afford to,'' he says. ``But we're
talking crazy optimism here.''
</P>
<P>
   Heizer had met the artists Walter De Maria in 1966 and Robert
Smithson in 1969 in New York, and they became linked with him as
Land artists. He brought them west. Smithson finished ``Spiral
Jetty'' in Utah in 1970. De Maria made ``Lightning Field'' in New
Mexico a few years later. Those works became famous. While Heizer
was immersed in his ``City,'' Smithson wrote articles that made him
the unofficial spokesman for the movement.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Heizer felt usurped and cheated. He began to
seethe about the New York art scene, which he regarded as fickle
and amnesiac. His frustration grew as the years went by. His
freestanding sculptures included big stones carved into shapes that
recalled tools.
</P>
<P>
   They were sometimes perforated like Swiss cheese or wedged into
metal frames. Because of their size, he could never really show his
work properly in New York, he felt, so he couldn't ``play the
game.'' His first gallery show of any real size in the city _ and
therefore of any value to him, he says _ happened only five years
ago, at Ace Gallery, when he was already 50.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Robert Smithson or a few others associated with
Earthworks to Heizer and he's off. ``High-speed hustlers'' is one
of the few printable terms. ``What was some guy from New Jersey
doing building a sculpture like mine on a lake in Utah?'' he asks
about Smithson and ``Spiral Jetty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I figure, how much more original can you get than having
nine different people doing what I did first, and none of them
giving me credit? Actually, it's the academics who did not do a
good historical job who are really to blame. I wasn't political
enough to write articles about myself or go to cocktail parties,
meaning that not only has my art been pirated and my intellectual
property rights stolen, but my work has been misrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Heizer was feeling exhausted and thinking about
demolishing what existed of Complexes 2 and 3, leaving just Complex
1. Then Michael Govan, the director of the Dia Foundation, stepped
in and, with money from both Dia and the Lannan Foundation (nobody
would say how much), he arranged to pay to complete the three
complexes and pit.
</P>
<P>
   There was an irony about this that wasn't lost on Heizer. Dia
had offered to underwrite the whole project when Heizer started it
30 years ago, but he had declined. Heiner Friedrich, who founded
Dia, had been Heizer's first dealer, and the two had fallen out.
</P>
<P>
   With money, Heizer was able to hire outside help. Decades of
pent-up desire combined with the inexperience of the construction
crew to make the situation sometimes rocky at first. Heizer can be
warm and solicitous, but also touchy, anxious and strong willed.
</P>
<P>
   The men had never worked on a project like this, which involved
unusual materials, gigantic forms in odd shapes and tricky
conditions. Storms would sweep across the valley and, in minutes,
wipe out $30,000 of labor on one of the steles. This happened four
or five times. The surfaces of the complexes required constant
readjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Heizer would become upset when the shape of one of the forms he
had drawn was not reproduced as he wanted. He wanted everything to
be just right. At one point, he asked that hundreds of thousands of
yards of dirt be moved 27 inches to align Complexes 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a dogmatic, purist psychopath,'' he insists. ``There's
an unfair image of me _ mean, crazy, hostile. I'm really a very
gentle person.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Heizer got sick. He felt pain in his fingers and
toes, which he mistook for frostbite because he had been standing
in the cold 12 hours a day working on his sculpture. But when the
pain moved to his shoulders and back, a Medivac helicopter had to
fly into the valley and rush him to a doctor, who sent him home and
told him he was drinking and smoking too much.

SECOND BODY FOUND IN `BUILDING FROM HELL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL AND STEPHANE EBBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Just after midnight Wednesday, firefighters
picking through the wreckage of a burned-out warehouse retrieved
the body of a second firefighter who died Friday in the ``building
from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lyons, 34, was found in a corner of the second floor of
the Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. and taken to the
Boston Medical Examiner's office, where his remains were
identified.
</P>
<P>
   But the painstaking search for the remains of his four
colleagues, carried out by 40 firefighters, continued for most of
the day in a process one described as both tedious and horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish to hell it was over,'' said an exhausted,
soot-covered firefighter, Norman Beck, who emerged at 5:30 p.m.,
after a full day of sifting through ash. ``And then you come out of
there and you see these people and you see these flowers and you
see these cops and they're all heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton and thousands of firefighters from
around the world are expected to attend a tribute to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But District Chief Walter Giard said many Worcester firefighters
would remain at the warehouse, continuing the difficult search for
their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many Worcester firefighters that would rather be
working here than attending the memorial service,'' Giard said.
``To them, this is much more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who died in a search for two homeless people purported
to be inside the fiery warehouse included: Paul Brotherton, 41;
Jeremiah Lucey, 38; Lt. Thomas Spencer, 42; Joseph McGuirk, 38; and
Timothy Jackson, 51, whose body was removed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Worcester authorities arrested Julie S. Barnes, 19,
and Thomas S. Levesque, 37, a homeless couple who had lived in the
warehouse as squatters. They were charged Tuesday with six counts
of involuntary manslaughter for allegedly sparking the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they knocked over a candle during an
argument, setting papers ablaze. Unable to extinguish the fire,
they left the warehouse without reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Known to local homeless advocates, the pair had faced criminal
charges in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was charged with shoplifting cosmetics from a CVS in
Worcester Sept. 13. Levesque, meanwhile, was charged with assault
and battery in October 1989 and with domestic assault and battery
in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who had reportedly dropped out of school, most recently
attended Wachusett Regional for about two weeks beginning March 30,
according to Principal Tom Pandiscio. She had also attended
Worcester's South High and North High.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters were trying to give the homeless ``another day
to live. And they lost their lives doing it,'' said Lt. Greg
Zinkus.
</P>
<P>
   Tears welled to his eyes as he noticed for the first time a
billboard memorializing the six firefighters, whose images stared
down at him near the scene of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of sympathy, which started as news of the tragedy
spread, continued Wednesday. Flowers, wreaths and sympathy cards
continued to mount on a Worcester fire truck that has become a
makeshift shrine to the fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this has taught me is that people in this city, in this
state, in this country care when it matters the most,'' said
Worcester Fire Department EMS Coordinator Tom Creamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone we don't know stands in front of the fire truck
and starts crying over someone they don't even know, they have lost
someone,'' he added. ``They may not know them, but they know they
lost something.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after the raging fire, flames were still visible
inside the wreckage, and the emotions among firefighters were just
as raw. Some firefighters, frustrated by the slow pace but
determined to find their fallen comrades, are still working,
despite just 16 hours of sleep over five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not one of us, you don't even know what it's like,''
said Alfred K. Whitehead, general president of the International
Association of Firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said the families of the six victims will be presented
with the IAFF's medal of honor, the highest award bestowed by the
agency, during Thursday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers continued to use cadaver-sniffing dogs and metal
detectors in the hopes of picking up even the slightest clue of
firefighters' remains, from fragments of air tanks to belt buckles.
</P>
<P>
   Even after darkness fell, crews used a huge spotlight to
illuminate the building for their grim task: Sorting brick-by-brick
through the rubble, as forensic experts sift the ashes for even the
smallest clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for pieces. You're looking for anything. You're
using your hands. You're screening the piles,'' said Beck. ``You're
looking for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, firefighters had only covered one-third of the building,
Giard said.
</P>
<P>
   District Chief Randy A. Chavoor said they found several hot
spots which forensic experts examined, using a quarter-inch screen
to sift through debris. They found only buckles and pieces of
straps for air tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe today we've made more progress than in previous
days,'' Giard said. ``But the building still has not surrendered
our people.''

 IN THE NEVADA DESERT: too much.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The doctor prescribed Tylenol. The pain became unbearable.
Heizer went to New York to see a neurologist and collapsed on his
way into the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly died. He had contracted polyneuropathy, a nerve
disease, which caused him to lose much of the use of his
extremities. His weight plummeted. After therapy, he was able to
walk, but he had become pretty much paralyzed on his left side.
</P>
<P>
   He had always been an artist who could operate his own big
machinery and build what he wanted himself. Then he found himself
in a walker for a year. He still needs a crutch. ``At least I'm
working again,'' he said. ``I had set out to do this sculpture by
myself as a young man. When I got sick I figured that was the end
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month he turned 55. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You shouldn't try calling on Heizer uninvited. We were talking
on the telephone a while back. ``A guy called from France,'' he
told me. ``He was complaining: `It's not done yet? How long is it
going to take.' And I said I was sorry that I hadn't got it done
for him. My God, you don't go into a painter's studio unless he
wants you there. I got called by a travel agent who asked where the
bus stop was. The project has involved a time reference the art
world clearly can't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived low for 30 years and privacy is now all I ask,'' he
said. ``All these rubberneckers show up as if it's entertainment.
People fly over the place. This is private property. People presume
that I want them to see it. That is a rash presumption. Only
one-fifth of the whole job is done. Liability is an issue. The site
is dangerous. The work isn't cohesive yet. When I finish Phase 5,
OK''
</P>
<P>
   He suddenly disappeared. Gunshots in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was shooting to scare a coyote away from the sheep,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget my privacy,'' he continued as if nothing had happened.
``It's also about how the work should be seen. I've made it big to
make you feel small standing in it. Flying over it squishes the
Gestalt. It's supposed to be about a motor-delayed, cumulative
observation: you've got to walk around it, climb over it and later
put it together in your mind and figure out where you were. It
isn't the old convenient art object.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think size is the most unused quotient in the sculptor's
repertoire because it requires lots of commitment and time. To me
it's the best tool. With size you get space and atmosphere:
atmosphere becomes volume. You stand in the shape, in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   I woke up at dawn one day to see ``City.'' It looked like a
vast, empty stadium, sleek and expectant. Its surface is a
graduated aggregate of reinforced volcanic cinder block, colored to
look like humble dirt. The steles in this light seem like cutouts,
stuck on. The landscape being mostly obscured to someone standing
in the pit, the mountain ridge in the distance appears only in the
spaces between the complexes. The surrounding landscape isn't the
point, Heizer insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason I put my ranch right next door to the
sculpture,'' he says. ``I wanted to prove that I am here for the
materials, not for the view. I'd have built this thing in New
Jersey if it had been possible. All these so-called experts try to
say my work is about the West, that's it about the view. They don't
know what they're talking about. I came for the space and because
it was cheap land. I don't care if you see the mountains. The
sculpture is partly open because, rather than put you in a box, I
want you to be able to breathe. But I also want to isolate you in
it, to contain you in it, like in all my negative sculptures. It's
not really different from `Double Negative.' The sculpture is the
issue, not the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of the experience of being in the ``City'' inevitably
involves the isolation of the valley, the light and the weather,
which are aspects of the environment. From 80 degrees the previous
afternoon, the temperature plummeted to 15 overnight, causing an
efflorescence, like frost, to coat parts of the complexes, whose
masses were shimmering gray silhouettes in the half-light.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun rose, daylight fell gradually over different parts
of the complexes. They were so big that the sun didn't seem to
strike them equally all at once, which was part of Heizer's intent.
Time is an element, as it is in other projects in the land, like
``Lightning Field'' and James Turrell's ``Roden Crater,'' in
Arizona, another long-delayed sculpture lately revived with help
from the Lannan Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The first men from the construction crew arrived by 7:15. They
drive 90 miles through the mountains _ it's a dirt road, the old
Denver-San Francisco stagecoach route _ then reverse the trip at
night. This morning they were completing concrete runoffs for water
on Complexes 2 and 3. They steered one of the cement mixers through
the pit past Complex 3. The contrast of size between the mixer and
the sculpture made the truck look like a marble in a shoe box.
</P>
<P>
   Heizers have lived in Nevada since the 1880s. One grandfather,
Ott F. Heizer, was a mining engineer, the other, Olaf P. Jenkins,
was the chief geologist for California. State maps in California
are still named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Heizer, Heizer's father, was an archaeologist from
Lovelock, Nev., who taught at the University of California,
Berkeley. He specialized in the Great Basin, in California and in
the Yucatan. He also worked in Egypt, Bolivia and Peru. He was
writing a book about the ancient transport of massive stones when
he died.
</P>
<P>
   You can't understand Michael Heizer without remembering what his
father and grandfather did. At the root of his art are archaeology,
geology and anthropology. About the idea behind the steles on
Complex 2, he says, ``One source is a verbal description in a book
by my dad about La Venta in the Yucatan.''
</P>
<P>
   La Venta was an Olmec ceremonial complex. The book has drawings
of excavated stones shaped like Heizer's sculptures, with complexes
of structures like the ``City.'' He says that the forms are not
directly lifted from the book, but had generally been on his mind
as abstract shapes. His sculptures also allude to American-Indian
tumuli, or burial mounds, and to the mastaba that was originally on
top of Zoser's tomb at Saqqara in Egypt, where he went with his
father.

 IN THE NEVADA DESERT: his father.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He volunteered a childhood story: when he was 6, he says,
without permission he made a city out of wire, cans, glass and
rocks on a hill beside his school, which the school janitor
destroyed but the principal allowed him to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a year in high school, in France, then quit. His father
took him to Mexico when he was 12 and to Peru and Bolivia when he
was 18. He made drawings of the sites. He learned about, but never
saw, the famous ancient Peruvian Nazca Lines, which he says had
nothing to do with his ``Dye'' paintings or ``Depressions,''
although he acknowledges that he was influenced by similar gravel
lines, made by other ancient peoples, along the Colorado River in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really I was interested in taking Pollock a step further,'' he
said. ``I wasn't an academic looking in books for ideas. But I
educated myself about historical work that was similar to mine, to
provide a frame of reference that wasn't the usual frame of
reference of the New York art world and Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly he took classes at the San Francisco Art Institute. In
1966, at 21, he moved to Manhattan and found a loft on Mercer
Street in what was coming to be known as SoHo. Carl Andre, Dan
Flavin, Walter De Maria, Tony Smith and Frank Stella were artists
of the moment, and they became his friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke a language of reduction, geometry and elementary
forms. John Chamberlain was making sculptures out of crushed cars.
Heizer particularly admired their ``toughness,'' he says. He's
averse to the idea of influence: ``My formative years were over by
the time I arrived in New York. I was already making statements. I
wasn't looking around for influences.'' He uses the word affinity.
``I'd say, if anybody's work had an affinity with mine, it's Tony's
and Carl's and Walter's.''
</P>
<P>
   Heizer would like to redo people's perceptions of the past in
more ways than one. About his early sculptures in the desert, he
says he recognized at the time and was willing to absorb the factature would gradually overtake them, in the way that ancient
sites were altered over time, but these days he makes a point of
saying that he was never altogether happy with the deterioration:
``Climate affected my early works and I accepted and studied it,
but I'm resistant to it now.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to redo the deteriorating trenches of ``Double
Negative'' in an obdurate concrete mixture, returning it to its
pristine condition forever. ``It will have had too short a career
if it disappears.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A model of his plans for the rest of ``City'' are in his studio:
a long clay model of abstract blocks, myriad shapes, like obscure
board-game pieces, in an eccentric arrangement. The project's
remaining four phases, he says, are each as big as the first.
</P>
<P>
   Heizer wants to start on the fifth phase next, meaning with the
sculptures at the opposite end from Complexes 1, 2 and 3, a mile
away, to define the perimeter of the entire project. If nothing
else, that would create an enclosure. But he seems to believe that
he can actually finish the whole project in the next five years, if
the flow of money remains steady.
</P>
<P>
   Does he feel isolated in the desert, working on his sculpture
decade after decade? ``Nevada is the only place for me that's
home,'' he says, then adds: ``I'm a committed professional, and I
would go anywhere to pursue this line of work. I'm not living here
because of lifestyle. I'm here because New York is expensive and
limiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always planned to get old someday and crawl back into my
studio and paint. That's still the idea. But I'm making sculpture
now, and for a sculptor like me it's impossible to build big works
in New York. It's too expensive. I need cranes. I operate in the
20-ton minimum range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work with scale,'' he adds. ``I work with size. Scale
is an effete art term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I screw up out here,'' he says, ``I know it will be big
time. I'm going to go down in flames.''

DEMOCRATS OFFER CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS ROOMS AT SWANK HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and LANCE WILLIAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The California Democratic Party is offering
legislative staffers up to four free nights at the San Francisco
Hilton if they agree to spend their days walking precincts for
Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The state party is offering the free rooms to induce Democrats
to help Brown fend off Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano
in the Dec. 14 mayoral run-off election.
</P>
<P>
   The party contributed $80,000 to Brown's re-election campaign in
the November election, said Bob Mulholland, a longtime Democratic
strategist, and may drop another $100,000 in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a former state Assembly speaker, was elected mayor in
1995 and faced a tough re-election last month. He failed to win an
absolute majority, forcing him into a run-off race with Ammiano, a
write-in candidate who finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has a lot of friends in Sacramento,'' Mulholland
said Tuesday. ``People remember that when we were out in the
desert, under (Republican governors) Wilson and Deukmejian, he was
our shining star.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffers for state Senate Democrats said volunteers were being
offered up to four nights at the Hilton, starting Friday.
Mulholland said he was not sure if it would be the Hilton, but
said, ``They won't be at a nonunion hotel. This is very important
to the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the effort was independent of Brown's campaign. Such
so-called soft-money campaigns are exempt from the city's tough
political contribution limits, and independent Brown boosters are
expected to spend more than $1 million in the run-off.
</P>
<P>
   In November, anywhere from 40 to 120 legislative employees
traveled to San Francisco to work for Brown on Election Day. Some
rode on a bus supplied by the campaign and spent the day in the
city making phone calls, hanging campaign literature from doors,
encouraging Brown supporters to vote and then making sure they did.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the volunteers were employees of state Senate President
pro tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, one of Brown's closest
friends. Others came from the office of Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, and Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, D-San
Francisco, who also are close to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict there will probably be the same amount of people who
want to work for Willie in the run-off,'' said Dave Sebeck, a
spokesman for Burton. ``We'll be arguing over who gets to walk
Union Square, so we can get our Christmas shopping done, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano campaign spokesman Hunter Cutting said the effort is a
sign that the Brown campaign is nervous about the outcome of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's important ... is it seems the Brown campaign is
not too confident in what it's doing to win,'' Cutting said. ``It's
interesting that they have to call in all their chits from all over
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not illegal for legislative staff members to do political
work, but they are not allowed to do it on the state's dime.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long tradition of staff members, both Republicans and
Democrats, traveling hundreds of miles to work tight elections in
places like Fresno or Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   They are not paid, but they usually get a meal, transportation
and a party afterward. But in the past, those efforts almost always
involved a battle for a key legislative or congressional seat.

 &HT;    Excite At Home strategy creates a 'major player'
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Excite At Home, the largest provider of high-speed
Internet access, plans to significantly widen its lead next year
through overseas expansion and retail sale of its service.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which uses digital cable TV systems to connect to
the Internet, is well on track to meet its ambitious goal. It's
adding tens of thousands of new subscribers a month and doubling
its market penetration every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great growth story and we intend to be a major
player in the Internet business in 2000,'' said Kenneth Goldman,
Excite At Home's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's comments were part of a briefing he gave Wednesday on
the future of his company at the annual PaineWebber media
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, being held in Midtown Manhattan through
Thursday, is attended by about 1,000 media executives, investors
and Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The Silicon Valley, Calif.-based company's session was one of
the more well-attended.
</P>
<P>
   Excite At Home, a pioneer in high-speed Internet access, uses
the digital cable networks of 23 different cable operators to
connect users to the Internet at speeds up to 100 times faster than
traditional telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Among Excite At Home's partners are Atlanta-based Cox
Communications Inc. and Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp., each of
which own about 12 percent of the Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Excite At Home has 1 million subscribers nationwide,
including some in metro Atlanta through Comcast systems. That's
more than double the number of the second largest provider of
high-speed access, Road Runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Road Runner Service is offered in metro Atlanta by MediaOne,
the area's largest single cable TV provider. MediaOne is in the
process of being acquired by AT&AMP;T, which has an exclusive deal with
Excite At Home through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Excite At Home hopes to boost sales even further through selling
its service in retail stores and with computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, both Dell and Compaq now offer sale of the service
with its computers. Consumers must purchase a cable modem
separately.
</P>
<P>
   SELF-INSTALLATION
</P>
<P>
   Initially, users have to lease a modem from their cable
operator, which also installs the service. The time it takes to
install the service now averages about one hour and thirty minutes,
said Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Cable Internet access is considered a premium service and costs
more than regular cable TV service.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, though, said his company is working hard toward the day
when consumers can buy a computer already equipped with both a
cable modem and their service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is on self-installation, making it easy and seamless
for users,'' said Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of growth is overseas. Already, Excite At Home
offers its service in Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, Belgium,
Holland and Luxemburg.
</P>
<P>
   In total, said Goldman, Excite At Home's service was available
to 71 million homes worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Said Goldman, ``Our focus next year will be on execution,
getting more and more of the homes we pass to sign up for the
service.''

 &HT;    Coke stock makes comeback
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two tough days on Wall Street, Coca-Cola stock
rebounded Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose 50 cents to close at $60.50, getting a boost from
analyst Caroline Levy of Schroder &AMP; Co., who upgraded the stock to
``outperform significantly'' from ``outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who is not a fan of retiring Chief Executive M. Douglas
Ivester, also predicted the stock would rise to $76 within 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   The stock tumbled 12 percent over Monday and Tuesday after the
company announced that Ivester would retire as chairman and CEO in
April. He will be replaced by Douglas Daft, a 30-year company
veteran who was named president and chief operating officer until
he ascends to Ivester's job.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said Daft is ``the kind of guy who puts people at ease
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester has been criticized by Levy and other analysts for being
less diplomatic than he needed to be when dealing with important
problems, such as those with European regulators or Belgian
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical thing we see in Monday's announcement that Doug
Daft will become CEO is recognition that the company has been hurt
by a confrontational culture,'' Marc Cohen, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs, wrote Wednesday in a research report. ``He is also viewed as
politically savvy and a consensus builder.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Cohen added, ``this sudden leadership shift clearly raises
two issues that we expect to hang over this stock for awhile.''
Unlike Levy, Cohen rates the stock as a just a ``market
performer.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue, he said, is the ``likelihood of more management
turmoil over the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, he said, Coca-Cola ``will almost certainly now
name another No. 2 in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who was the No. 2 executive under the late Roberto
Goizueta, did not name a president and CEO when he rose to the top
spot. Many analysts believe that issue caused a disagreement
between Ivester and the board of directors, prompting Ivester's
decision to retire. The board then chose Daft to be president until
Ivester leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, however, was still very complimentary of Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Doug Ivester made an immeasurable contribution to the
Coca-Cola Co.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue that may contain the stock, Cohen said, is the
possibility that the new management may lower its ``customary
long-term growth objectives.'' They include annual case sales
growth of 7 percent to 8 percent and earnings per share growth of
15 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has said it will stick by its goals, even though
it has not been able to reach them lately.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those targets are hit again, some analysts do not
believe the company will be able to sustain the performance for
several years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect case sales to rise 5 percent next year,
compared with about 1 percent this year. And earnings per share,
which are likely to fall about 8 percent this year, are expected to
rise about 17 percent next year.

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced on Wednesday that
Israel and Syria would launch top-level peace talks here next week
after a nearly four-year suspension. He said both sides wanted to
reach an agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met with the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, in Damascus on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The final details were arranged in a series of phone calls on
Wednesday morning from Clinton to Assad, who said he would send his
foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, to Washington, and to the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, who will be the chief Israeli
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``These negotiations will be high-level, comprehensive, and
conducted with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Clinton told a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.
He called the decision of the two leaders to start negotiations ``a
significant breakthrough for it will allow them to deal with each
other face to face, and that is the only way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said there was no guarantee that the talks would
yield success, but said they left open the goal laid out by Barak a
few months ago: to seek a comprehensive peace settlement embracing
Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon by next September.
</P>
<P>
   One of the barriers to resuming the talks between Syria and
Israel, which broke off in early 1996 while Yitzak Rabin was
Israeli prime minister, has been an argument over what both sides
had agreed to when the talks stopped.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the past negotiations and the new talks is the
question of the return to Syria of the Golan Heights, which Israel
seized during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, as the possibility of talks have
been discussed and the administration has tried to find a formula
for their resumption, Assad has insisted that Israel agreed four
years ago to withdraw to the border that existed between the two
countries on June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have refused to agree to this precondition and have
said that the 1996 talks ended inconclusively on this point.
</P>
<P>
   The president said on Wednesday that both sides had agreed to
resume negotiations ``from the point where they left off,'' but
Clinton did not specify what that point was.
</P>
<P>
   This appeared to be a face-saving mechanism for both sides, and
Clinton declined to elaborate on the terms of the negotiations when
questioned during the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said in an
interview after Clinton's statement that ``everything'' would be on
the table next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``All issues will be on the table _ borders, security and the
nature of the peace,'' Berger said. ``These are the issues that
will be determined in the negotiations.'' Even though Assad was
sending his foreign minister, Assad ``will be the chief decision
maker,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of talk at lots of levels,'' Berger said.
``Now we've got Barak and the foreign minister on behalf of
Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Wednesday was the culmination of a series of
phone calls by Clinton _ 31 in all to Barak and Assad since August
_ and a letter from the president to Assad three weeks ago, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, Clinton gave a ``very strong argument that now's
the moment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Assad told Albright on Tuesday that he was prepared to respond
favorably to the letter and start negotiations where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Barak on Wednesday morning and told him of
Assad's willingness to talk, Berger recounted. The Israeli leader
suggested that the two sides start ``as soon as possible,'' an idea
that Clinton relayed to Assad by telephone. With the Syrian's
agreement to a prompt start, Clinton called Barak back to iron out
more details, Berger said.

 &HT;    Home Depot hammers home growth theme
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot wheeled out a war chest of growth plans at
its annual investors conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   From high-tech hammers to home improvement loans, the retail
giant made it clear that it's bent on getting bigger. And that
seemed to please nearly 200 analysts and investors who came to Home
Depot's headquarters to hear the message straight from the top
brass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a remarkable show of force,'' said analyst Dan Wewer
of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. ``Home Depot has always been clever
with its growth plans, but Wall Street rarely gets to meet the
managers behind those plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's immediate response sent the stock to a 52-week
high of $85.50 Wednesday. The stock closed at $84.30, up $1.05.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot had a captive audience at its Atlanta complex. Nearly
40 percent of the company's stock was represented at the two-day
meeting, said Ron Brill, executive vice president and chief
administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   Braced by a strong housing market, Home Depot has turned in
quarter after quarter of strong earnings growth in recent years.
With more than 900 stores currently, it plans to double in size in
the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at several current moves designed to boost sales:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tool rentals, which represent a $20 billion market, have
become a profitable test that will roll out to more markets. Home
Depot plans to operate roughly 400 of the rental centers inside
stores next year. The current 150-store test is popular with
contractors, Brill said.
</P>
<P>
   _ New proprietary products are designed to differentiate Home
Depot from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse
and other competitors. One of its newest brands is RoboHammer, a
shock-absorbent hammer with custom right- or left-hand grips.
</P>
<P>
   _ New home improvement loans are being tested at 60 stores and
will extend to all U.S. stores next year. Customers can obtain
unsecured credit lines up to $20,000 through two unidentified
lenders. Home Depot gets the origination fees, plus the loans tend
to inspire homeowners to spend more on projects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major appliances will be offered in most stores by the end of
next year through partnerships with General Electric and Whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its store growth, Home Depot's Internet strategy
has been a high-profile topic. Brill said that online product sales
would start next year with a city-by-city launch. The company is
still working on local product and pricing issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's strategy for contractors and professional customers
may present the biggest opportunity for growth, analyst Wewer said.
The company has been testing pro departments in several cities,
including Las Vegas, Chicago and Austin, Texas. In those tests,
Home Depot carries large quantities of commodity products, and it
staffs the stores with salespeople dedicated to the pro customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at those stores have risen 20 percent, far above the
annual sales increases at existing Home Depot stores, Wewer said.

 &HT;    Deal with MyWay.com gives BellSouth new Internet portal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth has become part-owner of MyWay.com in a deal
that will make that Internet portal the start page for BellSouth's
Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   For BellSouth, which is the Southeast's second largest Internet
service provider, the deal seems aimed at proving that BellSouth is
committed to the cutting-edge technologies that are likely to drive
the Internet in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   MyWay, which is owned by holding company CMGI Inc., offers a
site that can be customized to a user's tastes and interests, and
BellSouth plans to add a series of features that will be available
only to its subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies declined to say how much BellSouth is investing or
how much of MyWay.com BellSouth will own.
</P>
<P>
   However, the arrangement announced Wednesday provides for
BellSouth to receive part of the revenue from the Web portal, said
Bill Smith, BellSouth's chief technology officer. ``We do get to
share in the upside of helping MyWay to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, MyWay expects to get a boost to its revenue from
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The company, like many on the Net, makes much of its money from
advertising, as well as through deals with companies that have
links to its site. But the rates that can be charged depend on how
many visitors the site has, how often they view MyWay, how much
time they spend there and how much of the site they see.
</P>
<P>
   MyWay hopes for a quick boost as its Web site starts to enjoy
visits from BellSouth's 700,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have responsibility for the media half of this,'' said Jeff
Cunningham, MyWay president and chief executive officer. ``We give
the user simpler tools, faster access and _ we think _ a more
colorful experience. BellSouth is responsible for the feet on the
street of the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, MyWay has tried to eliminate requests for
information that could then be sold to advertisers. The tactic may
trim revenue opportunities for each user's visit, but MyWay hopes
the policy will bring users back more often, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a convenience-stores mentality, put into a strip mall,
so it's available on a 24-hour basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web page can be used by anyone on the Web, the
feature-enhanced version of the service is to be available to
BellSouth users by early February. Among the features to be added
are local information and the ability to interact with BellSouth
customer service through the page.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI Inc. is a Massachusetts-based holding company with dozens
of Internet start-ups beneath its umbrella, including Alta Vista
and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with BellSouth, in the works for several months, got
its start in informal talks between executives of the two
companies. An alliance with CMGI could offer BellSouth a chance to
include new Net technologies as they are developed.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and MyWay hope eventually to add unified messaging _
features that let users combine and track their voice mail and
e-mail messages. BellSouth also believes MyWay can be the core of
new services for users of wireless devices as well as BellSouth's
high-speed data lines.

   HEARST-MAGAZINES (New York) _ The Hearst Corporation says it has
agreed to sell Sports Afield magazine to SA Acquisition Corp. and
Motor Boating &AMP; Sailing magazine to Times Mirror Magazines.
Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, said that because
both magazines are highly specialized titles, Hearst sold them to
companies that are more focused on niche publications. By the

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ It is astounding to learn that
George McGovern, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1972 and
a leading critic of the Vietnam War that President Lyndon B.
Johnson escalated in the 1960s, now judges LBJ as one of the
greatest presidents since Abraham Lincoln. But as a reporter
covering Johnson in those days, I know what McGovern means. By

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely does anything between covers surprise a librarian like
Dennis Dillon, but he is astonished when he examines the latest
reports about reading patterns of students at the University of
Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation is down. Turnstiles are moving at a slower pace at
the most populous campus in the United States. But with a bare
minimum of promotion, the university's newly purchased electronic
books, like ``From Barbie to Mortal Kombat'' or ``Euthanasia: A
Reference Handbook,'' are suddenly circulating like freshly
published Grisham novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was sure whether anyone was going to read any digital
books,'' said Dillon, the university's head of collections and
information resources. ``We were somewhat skeptical. Usually a book
has a one-third chance of being checked out. So to have some title
checked out 25 times in two months _ that's shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $1 million budget for digital materials, the University
of Texas is preparing to increase its 6,000-title collection of
digital books. It is investing in the evolving electronic frontier
of the book market, which is preparing for rapid change despite
widespread doubt that the vast majority of readers are ready to
cuddle up to a good byte.
</P>
<P>
   New technology players like netLibrary _ which sells collections
of digital books to libraries _ are engaged in a frantic
international race to convert paper books to bytes with the
ultimate goal of dominating the evolving market.
</P>
<P>
   And traditional publishers are cautiously preparing for an
uncharted future, digitizing thousands of old backlist titles in
preparation for an e-new world where books can live forever,
because they will never go out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some publishing experts doubt that changes will come
rapidly, given the demographics of the American book market. The
most reliable and free-spending group of book buyers was raised on
paper. Those readers are edging into their mid-40s and up.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a number of major publishers in the United States
and in Europe are actively preparing for the possibility of a surge
in customer demand for electronic books that many believe could be
driven by the same type of readers that powered the paperback
revolution: the young.
</P>
<P>
   As the market develops, the very definition of a book is
evolving into an exotic collection of literary hybrids _ electronic
titles that can be read as e-mail, retrieved by a portable
electronic reading device, downloaded on a computer or converted
quickly from digital versions into bound copies that can be printed
in under 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And in the very near future, readers will be able to mince these
digital versions into customized titles available by the chapter or
page. For example, in the next six months, readers of IDG's Arthur
Frommer's travel guides will be able to create an electronic book
so narrow in scope that it explores restaurants in the Loire Valley
in France with reservation links to recommended hotels or airlines.
</P>
<P>
   With the immediacy of electronic books, digital titles can be
published at greater speed and with greater risk of unchecked
information. The forms of writing in electronic versions are
shifting, allowing authors to create never-ending electronic books
with constant revisions or expanded titles that include the
literary flotsam of notes, diary entries, memos, images and maps.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees when this new future will take hold.
Technology giants are boldly promising swift change, with Microsoft
predicting that many e-titles will outsell their paper cousins
within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Random House Inc. the United States' largest publisher, is not
making the same boasts, but it has embarked on a two-year project
to digitize all of the books on its backlist of 20,000 titles, with
5,000 already converted. Simon &AMP; Schuster is formatting all of its
new books in digital form and is preparing to digitize at least
4,000 of its 20,000 backlist titles next year.
</P>
<P>
   But because of security and piracy concerns, Simon &AMP; Schuster is
still reluctant to allow Microsoft access to its titles for use
with the company's new digital display software that will be
available next year for reading, searching and annotating books on
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a strategy for the future that is not
totally clear, because it's evolving and changing and converging at
the same time,'' said Jack Romanos, the head of S&AMP;S' consumer trade
division, which at this point has experienced electronic book sales
that total less than 0.1 percent of its sales. Still, he added,
``We believe there is an electronic future,''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the French publisher Havas and the Italian publisher
Mondadori announced agreements in October to publish electronic
books that can be read on the coming Microsoft Reader software and
downloaded from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Major European publishers of science, technical and medical
books have joined with U.S. publishers such as John Wiley &AMP; Sons to
electronically link citations in their journals _ a network that
ultimately could lead to links among electronic textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the leading U.S. bookseller, Barnes &AMP; Noble,
bought a 49 percent stake in iUniverse.com., a new electronic
vanity publisher in Campbell, Calif., that charges a modest fee to
would-be authors to post manuscripts in electronic versions.
</P>
<P>
   Such newcomers to the book industry are spread far from the
traditional capital of publishing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, these companies are caught up in a classic
chicken-and-egg dilemma. To attract readers they must offer a wide
variety of titles. But to persuade publishers to sell titles, they
have to demonstrate that there is a market and that the technology
is secure from piracy. As a result, many of the companies are
expanding their collections with titles that are in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   NetLibrary, for instance, has outposts in China, India and the
Philippines, where workers are converting books to electronic
copies by typing the text into computers. Scanning the material
directly into a computer posed too much potential for errors,
according to the company, so now the digital versions are copied in
other parts of the world and then edited and refined by ``book
builders'' at its rapidly expanding Boulder, Colo., headquarters,
where two shifts of employees work from 7 a.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The company is converting about 50 books a day, but the rate is
rising, said David Melancon, the company's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   A start-up with $105 million in new financing, netLibrary is
aggressively seeking to persuade major libraries to buy electronic
collections so that library users will have 24-hour access to
titles with full text searches. Since August, it has sold more than
$1.5 million in electronic books to libraries such as that of the
University of Texas, which bought 1,000 copies and acquired 5,000
more titles through consortium purchases.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, netLibrary's digital collection is dominated by
reference and scholarly titles from academic presses, but the
company intends to offer popular trade-book titles that could also
be available to individual users by subscription.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes how quickly the business is going to
change,'' Melancon said. ``And once it starts, having first mover
advantage is huge. The key to grabbing the market is having the
most content.''

 UNDATED: most content.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other Internet start-ups are expanding their offerings by making
publishing as democratic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain.com is an online seller of technical and computer books
that started a few years ago in a Silicon Valley garage. Last month
it announced the infusion of $20 million in venture capital to
support a publishing program that allows authors to sell their
works online for a 50 percent royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the appearance of such works as Richard
Bach's ``Air Ferrets Aloft.'' A Fatbrain.com summary describes the
title as ``the first widely published disclosure of the remarkable
activities of the world's domesticated ferret community, told
through the stories of outstanding individual animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon to come: ``Philosopher Ferrets in the Wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there is some uncertainty about whether this new
technology will produce a wider selection or simply digital slush.
</P>
<P>
   NetLibrary, for instance, will not accept any self-published
titles on its site. The company's view is that books have more
credibility when they are screened and filtered by professional
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowing people to post their titles,'' said
Melancon. ``If you do, it devalues the other books, because it
doesn't have credibility. Say I go to a Web site and I look up
books on low birth weight and prenatal care in developing
countries. I pull up a book by Sam Jones and I have no idea who Sam
Jones is.''
</P>
<P>
   The prices of netLibrary's books are the same as those of print
versions, but other companies are already starting to experiment
with e-book price discounts because of reduced costs for storage,
inventory and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Zero Heure, a French publisher founded two years ago, is able to
offer discounts for electronic titles that the Bertelsmann-owned
online bookseller Bol.Fr cannot match for printed versions because
of European rules regulating cover prices for conventional books.
</P>
<P>
   A minute after an order is placed, the electronic publisher will
e-mail some of the latest French best sellers at one-third off the
list price to American customers with no access to print versions
in stores here.
</P>
<P>
   Zero Heure is buying the electronic rights for print books, but
is also publishing its own original titles. Next month, for
instance, the company intends to publish ``Ici Kaboul,'' an ongoing
book about an Afghan woman's experiences in Kabul that will be
updated quarterly with new electronic chapters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's writing a chronicle of her life, and this could continue
as long as she wants,'' said Jean-Pierre Arbon, one of the
company's founders and the former managing director of Flammarion.
</P>
<P>
   This experimentation with literary forms has spread to nouveau
companies with no publishing experience such as CyberGold, an
e-commerce company that offers an array of digital products.
</P>
<P>
   This month, CyberGold featured its first electronic title,
``Dark Again,'' a thriller by David Saperstein, the author of the
book ``Cocoon,'' which inspired the movie of the same name. It is
available for $7.50 for the entire book or 50 cents a chapter. Each
chapter includes additional material _ from the assassin's
corporate memos to diary entries.
</P>
<P>
   One basic question that all these companies must confront is
whether readers will warm to the new forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, like netFind, are counting on a generation of
young readers, weaned on computers, who are ready to read on
screens. But as skeptics have pointed out, for years to come
companies will also have to reach the much larger group of older
readers to make the market viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 48, and for me I can't do it,'' confessed Dillon, who is
in charge of acquiring electronic titles for the University of
Texas. ``But my kids are in high school and they read books from
beginning to end on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his personal misgivings, he is betting on a generational
shift that will raise the popularity of e-books. He noted, for
example, that the library had expected that readers would be
interested only in electronic versions exploring computer topics.
But the taste in digital fare is far more eclectic, with readers
checking out titles from ``Art Ideology and Economics in Nazi
Germany'' to ``100 Years of Tomorrow: Brazilian Women's Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to put the money there, because we're guessing
that's what will happen,'' he said of student demand. ``It's
getting harder and harder to get them to go into their car to come
to the library.''

 &HT;    Bulls not cowed for new year, gurus say
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The greatest bull market in Wall Street history won't
end in the new year. That's the message from a group of stock
market gurus profiled by Money (December) in its special year-end
investment double issue.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Harry Dent Jr., whose book, ``The Roaring 2000s,''
argues that the aging baby boom generation will keep the bull alive
well into the next century. Another is Wharton scholar Jeremy
Siegel, whose ``Stocks for the Long Run'' demonstrates that stocks
have always outperformed bonds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   But Money cites weaknesses in their arguments, noting that they
don't agree with each other on certain key points. ``The only thing
that's certain'' says Money, ``is that after five years of almost
uninterrupted prosperity, we're in uncharted territory now. ...
Don't be too sure of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   TOO MUCH, TOO FAST?
</P>
<P>
   If the bull market appears safe, there are at least a few doubts
about the future of the ``new economy,'' according to Business Week
(Dec. 13).
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Jeffrey E. Garten cites a number of uncertainties that
could threaten the current business cycle. Among them is a
potential backlash in the marketplace against ``today's
mind-boggling pace of technological innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None other than Intel Chairman Andrew Grove worries that rapid
advances in the computer industry might not be digestible by
society, leading to lower consumer spending and lower corporate
investment,'' writes Garten.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA IS ON THE MAP
</P>
<P>
   Does location really matter to a growing business? Inc.
(December) says it does and ranks metro Atlanta as the third-best
location in the nation for a start-up or young company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success depends on the CEO's ability to marshal resources, and
many key resources are available only if the company is in the
right place,'' says Inc., which bills itself as ``the magazine for
growing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Among 50 large metropolitan centers ranked according to the
number of new companies over the last decade, Atlanta was behind
first-place Phoenix and second-place Salt Lake City-Provo.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Georgia cities were on Inc.'s list of the 50 best
``small metro areas'': Savannah, 4th place; Macon, 26th; and
Columbus, 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Atlanta came in fifth in Fortune's recent ranking
of the ``best cities for business,'' behind Dallas; San Jose,
Calif.; Austin, Texas; and New York.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE POST-MORTEM
</P>
<P>
   The Economist (Dec. 10) blames last week's protest in Seattle on
governments that ``have not merely failed to make the case for free
trade'' but have ``pandered to their (unappeasable) critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about trade and globalization deserve to be addressed,
the magazine says. If governments did that job properly, they would
tell people that trade ``makes people better off, especially the
poorest people in the poorest countries,'' and ``improves the
environment because it raises incomes,'' the magazine says.

KOSOVO WITHOUT ILLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two reports on Kosovo's intercommunal vendettas create a
historical record while memories are fresh. They also illustrate
how much easier it is to document atrocities than to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe compiled
the reports from interviews with Albanians, Serbs, and Gypsies from
Kosovo. One report recounts the cycle of violence that led to war
last March, when Serbia's ruler, Slobodan Milosevic, expelled
nearly the entire Albanian population of Kosovo and was forced to
surrender after Serbia's bridges, roads, and factories were smashed
by NATO bombers.
</P>
<P>
   The report elaborates on what the world already knows. It will
have an effect only if it teaches statesmen how to prevent such
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial lesson should be that the right time for
intervention was back in the summer and fall of 1998, when Serb
police and paramilitaries began assaulting Albanian villages and
driving civilians into the mountains in retaliation for the
guerrilla actions of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been possible then to initiate a genuine set of
negotiations _ not the disastrous American diktat presented to
Milosevic at the Rambouillet conference _ and to insert a large
contingent of outside monitors capable of protecting Albanian and
Serb civilians alike.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the two OSCE reports compiles testimony about the
vengeance that the KLA and Albanian Kosovars acting on their own
have taken against Serbs and Gypsies who stayed in Kosovo after the
war's end. The tragedy of a second ethnic cleansing in Kosovo _
this time of Serbs by Albanians _ is going on right now. It can
still be halted by muscular policing on the ground and political
pressure on the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The awful truth evident in the two reports compiled by the OSCE
is that the leaders of the United States and Europe were not wise
enough to act in time to protect the diverse peoples of the former
Yugoslavia.

WASHINGTON WROTE HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Washington had a sense of humor but wanted to hide it
from history. That's why a puckish letter he wrote to his
brother-in-law, Burwell Bassett, in 1762 is expected to boost
bidding into the stratosphere Thursday when it is auctioned off at
Christie's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page letter is valued at between $140,000 and $160,000 _
three to four times what Washington's more strait-laced
correspondence is worth. In the letter, 30-year-old Washington
tweaks Bassett for writing to him on a Sunday when ``you ought to
have been in church praying as becomes every good Christian Man who
has as much to answer for as you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, not a churchgoer, adds that his brother-in-law might
``behold with what religious zeal I hye me to Church on every Lords
day.''
</P>
<P>
   How refreshing to see the whimsy of a man most Americans think
of as a brilliant but tight-lipped icon. Washington engineered much
of that image, taking care to reveal little of a personal nature in
his writing.
</P>
<P>
   But in his unguarded moments he was a relatively fun guy.
Kenneth Bowling, co-editor of the First Federal Congress Project at
George Washington University, notes that the father of our country
liked to play cards, have drinks with friends, and was ``a
tremendous lady's man'' in his bachelor days.
</P>
<P>
   Such tidbits are fascinating to a culture that is inundated with
the most intimate details of current political lives. But even with
the media saturation, one wonders whether the public really knows
its national leaders and whether future generations will discover
clues that today's generation missed.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's pre-Revolutionary War letters were not considered
important by many 19th-century collectors _ the Bassett letter
languished in Europe for 100 years before a California collector
found it. Chris Coover at Christie's thinks there could be a lot
more ``wonderful Washington letters out there that haven't been
found.''
</P>
<P>
   Check the attic, and double-check misperceptions of a legend
that obscure the human being.

   ATLANTA _ Both England and Germany paid the price for poor form
since last summer's World Cup. This week, they were placed in the
same 2002 World Cup qualifying group.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 nations were placed in their respective FIFA draws
Tuesday in Tokyo, with the European side of the slate catching most
of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   England, which backed into Euro 2000 despite a lackluster
qualifying showing, lost to Germany both in the Euro '96 and the
1990 World Cup semifinals on penalty kicks. Playing a two-leg
series with the Germans, who twice lost to the United States this
year, will rule out such a dramatic conclusion in qualifying, which
begins next year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team is through to the Football Confederation (formerly
CONCACAF) semifinals, along with Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica.
The best bets to advance out of the opening rounds are Trinidad and
Tobago and El Salvador. The top three go to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 South American nations were not included in the draw
because theirqualifying consists of a single-group, 18-game
competition, with the top four advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's four strongest teams _ South Africa, Cameroon, Nigeria
and Ghana _ have relatively easy opening groups and should nail
down four of the continent's five berths. The other one could be
current African champion Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, becauseJapan and South Korea are automatic as co-hosts,
only two more teams are guaranteed places. The road could be a long
one for Saudi Arabia, which has made the past two World Cups.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, all nine group winners advance, along with defending
champion France, while the top eight runners-up will be redrawn to
determine four other places. Another runner-up will meet an Asian
team to select another spot.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise announcement, FIFA said it is moving up the next
Women's World Cup by a year to 2002, ostensibly to help promote the
event. It will take place in the fall, probably in Australia, only
a few weeks after the men are done.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS LEAGUE: KEANE CASHES IN
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United captain Roy Keane celebrated a lucrative
contract extension with the opening goal as the Red Devils thrashed
Valencia 3-0 on Wednesday to pick up its first three points in the
second round of group play.
</P>
<P>
   Keane, the Irishman who threatened to play abroad unless United
gave him a substantial raise, re-upped for four years at an
estimated $4.23 million per year, the largest such package in
England. His weekly salary of $81,500 is estimated to be Europe's
highest. Also on Wednesday, Barcelona pounded Sparta Prague 5-0,
Porto got a late goal to defeat Hertha Berlin, and Fiorentina and
Bordeaux played to a scoreless draw.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Real Madrid ignored its domestic league problems
with a 3-1 thrashing of Rosenborg Trondheim, while Chelsea got a
valuable point in Rome in a 0-0 draw with Lazio.Feyenoord dropped
Olympique Marseille 3-0, and Bayern Munich, missing numerous
injured and suspended players, held on to beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Champions League resumes on Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: CRUZ AZUL, AMERICA MEET
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City rivals Cruz Azul and Club America begin the first of
their two-leg Torneo Invierno semifinal series tonight. America,
the richest Mexican club, has not won a domestic title of any kind
since 1989. Cruz Azul has only one title since 1980, the 1997
Invierno. Tonight's game will be shown on tape delay at 11:30 p.m.
on Telemundo. In the other half of the draw, Atlas met Pachuca, an
upset winner over Toluca, in a late Wednesday game. The second legs
of both series will be on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: MADRID IN DANGER ZONE
</P>
<P>
   In charge not even three games, interim manager Vicente del
Bosque might be on his way out for Real Madrid, whose 5-1 thumping
by Zaragoza over the weekend was its worst home loss in 25 years.
Word is that president Lorenzo Sanz is angling to bring in another
former Madrid short-term boss, Jorge Valdano, for the rest of the
season. Sanz reportedly would like to lure Spain coach Jose Antonio
Camacho after Euro 2000. Madrid is in 17th place in the 20-team
Primera Division. GERMANY: OFFICER TO VISIT MATCH
</P>
<P>
   French police officer Daniel Nivel, left with permanent brain
damage after being beaten by German hooligans during the 1998 World
Cup, will be a guest of Kaiserslautern tonight as it entertains
Lens, his hometown club, in the UEFA Cup. Four young Germans were
sentenced to as many as 10 years in prison last month for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: RAVANELLI MOVES TO LAZIO
</P>
<P>
   Marseille forward Fabrizio Ravanelli has completed a one-year
transfer deal worth roughly $1 million to be a benchwarmer at
Lazio. The flamboyant, silver-haired Ravanelli figures he'll get
playing time with the Serie A leaders, because they also should
advance in the Champions League and the Italian Cup. He sought the
return to Italy to improve his chances of playing in Euro 2000.

FDA SAYS MAN KILLED IN GENE THERAPY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN
EXPERIMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Officials of the Food and Drug Administration
said Wednesday that they had concluded that Jesse Gelsinger, the
18-year-old Arizona man who lost his life in a gene therapy
experiment in September, was ineligible for the clinical trial and
should not have been treated because his liver was not functioning
well enough before doctors infused him with a dose of corrective
genes.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the preliminary results of a three-month inquiry
into Gelsinger's death, the officials also said the University of
Pennsylvania scientists running the study had violated FDA
requirements by failing to report immediately information about two
patients who, months before the death, had experienced serious side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   They said the informed-consent form that the investigators gave
patients deviated from the one the agency had approved, in that it
omitted information about the death of monkeys that had received a
treatment similar, although much more powerful, to the one given
Gelsinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the impact of these deviations are'' on
Gelsinger's death, said Dr. Kathryn Zoon, director of the agency's
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which monitors gene
therapy studies. But ``they're important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zoon added that when the agency concluded its inquiry, it
would take ``appropriate action,'' although she declined to say
what that action might be.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Wilson, the lead scientist for the Penn study,
vigorously defended his conduct. In interviews, Wilson, who directs
one of the most respected academic gene therapy programs in the
country, has said repeatedly that there was no evidence from either
animal or human testing that could have foretold Gelsinger's death.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement he read to reporters Wednesday, Wilson
maintained that at the time Gelsinger was enrolled in the study _
three months before he was treated _ blood tests showed that his
liver was functioning within the study's parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain fully comfortable'' with the decision to treat him,
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that he had not telephoned the FDA
immediately with information about the other patients' side
effects, Wilson said the agency had been given the data in writing
eight months before Gelsinger died. He did not address the issue of
the informed-consent form, and he did not take questions.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Gelsinger's treatment, aired in dueling news
conferences, lent a bizarre, circuslike air to the first day of a
three-day session of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the
National Institutes of Health panel that oversees gene therapy
research. The meeting room here was packed with scientists,
reporters and others, observers, including Gelsinger's father, who
sat in the back and quietly took notes on a yellow legal pad.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Paul Gelsinger, said he remained supportive of
the scientists at Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys didn't do anything wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is not scheduled to hear formal presentations from
Wilson and the FDA until Thursday. Inside the meeting room,
Wednesday's session stuck strictly to the agenda, as a parade of
gene therapy researchers reported about the safety and toxicity of
adenovirus, the weakened cold virus that was used as a ``vector''
to deliver healthy DNA to Gelsinger and the 17 other patients
treated in the Penn study.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the meeting, Wilson, trailed by press aides and a
lawyer, scrambled to figure out how to respond to the FDA's
allegations, first reported in a Washington Post article.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is likely to intensify concern over the conduct of
researchers in the field of gene therapy, a nine-year old field
that has had few treatment successes but, until the Penn study,
never resulted in the death of a patient. Officials at the advisory
committee have complained that some other gene therapy researchers
beyond Wilson have failed to make public their safety data, as NIH
guidelines require.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the committee will discuss new rules that will force
greater openness. That proposal has drawn criticism from the
biotech industry, which objects to a provision that would require
reporting of all deaths, even those unrelated to the treatment, as
well as the American Society for Gene Therapy, a scientists' group,
which said the rules are too cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be open,'' said Dr. Savio Woo, the society's
president, in an interview Wednesday. As to the FDA's findings, he
shrugged. ``What can I say? I don't want to sound defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Penn study has generated so much controversy is
that Jesse Gelsinger was not sick before he died. He suffered from
a mild form of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a rare,
hereditary metabolic disorder in which his liver was unable to
process ammonia, a toxic breakdown product of protein. When ammonia
builds up in the blood, it can travel to the brain, causing coma
and death; Gelsinger's ammonia levels were kept in check through
diet and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn gene therapy study was not designed to benefit people
like Gelsinger; it was to test the safety of a treatment for babies
with a fatal form of his disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the advice of medical ethicists, the Penn scientists
decided it was not proper to test the treatment on babies. So their
study called for stable adults, including female carriers of the
defective OTC gene and men, like Jesse, who had what scientists
call a ``partial enzyme deficiency,'' to receive the treatment: an
infusion of the adenovirus vector, with the OTC gene tucked inside
it. The infusion was given through the hepatic artery, to directly
to the liver.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and doctors who treat genetic disorders, including
some who reviewed the experiment for the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee, raised questions about the study's safety from the
outset, and those questions are being now being raised anew.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy experts have known for some time that adenovirus
provokes an immune system response that frequently includes high
fevers. In Gelsinger's case, his temperature rose to 104.5 degrees
the night after he received the gene infusion. Following the fever,
he experienced jaundice, then a blood clotting disorder. His
ammonia levels began to rise uncontrollably; he then suffered
kidney failure, lung failure and brain death.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Dr. Holmes Morton, an expert in
metabolic diseases who runs the Clinic for Special Children, a
nonprofit clinic in Strasburg, Pa., said there was enough evidence
about the side effects of adenovirus to raise serious doubts about
the wisdom of giving it to someone with OTC Deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said high fevers are particularly dangerous for someone
like Gelsinger, and might have triggered the subsequent reactions.
``Any time a patient with that disorder is stressed by illness, and
in particular anytime they develop a fever, their underlying
disease becomes not only unstable but life threatening,'' Morton
said. ``That, in a sense, is a quite predictable problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. W. French Anderson, the scientist who conducted the
first gene therapy experiment and who is regarded as the father of
the field, said he was convinced it was reasonable to proceed with
the experiment and that if there had been any lapses, in the end
``those will all turn out to be honest mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that in a busy lab, like Wilson's ``sometimes things
fall through the cracks. What this meeting is doing is to tighten
everything up.''

HOCKEY PLAYER, 15, IS CHARGED AFTER SERIOUSLY INJURING AN
OPPONENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Prosecutors have charged a 15-year-old youth league
hockey player with aggravated battery, saying he slammed an
opponent into the boards with his stick seconds after a game ended,
leaving the player partly paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Lake County state's attorney, George
Strickland, said Wednesday that in a Nov. 3 game in suburban
Northbrook, the 15-year-old, whose name was not released because he
is a juvenile, ``got up a head of steam'' as he skated toward the
opposing player, whose back was turned.
</P>
<P>
   The player who was charged was on the losing team, Strickland
said, and the injured player, Neal Goss, 15, of Glencoe, had scored
several goals. Goss has been unable to use the lower half of his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland also said that bystanders had told prosecutors that
the accused youth taunted Goss, saying, ``This is what you get for
messing.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Associated Press reported that Alan Kray, president of
the Northbrook Hockey League, which sponsored the game, said
several witnesses had thought there might still have been time left
in the game when the boy was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened within the context of the game,'' Kray said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges have renewed an old debate over whether the actions
of athletes on the arena ice or the playing field should be held to
the standards of criminal law. Only a handful of professional
athletes and coaches have been charged with crimes over the years,
and experts on sports say they do not know of any criminal charges
being filed in a youth sports event.
</P>
<P>
   The youth hockey player was charged with two counts of battery,
one for using ``a deadly weapon'' and the other for inflicting
``great bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Steinback, a lawyer for the player who was charged, said
prosecutors were wrong to treat the incident as criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious this isn't a crime,'' Steinback said. ``What's
being responded to is a tragic incident.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his client ``was upset from the beginning,'' adding,
``he's been devastated and wracked with feelings of remorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Players in the hockey league wear uniforms that bear the names
of their high schools, but the schools do not sponsor or sanction
the events.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic officials at New Trier Township High School, where the
injured boy is enrolled, and at Glenbrook North High School, where
the accused youth is a student, declined to comment on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   In professional hockey, prosecutors have brought charges in only
a relative handful of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The boxer, Mike Tyson, was suspended from boxing for biting an
opponent's ear off, but never faced criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, prosecutors in Kansas decided not to press
charges against Ben Christensen, a former Wichita State University
pitcher, for striking a batter near the on-deck circle in the face
with a thrown ball.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robinson, a professor of law at Northwestern University,
said the courts generally hold that participating in a violent
sport means consenting to violence, as long as the action is part
of what is deemed as a generally accepted part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when somebody is injuring somebody else clearly outside
the normal violence of the game, why shouldn't it be prosecuted?''
he said. ``Prosecutors rarely make such charges. Probably they
don't do it enough.''

IN HEAT-MOON'S LATEST SAGA, THE JOURNEY IS THE DESTINATION

   ``River-Horse: The Logbook of a Boat Across America''
</P>
<P>
   by William Least Heat-Moon
</P>
<P>
   Travel/Memoir
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $26
</P>
<P>
   John Steinbeck's ``Travels With Charley: In Search of America''
had held up pretty well for me. Discovered in adolescence, when the
urge to see the country was heavily upon me, ``Travels'' became a
book I periodically enjoyed rereading as a worthy surrogate for the
open road.
</P>
<P>
   That changed rather abruptly, however, after I read ``Blue
Highways'' by William Least Heat-Moon. ``Travels'' suddenly seemed
shabby, much as one's comfortable furniture suddenly suffers from
comparison with that of a better-off friend. Heat-Moon returns to
the travel narrative with his latest offering, ``River-Horse: The
Logbook of a Boat Across America.'' ``River-Horse'' is an engaging
account of Heat-Moon's 5,000-mile journey across the United States,
a trip made almost entirely by water aboard a small C-dory he named
Nikawa, a combination of the Osage words for ``river'' and
``horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the physical trip is compelling, ``River-Horse''
derives much of its strength from Heat-Moon's implicit
understanding that a cross-country adventure is as much a journey
into the mind as it is a trip across the physical landscape. The
interior forays are skillfully blended with accounts of the rivers,
land and people Heat-Moon confronts as he battles floods,
mosquitoes and flotsam across America. Heat-Moon's expedition, the
first of its kind, took him from New York Harbor to Astoria, Ore.
Along the way, he followed the routes taken by some of the nation's
pre-eminent explorers, including Henry Hudson and Lewis and Clark.
Liberally sprinkled with history and lore, ``River-Horse'' brings
the past alive while never losing a keen sense of the present. For
those who find it difficult to go to a shopping mall without
leaving in bewilderment that the United States has emerged as the
lone superpower, Heat-Moon provides a ready antidote with his
beautifully drawn celebrations of the humor and innate wisdom of
the so-called Common Man.
</P>
<P>
   Vignettes of his encounters with average Americans provide comic
relief and poignancy in the face of very real physical dangers. The
narrative is presented in trademark Heat-Moon style. His sentences
are like nesting dolls, a new surprise lurking behind each
successive word. The sentences almost become metaphors for the
trip: One never knows quite what to expect beyond the next comma,
just as Heat-Moon was unsure what he'd find around the next river
bend. One thing remains a certainty, however. Heat-Moon is still a
tad cranky about the homogenization of American culture and becomes
livid when confronted with littered landscapes. Such sentiments
will not ingratiate him with the chamber of commerce crowd but may
spur others to take a closer look at the consequences of our
one-use society.
</P>
<P>
   Heat-Moon's vast vocabulary is again on display, which no doubt
will draw Bronx cheers from some critics. I, for one, have never
felt it an author's duty to write to the lowest common denominator
and find no fault with Heat-Moon's approach. Most of the words that
many will find unfamiliar can easily be discerned from context, and
dictionaries remain a useful tool. Heat-Moon became something of a
literary sensation with the publication of ``Blue Highways,'' which
set him up as an important new voice in American letters. But his
next effort, ``PrairyErth,'' received a decidedly chilly reception,
622 pages about a sparsely populated county in Kansas apparently
being a bit too much for some. I happened to like ``PrairyErth,''
so much so that I put off my native Missourian's distrust of all
things Kansas and made a special trip through the tall-grass
prairie Heat-Moon had chronicled, and, for me at least, made come
alive.
</P>
<P>
   My own sentiments notwithstanding, the lack of critical acclaim
for ``PrairyErth'' significantly raised the stakes for
``River-Horse,'' with some believing that the latest work will make
or break Heat-Moon's reputation. His strength of voice, expert
characterization and vivid renderings of a truly remarkable and
fascinating voyage in ``River-Horse'' should bring accolades.
``River-Horse'' is a thoroughly enjoyable account of a journey and
of the American people.

CALIFORNIA'S MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER, AND CANDIDATES KNOW IT, BIG
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Call it the fire wall, the big state where Al Gore
and George W. Bush must stop any serious challenge to their
presumptive nominations for president.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the harbinger, the bellwether state where Republicans
and Democrats will first face each other on a single ballot in a
sign of their comparative appeal to the November electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the riddle, the sprawling state in which new electoral
rules and a speeded-up calendar make the usual dubious predictions
doubly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody in the political world seems inclined to call the
March 7 California presidential primary anything but important.
</P>
<P>
   In both parties, that contest will decide about 20 percent of
the delegates needed for the nomination, and the leading candidates
all have Californians in crucial roles in their campaigns. They all
have spent substantial time in the state, not only raising money
but also showing the flag in visits of up to 10 days at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, they all may be braving the winter rigors of Iowa
and New Hampshire, but come February, all hope to be here for
reasons considerably more compelling than their health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two ways of looking at California today,'' said
Gale Kaufman, former Sen. Bill Bradley's senior campaign adviser
here. ``That it's a really big state, and it's really, really
important, or that it's a really big state, and it's really, really
important after Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the polls show Bush with more support here among
Republican voters than all his Republican rivals combined and Gore
with more than twice the level of Democratic support that Bradley
draws. But the experts agree that those numbers could change
quickly, depending on what happens in New Hampshire on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, for the first time next year under a new system
passed by voters here, the presidential candidates in California
will compete in a blanket primary, in which the names of all
candidates will appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and
voters of any party may choose anyone they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``So even if one or both of the nominations has been settled by
California, there's an incentive for the nominee to work California
really hard to make that good showing,'' said Dan Schnur, a veteran
California Republican worker who is communications director for the
campaign of Sen. John McCain, whose best hope is that a strong
showing in New Hampshire might help him raise enough money to be a
viable competitor here in his neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   In a further wrinkle, because the rules of both national parties
have long required that convention delegates be chosen solely by
party members, primary voters in each congressional district will
be asked to use computer-coded ballots specifying their party. That
way, the overall vote can be broken down by party for purposes of
selecting delegates. That conceivably means that one candidate _
say Bradley, with his potential appeal to crossover voters _ could
win more total votes than Gore, while Gore won the partisan contest
for actual delegates, sending a mixed message on a day when voters
in New York, Georgia, Ohio and most of New England will also choose
delegates. (On the Republican side, the winner of the most
Republican votes takes all a state's delegates, while Democratic
rules divide them proportionally.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have Bradley and McCain finish one and two over all
and the other two finish three and four, but win the delegates,''
said Bill Carrick, a leading Democratic consultant here who gets
calls seeking advice from both the Gore and Bradley campaigns. ``I
don't know. That would be a meltdown in pundit-land, in which
they'd all say, `Now, to the definitive results in the Georgia
primary.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These days, the candidates are mostly conspicuous by their
absence, as Californians, not especially attentive to politics even
in the heat of campaigns, focus on the coming holidays and the
contenders work the coffee shops in colder climes. But their
campaigns are buzzing below the radar with varying degrees of
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, the McCain camp announced that it had added
Ken Khachighian, a California Republican strategist who has worked
on seven presidential campaigns dating back to Richard M. Nixon. On
Friday, the Bush campaign officially opened its statewide
headquarters in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Gore has locked up the support of most
of the state party establishment, and a major health-care workers
union, but some of his supporters worry that his operation here has
not been as vocal or as visible as it should be, compared with
Bradley's, which has offices in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los
Angeles and is led by Ms. Kaufman, a longtime Democratic consultant
who has scored some major successes in union campaigns in recent
years. Bradley's national campaign manager, Gina Glantz was raised
and cut her teeth in New Jersey politics, but for more than a
decade has lived in San Francisco, before leaving to run Bradley's
presidential campaign from its New Jersey headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's point person in California is Kathy Bowler, who has been
the executive director of the state Democratic Party and, until
recently, was still working out of the party's offices in
Sacramento. But she has now established a Gore 2000 office there,
and another is to open soon in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common complaint here about the Gore campaign from Day 1
has been that there was not enough of a physical presence on the
ground to keep people feeling tied in, and as if they were an
integral part of the campaign,'' said Garry South, the senior
political strategist for Gov. Gray Davis, who long ago endorsed
Gore. ``I think everyone involved is aware of that. Part of the
problem has obviously been that the Gore campaign was spending
money at too rapid a pace, and nobody wanted to spend any more here
right now. But this is California, and this is really the fire wall
for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore staff members say they have suffered from comparisons with
President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, when he ran
unopposed in the primaries and state party money helped pay for a
network of offices around California.
</P>
<P>
   They say that they fully expect Gore to ``become a resident'' of
California by February, as one senior aide put it. The campaign's
national press secretary, Chris Lehane, said Gore was positioned
``very well in California,'' because his policies on such issues as
opposition to further offshore oil-drilling, support for gun
control and abortion rights ``translate into good politics in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   South, the California governor's adviser, said he was hopeful
that the Gore forces would soon step up their efforts, but there is
some irony in his complaint, since Gore has taken particular pains
to woo California, which Clinton reclaimed for the Democrats in
1992 and which remains vital to any Democratic strategy for
retaining the White House. As vice president, Gore has visited the
state more than 60 times and named a former California congressman,
Tony Coelho, as his national campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But both Bradley and Bush have been outpacing Gore in
fund-raising in the Silicon Valley, and in Hollywood, prominent
Bradley supporters like the entertainment moguls Barry Diller and
Michael Eisner have done much to take the shine off Gore's support
from other stars and executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The twin pillars of Bill Clinton's support here have always
been Silicon Valley and Hollywood, and neither of those communities
has been terrifically enthusiastic about Al Gore,'' said Schnur,
the McCain adviser who was a senior aide to former Gov. Pete
Wilson. ``So what do you have left? Gore's running a campaign
oriented toward the traditional Democratic constituencies'' like
labor, minorities and women. ``He's running an organizational
campaign in a state that isn't very organizational.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bradley made a great show last summer of
taking a 10-day tour of the state, talking casually with
grass-roots groups in an effort to introduce himself, and although
his aides profess success in drawing volunteers, their candidate
has hardly surged in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last guy who said he was going to spend a lot of time and
meet people in California was Al Checchi,'' said Kam Kuwata, a
senior adviser to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, recalling the maverick
millionaire businessman who staged an expensive but spectacularly
unsuccessful race for the Democratic nomination for governor last
year. ``He did nothing but go around the state for a whole year,
and met several thousand people. Well, several thousand people is
nothing in this electorate. And I don't think even presidential
primary voters here will be tuned in until after the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the conventional wisdom here is that the only way to run
statewide campaigns is with widespread television advertising. But
the rates are so high _ about $1.5 million to run an advertisement
that would be seen 10 times by a typical viewer _ that no one here
expects candidates to go on the air until a couple of weeks before
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to see one of those campaigns where you've got
the bio ad and the issue-framing ad and you run five ads before you
get around to doing anything,'' said Carrick, the consultant. ``It
will be the opposite of Iowa and New Hampshire: short on
organization and long on whirlwind media campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, California held its primary in June, and once upon a
time it was pivotal. But in recent years, the accelerated national
primary schedule left California an afterthought, so the state
moved up the date, first to late March and then to the beginning of
the month, only to find other states leapfrogging as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already seen the impact,'' said state Sen. James Brulte,
a Republican from San Bernardino County who recently stepped down
as state co-chairman of the Bush campaign, with the candidate's
encouragement, to become finance chairman of the debt-ridden state
Republican Party in an effort to build its ability to compete next
fall. ``Candidates have been crisscrossing the state for months.
It's no coincidence that George W. picked California as the venue
for announcing not only his first major education speech but his
first foreign policy speech.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate impact remains anybody's guess. In the words of
Davis' strategist, South: ``This is really terra incognita.''  &QL;

A MUSICAL MARCH THROUGH AN EVENTFUL ERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For good reasons, Deutsche Grammophon's Centenary Collection is
heavily concentrated in the decades after World War II, a period
including the history of the LP and the boom time of the CD.
</P>
<P>
   In these years, recording fidelity started from a high plateau
and generally climbed, and political and social side issues
gradually fell by the wayside. The performers are now better known
if not necessarily more distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material here will be familiar to collectors of my
postwar generation. The conductor Ferenc Fricsay, for example,
looms as large as Wilhelm Furtwangler, and the violinist Wolfgang
Schneiderhan as large as David Oistrakh. Five big boxes present a
year-by-year march through the last half-century in 10 entries
each, with a CD or, in opera, a two-disc set representing a single
composer, work, performer or group.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the first postwar set (459 067-2) ranges from Monique Haas
playing Ravel and Stravinsky piano works in 1948 to Lorin Maazel
conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in Berlioz, Tchaikovsky and
Prokofiev in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Fricsay and Igor Markevitch also conduct, Scheiderhan and
Oistrakh play, and a young Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings. But to a
listener who learned much of his Bach from the Deutsche Grammophon
standby Karl Richter in the '60s and '70s, one of the more
fascinating items here is Bach as yet untouched by the early-music
movement: the first two cantatas of the ``Christmas Oratorio,''
with Fritz Lehman conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the obvious in the next set (459 068-2, ranging from
1958 to 1967) _ Karajan leading the Berlin Philharmonic in
Beethoven, Karl Bohm conducting Mozart and Richard Strauss, and
Wilhelm Kempff playing Beethoven piano works _ an inevitable sense
of arbitrariness arises with the 1967 disc devoted to the guitarist
Narciso Yepes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the producers unerringly pluck the highlight
from Eugen Jochum's set of Bruckner symphonies: the Seventh in a
glowing performance by the Berlin Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Grammophon's catalog has become so rich and diverse in
recent decades that even in a selection this vast, the sense of
arbitrariness takes firmer hold in the later sets. Contemporary
music, for example, is represented only by Hans Werner Henze's
Symphonies Nos. 5 and 6 (in 459 069-2, running from 1968 to 1977)
and Leonard Bernstein's theater music (in 459 070-2, from 1978 to
1987); the years 1988 to 1997 (459 071-2) offer nothing. And opera
ranges narrowly, with two discs from Karajan's ``Ring'' (1969),
Carlos Kleiber's ``Traviata'' (1977) and Carlo Maria Giulini's
``Falstaff'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   But there are many treasures along the way: the pianist Martha
Argerich in the Chopin Preludes (1975); the violinist Gidon Kremer
in concertos by Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky (1979); Vladimir
Horowitz's Moscow recital (1986); the pianist Krystian Zimerman in
Chopin and Liszt (1987); Pierre Boulez conducting Debussy and
Stravinsky (1991); the Emerson String Quartet in Beethoven (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Should a collection like this present the best or merely the
most typical of the company's labors? In the end, of course, it's
Deutsche Grammophon's party, and the label can represent itself as
it likes, a fact that makes all the more remarkable some decisions
in the earlier material: the ``Great Voices'' box discussed above
and, particularly, ``The Early Years'' (459 065-2), which in five
discs sweeps from 1898 to 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The set begins innocuously with the voice of Emile Berliner, the
company's founder, recorded in 1898. The same disc, ``Recording
Pioneers,'' offers vocal numbers by Enrico Caruso with and without
Nellie Melba, who on her own sings ``Auld Lang Syne,'' appropriate
to the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Three discs of orchestral, concerto and solo and chamber
recordings give little cause for offense beyond the inclusion of
Strauss' soulless ``Japanese Festival Music,'' conducted by the
composer in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   But the fifth disc offers a shocking Mozart Requiem, with Bruno
Kittel conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 1941. Even listeners
aware that texts were bowdlerized to suit the Nazi regime may be
unprepared for the visceral impact of hearing them.
</P>
<P>
   All references to the Jewish roots of Christianity are purged.
``Quam olim Abrahae promisisti'' (``As was promised to Abraham'')
becomes ``Quam olim homini promisisti'' (``As was promised to
man''). ``Deus in Sion'' (``God in Zion'') becomes ``Deus in
coelis'' (``God in heaven'').
</P>
<P>
   The scrupulous liner notes quote a craven 1940 article in the
redoubtable journal Zeitschrift fur Musik: ``Mozart's Requiem is
the most profound and deeply moving of all Masses for the Dead that
are dedicated to the memory of the dearly departed and should not
be allowed to languish in obscurity simply because of a handful of
passages in the text that are unsuited to our age.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in its sheer perversity, this practice yields the most
disturbing _ and ultimately, in its inadvertent way, ``deeply
moving'' _ document in the entire collection.

ROSE BOWL COACHES MEET THE PRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The countdown to Rose Bowl Y2K began in
earnest Wednesday morning as coaches Tyrone Willingham of Stanford
and Barry Alvarez of Wisconsin spoke to the media about their
teams, their strategy and the Jan. 1 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game will be a fitting bookend to an exciting century of
football in Pasadena,'' said Ken Burrows, president of the
Tournament of Roses Association, which has sponsored the game since
1902.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the business-as-usual nature of Wednesday's
get-together at Tournament House, the circumstances were a bit
unusual. Alvarez, recovering from knee surgery three weeks ago,
appeared as a talking head on a television monitor via satellite
from Madison, Wisc. He remained home on doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham, whose Cardinal is making its first Rose Bowl
appearance since 1972, appeared in person. He sat at a table next
to the television beaming Alvarez's image across the country.
Alvarez's Badgers are making their third Rose Bowl appearance since
1994. But, for the first time, they enter the game as favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 4 in the nation, the Big Ten champion Badgers rode
the powerful legs of Heisman Trophy candidate Ron Dayne to the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, ranked No. 22, got there on the strength of the
Pac-10's top-rated offense. But it also took a little help from a
faltering University of Washington, which lost two conference
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 1 match-up resembles the 1999 game when the Badgers
took on and dismantled UCLA's high-powered attack.
</P>
<P>
   The key in Y2K will be Dayne, the NCAA Division I career rushing
leader. To win, Stanford will need to stop Dayne. It's not going to
be an easy task, Willingham admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is a method or a system to stop Ron
Dayne,'' Willingham said. ``What we would hope to do is slow him
down . . . I don't know if anybody has the ability to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Willingham praised the Badgers for their balanced
attack on offense and defense. He noted that Dayne isn't the sole
reason for Wisconsin's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get to three Rose Bowls with just being a one-person
show,'' Willingham said. ``They are an extremely talented, complete
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez doesn't expect Wisconsin to have an easy time with
Stanford. He compared the Cardinal's passing attack to Michigan's
and noted that the Wolverines passed for 257 yards and a pair of
touchdowns in their win over the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have some excellent skill players,'' Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season it appeared that neither Stanford (8-3) nor
Wisconsin (9-2) had much chance of reaching the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers began the season with easy wins over Murray State
and Ball State only to lose to Cincinnati (17-12) and Michigan
(21-16) in consecuitive weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Through that difficult time, Alvarez said he tried to keep his
team focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tried to emphasize was improvement,'' he said. ``The
bottom could have fallen out, but we still felt we were a good
football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's start was even shakier. The team's first game was a
69-17 loss to Texas. But the Cardinal seemingly redeemed itself
with wins over Pac-10 rivals Washington State, Arizona and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Then the team sank to an another low a 44-39 loss to San Jose
State.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to navigate those difficult waters was to ``focus
on our next ballgame and what we could do to keep ourselves in the
best light,'' Willingham said.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Day will be the first Rose Bowl meeting of Wisconsin
and Stanford. The Badgers have made five appearances and compiled a
2-3 record. The Cardinal has been to 11 Rose Bowls and is 5-5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams have met four times; Wisconsin holds a 3-0-1
advantage. Their last meeting was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will arrive in the Southland and begin practice the
week before the game.

UCLA, PEPPERDINE READY TO DO BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two local schools, UCLA and Pepperdine, will
square off in two different sports. In each case, one eagerly
awaits the matchup more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   The women's volleyball teams have reached the NCAA Sweet 16 and
meet today at 2 p.m. PST at Penn State. UCLA has wanted a shot at
the Waves since Pepperdine overcame a two-game deficit and beat the
Bruins Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge for retribution is captain Elisabeth Bachman.
She hasn't hit below .450 in the last 11 matches and her .441
percentage this season ranks second nationally. Against Pepperdine,
Bachman had 14 kills in 21 attempts with three errors _ a .524
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure we come out strong and stay strong,''
Bachman said. ``Once the match starts, everyone wants to make sure

 &HT;    King trial closes with conspiracy verdict
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ For the family of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., vindication came swiftly Wednesday after a 31-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after they started deliberating, a civil trial jury
of six blacks and six whites found that Loyd Jowers, the former
owner of a small-time greasy spoon restaurant, was guilty of being
part of a conspiracy to kill King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like triumph over tragedy,'' said Dexter Scott King.
``The fact that 12 independent jurors have spoken is all we've
wanted and we've ever asked for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a period at the end of a chapter for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   King's widow and her four children were awarded $100 in damages,
to go toward funeral costs. Dexter King said the family will donate
the money to a charity to benefit Memphis sanitation workers, since
it was their plight that brought his father to Memphis when he was
gunned down April 4, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was not about money, the Kings have said since filing
the civil suit against Jowers last year. Instead, the family wanted
a jury to hear evidence that King was not killed solely by James
Earl Ray, the escaped convict who pleaded guilty in March 1969 but
recanted three days later.
</P>
<P>
   By pleading guilty, Ray never faced a jury. He died in April
1998 of liver disease while serving a 99-year sentence and still
insisting he was set up by a mysterious smuggler he only knew as
``Raul.''
</P>
<P>
   Although King's assassination has been investigated by federal
and Tennessee authorities, this was the first time a jury had
listened to any evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very gratifying to be given a opportunity before a
jury,'' said King family attorney William Pepper, who also
represented Ray in his final attempts to win a trial. ``This is all
James Earl Ray wanted. At least the family will benefit from this.
Most of the evidence that we presented would have been put forth in
a trial for Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Juror David Morphy said he thought the assassination was too
complex to be accomplished by one person.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all thought it was a cut-and-dry case, with the evidence
that Pepper brought forth that there were a lot of people involved.
Everyone from the CIA to the military had involvement in it,'' said
Morphy. ``Jowers was involved in it, we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 90-minute closing argument Wednesday, Pepper talked about
conspiracies, cover-ups and Jowers' admission on nationwide
television that he was a part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, who owned Jim's Grill cafe in the same building where
Ray rented a room on the day of the shooting, told ABC News in 1993
that he received $100,000 to hire a hitman to kill King. The rear
of Jim's Grill was across the street from the Lorraine Motel, where
King was staying and was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers said he got the money from Memphis produce dealer Frank
Liberto, who has been tied to a New Orleans organized crime family.
According to Pepper, the hitman was Earl J. Clark, a now-deceased
Memphis police officer who had won honors at the FBI Academy for
his sharpshooting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Although parts of Jowers' story have changed over the years, he
said the assassin fired his shot from behind Jim's Grill and then
handed Jowers the still-smoking gun to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' attorney, Lewis Garrison, said the lawsuit should have
been dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.
Garrison contended the Kings should have filed the lawsuit around
the time of Jowers' TV appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Garrison said, while it might be reasonable to conclude
that King was the target of a conspiracy, any role Jowers could
have played would have been minor.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison told the jury it was hard to believe that ``the owner
of a greasy spoon and an escaped convict'' could have pulled off
King's assassination. Jowers, who at 73 is suffering from cerebral
arteriosclerosis, was absent from court for most of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's verdict was welcomed by some spectators, including
Charles A.L. Oliver Jr., who said he has listened to every word of
the monthlong trial since the second week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a vested interest in finding the truth. I always felt
there was a conspiracy,'' said Oliver, 43. ``Now we can be free and
get on with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For many in Memphis, the end of the trial brought closure for
them personally.
</P>
<P>
   Tending his niece's gift shop on Beale Street, Lafayette Davis
said he delivered bread to the Lorraine Motel the day King was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about the trial because people want to
know what happened,'' said Davis, who has lived in Memphis since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   He said he missed King the morning of the assassination so he
and a friend went to the home of the Rev. Samuel B. Kyles to meet
King, who was to have dinner with the Kyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were waiting at Kyles' house for King,'' said Davis. ``He
never made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neady Masters never got to meet him, either. On the stormy night
of April 3, Masters' sister saw King's ``I've Been to the
Mountaintop'' sermon at Mason's Temple. She told Masters how
inspiring it was and that she felt electricity after touching King.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I had to go see him,'' said Masters, 57, adding
that on April 4, she and a friend headed to the motel to meet King.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, traffic was bad that day, so my friend turned
around,'' said Masters. ``As we were driving back, we heard on the
radio that he had been shot. We could have been there. Had I been
driving, we would have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why she has been at the trial. She sat intently through
most of the proceedings. During breaks, she talked to members of
the King family, telling stories and taking pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hear the truth,'' said Masters. ``I have children
and grandchildren and I want them to hear and see history. And to
know the feel of the Kings. To feel the electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial will have wide-ranging effects, Dexter King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will have to be rewritten,'' he said. ``People can no
longer look the other way.'' Outside the courtroom Wednesday
morning, about 100 schoolchildren walked around with signs reading,
``Who killed Martin Luther King.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at LeMoyne-Owen College, the only historically black
college in Memphis, Clodetra McGee and Samantha Mitchell, both
freshmen, said they have been living with theories about the
assassination since birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should find out who really killed Dr. King, so
that he can rest in peace,'' said Mitchell, 19. ``I never thought
James Earl Ray did it. I always thought it was a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, a prosecutor with the Shelby County district
attorney general's office who has investigated the assassination
but was not involved in the Jowers trial, said the conspiracy
claims have no merit. Campbell said several of Jowers' friends and
associates said he was merely hoping to get a movie or book deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at this off and on for five years,'' Campbell said,
``and I've still seen nothing that would change my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a limited
investigation by the Justice Department into two allegations of a
conspiracy. One was Jowers' possible involvement; the other was a
claim by former FBI Agent Donald Wilson that he found papers when
Ray's Ford Mustang was found in Atlanta after the assassination
that would support a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Carol Florman said Wednesday the
review is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   Headed back to Atlanta to prepare for an 11 a.m. news conference
at the King Center, Dexter King said he hopes the verdict silences
critics who bashed the family's pursuit of Jowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the critics, you would hope they will be converted or
be able to admit they were wrong,'' King said. ``For my family,
this is the end of the road. Our final legal remedy. I think my dad
would be proud of us.''

GOLDMAN SACHS TO FOCUS ITS FOUNDATION ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., which set aside $200 million
from its public stock offering earlier this year to endow a new
foundation named after the company, said Wednesday that the
institution would focus exclusively on education.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that former co-chairman John Whitehead
would serve as chairman of the new entity, which will be the sixth
largest corporate foundation in the country and be called the
Goldman Sachs Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Bell-Rose, the former counsel at the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation and an expert on underachieving minority students, was
named as president.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs chairman and chief executive Henry Paulson said
that while there was debate on how much money to put into the
foundation _ one proposal called for $350 million _ there was no
debate on the focus on education. He said that $200 million was
seen as ``enough to make a difference.'' If it turns out not to be
enough, he said, more money can be added.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has raised about $3.7 billion in its stock
offering, said that its executives will match the new foundation's
giving in the first year and possibly in the future years.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is being created as financial markets and
corporate profits have been rising but corporate philanthropy has
remained flat. Whitehead recently teamed up with actor Paul Newman
and about three dozen corporate executives to press companies to
raise their giving.
</P>
<P>
   Several philanthropy experts said Wednesday that while it is not
unusual for newly wealthy executives to give money to charity, they
could not think of another example in which a company had set up a
foundation out of the earnings of a public stock offering, as
Goldman has.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's independence from the Goldman Sachs corporation
also is unusual. Three of the foundation's initial seven trustees
will be Goldman executives. But Whitehead said the foundation's
bylaws do not require that representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty rare to find a foundation set up in the name of a
company that isn't under its control,'' said Curt Weeden, a former
corporate philanthropy executive who now runs the Corporate
Contributions Management Academy in Palm Coast, Fla., which runs
programs on corporate philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said that there were advantages to working closely
with Goldman while remaining free to make independent decisions.
Ms. Bell-Rose said the foundation plans to make a small number of
large gifts each year in the United States and abroad, and will
probably give ten $1 million grants, each matched by Goldman Sachs,
next year. The foundation's new trustees also will include John
Thornton, Goldman's president, and Thomas Payzant, superintendent
of the Boston public schools.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced on Wednesday that
Israel and Syria would launch top-level peace talks here next week
after a nearly four-year suspension. He said both sides wanted to
reach an agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met with the Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, in Damascus on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The final details were arranged in a series of phone calls on
Wednesday morning from Clinton to Assad, who said he would send his
foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, to Washington, and to the
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, who will be the chief Israeli
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``These negotiations will be high-level, comprehensive, and
conducted with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Clinton told a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.
He called the decision of the two leaders to start negotiations ``a
significant breakthrough for it will allow them to deal with each
other face to face, and that is the only way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said there was no guarantee that the talks would
yield success, but said they left open the goal laid out by Barak a
few months ago: to seek a comprehensive peace settlement embracing
Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon by next September.
</P>
<P>
   One of the barriers to resuming the talks between Syria and
Israel, which broke off in early 1996, has been an argument over
what both sides had agreed to when the talks stopped.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the past negotiations and the new talks is the
question of the return to Syria of the Golan Heights, which Israel
seized during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, as the possibility of talks have
been discussed and the administration has tried to find a formula
for their resumption, Assad has insisted that Israel agreed four
years ago to withdraw to the border that existed between the two
countries on June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have refused to agree to this precondition and have
said that the 1996 talks ended inconclusively on this point.
</P>
<P>
   The president said on Wednesday that both sides had agreed to
resume negotiations ``from the point where they left off,'' but
Clinton did not specify what that point was.
</P>
<P>
   This appeared to be a face-saving mechanism for both sides, and
Clinton declined to elaborate on the terms of the negotiations when
questioned during the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said in an
interview after Clinton's statement that ``everything'' would be on
the table next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``All issues will be on the table _ borders, security and the
nature of the peace,'' Berger said. ``These are the issues that
will be determined in the negotiations.'' Even though Assad was
sending his foreign minister, Assad ``will be the chief decision
maker,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of talk at lots of levels,'' Berger said.
``Now we've got Barak and the foreign minister on behalf of
Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Wednesday was the culmination of a series of
phone calls by Clinton _ 31 in all to Barak and Assad since August
_ and a letter from the president to Assad three weeks ago, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, Clinton gave a ``very strong argument that now's
the moment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Assad told Albright on Tuesday that he was prepared to respond
favorably to the letter and start negotiations where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Barak on Wednesday morning and told him of
Assad's willingness to talk, Berger recounted. The Israeli leader
suggested that the two sides start ``as soon as possible,'' an idea
that Clinton relayed to Assad by telephone. With the Syrian's
agreement to a prompt start, Clinton called Barak back to iron out
more details, Berger said.

<P>
   ZNAMENSKOYE, Russia _ The brutish war in Chechnya is alternately
portrayed as Russian troops trying to put down ``terrorists'' or
freedom-loving Islamic rebels seeking to throw off Russian
domination. But there are no heroes in Znamenskoye.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have forced their way into this town in northwest
Chechnya, but have also brought a measure of stability, townspeople
say. The militants may include Chechen patriots, they add, but they
also have among them thieves and adventurers from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   People here say they have often felt caught in the middle and
abused by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the fate of Znamenskoye, a cheerless town of about 6,000
people that has passed from Russia's dominion to the control of the
breakaway Chechen government in Grozny _ and now back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian presence is simply a reality now,'' Ibrahim
Sultakhanov, 40, the director of the town's Secondary School No. 2,
said with a sense of fatalism. ``What people really want is
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The baleful tale of Znamenskoye is a part of Chechnya's tangled
history. Chechnya is a republic in which clans and village ties
often play a decisive role, and Znamenskoye has sometimes found
itself the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Many of residents in this agricultural region were never
enthusiastic backers of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the first president of
the first breakaway Chechen republic who was born in poor family in
southern Chechnya and died in a Russian airstrike in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of northern Chechnya, Znamenskoye's proximity to
Russian territory has made it less hostile to Moscow than the
capital of Grozny and southern Chechen regions. But while its new
Russian masters are hoping to turn the town into a showcase of how
Chechens can live contently under Moscow's rule, it will take a lot
of work to change the weary resignation of Znamenskoye's residents
into loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the Russians bring order here?'' said a 25-year-old
saleswoman in Znamenskoye's bedraggled marketplace who gave her
name only as Medina. ``Just look at the television. They can't even
run their own country. It looks like a war is going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, life in this town was difficult even under Chechen
rule. After Chechnya won its de facto independence in 1996,
teachers went without salaries, surviving on small hand-outs from
the equally impoverished parents of their students.
</P>
<P>
   The problems were not just a matter of money. Once in power, the
Chechen authorities in Grozny imposed their own brand of
domination. Sharia, or Islamic Law, became a required subject at
Znamenskoye's Secondary School. The Chechen government began a
long-term program to substitute Chechen in the classroom for
Russian, a language people here see as essential for their children
to prosper beyond Chechnya's narrow borders.
</P>
<P>
   When teachers were accredited, Chechen authorities were more
interested in their political background than in their teaching
skills, Sultakhanov, the school director, recalled ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Life outside the school was harder still. Znamenskoye, as with
much of the rest of Chechnya, was a dangerous place. Sultakhanov's
cousin was kidnapped by one of the lawless bands that roam the
countryside, a common crime. He was returned for a hefty ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we have independence if it means marauders can just
run around the place,'' said Arbi, 34, a Chechen Interior Ministry
official from the nearby town of Naur who declined to give his last
name. ``We are not ready for this stage of development.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also far from clear that they are ready for the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the hearts and minds of Znamenskoye's residents is the
task of Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Kovrov, the Russian military
commandant of the Nadrerechny district, the region of 50,000 that
is administered from Znamenskoye. The population of Nadrerechny is
overwhelmingly Chechen and only 47 ethnic Russians still reside in
the region, Kovrov said.
</P>
<P>
   Kovrov strolls through the town like a small-town mayor,
accompanied by two gun-toting bodyguards, promising help and
fielding complaints. The townspeople are of all ages, and include
young men who do not fight for either side.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been some changes at the secondary school. It
now uses a Russian curriculum, which is fine with many parents who
fear that their young children may loose the ability to speak
Russian and perhaps one day attend the university there. And at the
parents request the foreign language their children are being
taught is no longer Arabic but English.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have also received three months of back wages, at a
rate of 700 rubles, or $26, a month. Pensioners received a
260-ruble stipend for November, or about $10, a pittance but the
first pension residents have received in years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a crying need for food, clothes and other
assistance, despite donations from some Russian regions. To try and
rejuvenate the economy, Kovrov used the proceeds from traffic fines
and phone calls to start a local bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be absolutely legal to open a bank without a
license,'' said Kovrov. ``But we have to do something to start
normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everything, however, has gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Residents complain that even when they have proper documents and
passes Russian troops demand bribes at checkpoints outside town.
Medina, who travels to the Russian cities of Mozdok and Pyatigorsk
to find the cooking oil, coffee, snack food and household goods for
her stall, said the Russian soldiers demand 50 rubles, or about $2,
to walk past a checkpoint and 1000 rubles, or about $38, to pass by
car.
</P>
<P>
   And Arbi said he was still trying to recover two trucks that
were confiscated by soldiers from Russia's 205th Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for sure how long the military occupation will last
and when the two sides will trust each another enough to allow the
local residents to run their own affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his headquarters, a heavily guarded building,
whose windows frames were piled high with sandbags to guard against
drive-by shootings and snipers, Kovrov said the hope was to hold
elections this summer so that his region could pick a new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' he added optimistically, ``this place will be just
like any other in Russia.''

IN POLICY SHIFT, TOP OFFICIAL WANTS DRUG TESTS AND TREATMENT IN
JUSTICE SYSTEM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's top official on drug
policy has proposed a strategy of integrating drug testing and
treatment into virtually every phase of the criminal justice
process, from arrests to incarceration and after release from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, long a proponent of treatment, laid out a detailed case
for his strategy on Tuesday and Wednesday to 900 law-enforcement,
prison and public health specialists who converged from around the
country to discuss how to break the intractable cycle between
substance abuse and crime.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey told them that the present criminal justice system was
a ``disaster'' that has put tens of thousands of drug offenders
behind bars without treating the addictions that had put them
there.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day assembly, which concludes on Thursday, was called
by the White House Office of National Drug Control, the Department
of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to
mobilize support for their belief that drug treatment works, even
when it is forced upon prisoners in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take back what you've learned from this conference,'' Attorney
General Janet Reno told the delegates Wednesday. ``Know you're on
the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Refining an argument that he has been advancing for months,
McCaffrey said that an estimated 50 to 85 percent of the 1.8
million inmates in American prisons and jails were there
fundamentally because of compulsive use of psychoactive drugs or
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey began promoting the need for treatment shortly after
he took the White House post in 1996. Drug treatment programs are
now in 26 of the 42 federal prisons, with others expected to join
later.
</P>
<P>
   A study prepared by the White House drug control office
estimated that drug treatment in prison would add another $3,000 to
the $20,000 or more a year spent to incarcerate an inmate, but that
money would be saved in the long run because treatment would reduce
the number of people returning to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to cost a lot less than we're spending,'' said
McCaffrey, who declined to put a price tag on what the new emphasis
on treatment would cost. To get the money, the administration must
sell its strategy not only to Congress, but also to state and local
politicians and law-enforcement officials, who tend toward greater
skepticism about the value of treatment for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The country's penal system, McCaffrey said, costs taxpayers $38
billion a year, and left unchecked, the prison population will soon
reach two million.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy attempts to reconcile two contradictory views
of drugs and crime. The criminal justice approach has focused on
catching and punishing offenders. The public health approach has
argued for treating the addiction that led the offenders to commit
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't been adversaries but we haven't been allies
either,'' said Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human
Services, whose department takes a public health approach to drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno, the country's top criminal justice official, has
thrown her support behind the new strategy espoused by McCaffrey.
Wednesday, she said that courts could make a tremendous difference
if their caseloads of drug offenders were reduced to manageable
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make courts a beacon of hope rather than a dropping-off
place after everything else has failed,'' she said.

<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. _ An 18-year-old Army private was convicted
Wednesday of fatally bludgeoning a fellow soldier whom he had
harassed for being gay but who feared expulsion from the service if
he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights proponents have said the court-martial here laid bare
the grave flaws in the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old victim, Pfc. Barry Winchell of Kansas City, Mo.,
was beaten to death with a baseball bat as he slept in his barracks
bed early last July 5 after what fellow soldiers testified was
months of vile name-calling, rumor-mongering and an inquiry into
his private life that was supposed to be forbidden under military
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's killer, Pvt. Calvin Glover, 18, of Sulphur, Okla.,
had pleaded guilty to a charge of unpremeditated murder. But
Wednesday he was convicted of premeditated murder, after details of
the final months of Winchell's life as a soldier subjected to
derision and fear were heard at the court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   The court of five officers and enlisted men began deliberating
into the night, solely measuring how calculating Glover had been in
the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that the victim, fearful that protesting the
harassment to superiors meant risking expulsion from the service as
a homosexual, had been taunted by Glover into a fistfight. Winchell
won the fight handily at the end of a night of barracks drinking.
But the humiliated loser, Glover, retaliated with a baseball bat
two days later as Winchell slept, bludgeoning him in premeditated
revenge, the Army charged.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to the lesser charge and hoping for leniency,
Glover accused a second defendant, 25-year-old Specialist Justin
Fisher of Lincoln, Neb., of supplying the baseball bat and goading
him into the assault. ``I was just so drunk,'' Glover tearfully
told the court Monday. ``I had no intent for him to die.''
</P>
<P>
   The court-martial, replete with testimony about widespread
drunkenness and barracks harassment and routine denunciations of
Winchell by fellow soldiers as ``a faggot,'' ``a queer'' and a
``homo,'' was treated by the prosecution as purely a murder trial.
The Army has made no comment on the case's possible implications
for its controversial policy toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   But gay-rights organizations contend that the slaying is a
classic example of a hate crime rooted in homophobia, and that the
Clinton administration's ``don't ask'' policy, far from making life
easier for gays and lesbians in the armed services, has left many
to suffer in silence or leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the policy has seen a doubling of
discharges of gay service members, to 312 last year, and a
comparable increase in complaints of homosexual harassment,
according to pro-gay organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This murder has shut down any illusions soldiers had,'' said
Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, a gay-rights organization that monitors military
justice, in underscoring the Pentagon's failure to circulate
guidelines on its gay policy until after the slaying of Winchell.
``Every day, service members in every service must endure anti-gay
epithets and threats.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In testimony at the trial and in a preliminary inquiry here last
summer, witnesses said that Glover, after being struck in the face
and thrown to the ground in his challenge to Winchell, seethed with
embarrassment, shouted homophobic curses and threatened to kill
him, declaring, ``It ain't over.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Winchell, a machine gunner in the 101st
Airborne Division, had been called a homosexual by his roommate,
Fisher, who is facing a separate court-martial Monday on charges
that he was an accomplice in the slaying and lied to investigators.
Glover's defense team sought to bring out from witnesses that
Fisher was a dominant, manipulative individual while the accused
private was subservient and a braggart.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge, Col. Gary Holland, told the court that the
critical question was whether Glover, amid a long weekend of
barracks drinking, partying, and bickering, had opportunity to
``cool off'' from a point of initial rage and premeditate the
assault. Of Fisher, the judge stressed it had been stipulated as
fact that ``he's the one who handed the accused the bat'' and
``told him to go out and mess up'' Private Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the slaying, a military policeman testified,
Fisher, his clothes covered in blood, stood by the ambulance
shouting, ``Let him die! Let him die!'' as Winchell was taken to
the hospital. In the earlier hearing, Fisher swore that Glover
spewed homophobic epithets before the assault and confessed to the
slaying as he hurriedly washed blood from the bat. When the two
checked on the stricken Winchell, Fisher said, Glover lifted his
bloodied head and said, ``Yes, he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that the assault was so severe that
Winchell's face was unrecognizable, with his eyes swollen shut and
his head cracked open. Glover fled the scene, according to
testimony, and threw bloody evidence in a dumpster. He was later
arrested in his room by investigators who said they found blood
stains on the door and on his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Fisher accompanied Winchell to the Connection in
Nashville, Tenn., a nightclub favored by gays, according to
witnesses, and gossip soon went around the post that the Winchell
was homosexual. Testimony established that Winchell had dated a
female impersonator at the club, Cal Addams, a former Navy medic
known as Calpernia, who eulogized Winchell last July as ``a kind,
calm gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everybody in the company called him derogatory
names,'' Winchell's platoon sergeant, Michael Kleifgen, testified
at the pre-trial hearing. ``They called him a `faggot' and stuff
like that, I would say on a daily basis. A lot of times, he was
walking around down in the dumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the military's ``Don't ask'' stricture, Kleifgen
testified last summer that he decided to informally investigate
after Fisher described the nightclub visit without identifying
Winchell. The sergeant said he suspected that Winchell was gay but
Winchell denied this. The sergeant dropped the matter, he
testified, finally acknowledging to the amazement of some in his
audience, that ``the military has a policy of `Don't ask, don't
tell.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the sergeant said he did nothing to enforce
Army regulations against the sort of harassment that Winchell was
suffering. ``Everybody was having fun,'' the sergeant said in
explaining his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   In the welter of harassment and epithets, several witnesses
testified, a few soldiers complained of homophobic denunciations of
Winchell by ranking superiors. But nothing came of their
complaints, the witnesses said. ``We did a formal IG complaint and
nothing was done, sir,'' Kleifgen testified Wednesday, referring to
the inspector general's office here. The Fort Campbell public
affairs office said it would inquire into the reported complaint to
see what might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy introduced by the Clinton administration, the
military cannot inquire into a soldier's sex life unless there is
clear evidence of homosexual conduct. But gays who volunteer this
information can be discharged for being homosexual. After the
Winchell slaying and reports of white supremacists in the Army,
Clinton signed an executive order in October that amends the court
martial manual to allow judges to weigh hate-crime factors in
meting out sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a service member was killed because of his sexual
orientation was beating death of Alan Schindler, a Navy petty
officer who was assaulted by two shipmates in October 1992, aboard
the USS Belleau Wood.

FIVE CUBAN EXILES ACQUITTED IN PLOT TO KILL CASTRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a defeat for government prosecutors, five Cuban exiles
charged with plotting to kill Fidel Castro at a Caribbean summit
meeting two years ago were acquitted Wednesday of all the charges
against them by a federal jury in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district judge in the case, Hector Laffitte, had
already dismissed conspiracy charges against a sixth defendant for
lack of evidence. A seventh man, who is suffering from cancer, is
to be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the verdicts, after only about seven hours
of deliberations, brought tears from the defendants, the youngest
of whom was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first ever brought in the United States
charging a conspiracy to assassinate Castro. It also raised
questions about the activities of the powerful political group with
which several of the men were affiliated, the Cuban American
National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation, which lobbies on U.S. policy toward Cuba and
other issues, and the accused men insisted that they channeled
their opposition to the Castro government through wholly peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the defendants' intentions emerged as soon as Coast
Guard officers intercepted four of the men on a cabin cruiser off
Puerto Rico in October, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When the authorities discovered two huge .50-caliber sniper
rifles aboard the boat, one of the defendants, Angel Alfonso,
blurted out that the guns were his and that his ``sole mission in
life,'' was to kill the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
   In court, where only part of Alfonso's statement was admitted as
evidence, his lawyer, Ricardo R. Pesquera, said his client was just
bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   Without putting any of the aging defendants on the witness
stand, their attorneys accepted virtually all of the circumstantial
evidence the prosecution put forth: the contradictory statements to
Coast Guard officers; the preparation of the boat, the rifles, and
night-vision goggles; and the renting of a temporary apartment on
Venezuela's Margarita Island, where Castro met with other heads of
state from Latin American, Spain and Portugal in the first days of
November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while the prosecutors argued that the rifles and the
amateurish skullduggery were clearly directed at murdering the
Cuban leader, defense lawyers insisted that the men were peaceful
activists headed for the island to protest against Castro and
perhaps to help spirit away any members of his entourage who might
want to seek asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy, 5-foot sniper rifles, they said, were meant for
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the men had at times been associated with militant
anti-Castro activities, the prosecutors offered virtually no
evidence about the defendants' political backgrounds. At one point,
one of the prosecutors said the government was thinking of
presenting evidence of money transfers linked to violent events in
other countries, but it did not.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants were quick to claim a political
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a message to the U.S. government that you cannot be
so hypocritical,'' Pesquera said. He cautioned that he was not
admitting to any assassination plot but added: ``The United States
government tried on many occasions to kill Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also confounded the expectations of some lawyers
that a jury of Puerto Ricans, whose politics tend to be liberal,
might have trouble finding common cause with militantly anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans. Defense lawyers seemed to have taken care of that
by taking every opportunity they could to compare the Cubans'
battle with Washington to those of nationalistic Puerto Ricans,
including the current furor over a Navy bombing on the Puerto Rican
island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, as the defendants congratulated one another
outside the courtroom, at least two of the jurors hurried over to
embrace them and then joined them for a celebration at a local
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a message to the Cuban community that we are
with them and that they should not give up hope,'' the jury
foreman, Carlos Avila, 27, told reporters.

JURY FINDS CONSPIRACY BEHIND KILLING OF MARTIN LUTHER KING 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By EMILY YELLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ A jury in a civil suit brought by the family of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. decided Wednesday that a
retired Memphis cafe owner was part of a conspiracy in the 1968
killing of King.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's decision means it did not believe that James Earl
Ray, who was convicted of the crime, fired the shot that killed
King.
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks of testimony and one hour of deliberation, the
jury in the wrongful-death case found that Loyd Jowers as well as
``others, including governmental agencies'' were part of a
conspiracy. The jury awarded the King family the damages they had
sought: $100, which the family says it will donate to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The family has long questioned Ray's conviction and hoped the
suit would change the legal and historical record of the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vindication for us,'' said Dexter King, the youngest
son of King. He said he hoped history books would be rewritten to
reflect this version of the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, 73 and in failing health, owned Jim's Grill in 1968, a
restaurant opposite the motel where King was shot and just below
the second-floor rooming house from which, according to James Earl
Ray's confession in 1969, Ray fired the single shot that killed
King. Ray, who recanted his confession, hinted at a conspiracy. He
died in prison last year while serving a 99-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Jowers, in a 1993 television interview, claimed that he had
hired a Memphis police officer to kill King from the bushes behind
his restaurant. Jowers said he was paid to do so by a Memphis
grocery store owner with Mafia connections.
</P>
<P>
   In an unlikely alliance, the King family was represented in the
case by William Pepper, who had been Ray's lawyer. The King family
maintains that Pepper's version of the assassination is the one
that gets at the real truth behind King's death, not the official
version with Ray as the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper maintained that federal, state and Memphis governmental
agencies, as well as the news media, conspired in the
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper said that challenging the accepted version of the killing
was very difficult because, after 31 years, it had become
``implanted neurologically'' on the public's psyche. In his closing
argument Wednesday, he urged the jury to ``send a message to all
those in power that you cannot get away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jowers' lawyer, Lewis Garrison, had said from the beginning of
the trial that he agreed with 80 percent of Pepper's conspiracy
theories and disagreed only on the extent of his client's
involvement. In his closing argument Wednesday, Garrison repeated
what he had said through the trial _ that his client participated
in the conspiracy, but did not know that it was a plot to kill
King.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, David Morphy, said after the trial: ``We all thought
it was a cut and dried case with the evidence that Mr. Pepper
brought to us, that there were a lot of people involved, everyone
from the CIA, military involvement, and Jowers was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, an assistant district attorney in Memphis, who
was not part of the civil proceedings but was part of the criminal
case against Ray, said, ``I'm not surprised by the verdict. This
case overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was
presented, what other option did the jury have but to accept Mr.
Pepper's version?''
</P>
<P>
   And Gerald Posner, whose recent book, ``Killing the Dream'' made
the case that Ray was the killer, said, ``It distresses me greatly
that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical
manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of
their own view of the facts, they got it.''

STATE COURT HALTS GIULIANI PLAN TO MAKE HOMELESS FAMILIES WORK FOR
SHELTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state court Wednesday ordered a temporary halt to
the Giuliani administration's plan to make homeless families work
for shelter, characterizing a measure that would place the children
of people who fail to meet the requirement in foster care as
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that the implementation of this strikes terror in
the hearts of people who have children,'' Justice Elliott Wilk of
state Supreme Court in Manhattan said. He dismissed as ``a
fantasy'' the city lawyers' description of administrative
safeguards for homeless parents who would face expulsion from
shelter and child neglect charges for violating welfare rules.
</P>
<P>
   The city had planned to start enforcing the work-for-shelter
regulations on Monday. The temporary restraining order issued
Wednesday delays implementation of the measures at least until Jan.
14, when a hearing is to be held to determine whether the plan
violates an earlier court ruling that the city cannot seek to place
children whose families lack housing in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   The order came at the end of an unusual emergency hearing
presided over by two judges, Wilk and Justice Helen E. Freedman,
who are both veterans of litigation over homeless families.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman ruled in May 1997 that the city could move ahead with
state shelter regulations, but barred it ``from seeking foster care
solely based upon lack of housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her decision was based in part on a previous ruling by Wilk,
upheld on appeal in 1989, that said such actions would violate the
state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the homeless asked each judge separately for a
temporary restraining order because of their prior rulings, but the
judges agreed to hear the arguments together in Freedman's
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've received tremendous objections from the clergy,
particularly a long letter from Cardinal O'Connor,'' Freedman said
after citing her own concerns that mothers and children would be
harmed by the plan. ``The analogy he made was putting the children
in the manger.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wilk and Freedman set the hearing date for January, Leonard
Koerner, the chief assistant corporation counsel, pressed for a
Dec. 22 date instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you really have to implement this for
Christmas,'' Wilk replied.
</P>
<P>
   The city's plan would immediately affect about 5,000 homeless
families, including 9,000 children, who are now in city-financed
shelters, and any families who apply for shelter, but are
disqualified because of welfare violations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Koerner argued vigorously that the state Supreme Court had no
authority to stop the plan because the appellate division had
rejected some arguments that were made by lawyers for the homeless
during three years of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Koerner, clearly exasperated by the court's decision, told the
judges that the legal maneuver by Steven Banks, a Legal Aid lawyer
who is also counsel to the Coalition for the Homeless, ``is one of
the most outrageous applications I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You and Judge Wilk are powerless to change this,'' he told
Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   Wilk conceded, ``You may be right,'' but added that ``in the
spirit of the season,'' and in order to properly read the case
history and legal briefs, he said he was inclined to grant Banks'
request.

MRS. CLINTON SAYS SHE WILL WORK TO OVERTURN MILITARY'S POLICY ON
GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive) 
 (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton told a group of gay
contributors this week that the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy,
intended to make it easier for homosexuals to serve in the
military, had been a failure, her aides said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, a candidate for the U.S. Senate from New York,
said that if elected she would work to overturn what was one of the
first programs put in place under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, speaking at a fund-raiser in Manhattan on Tuesday
night, said that gays and lesbians should be allowed to serve
openly in the military, according to participants. Acknowledging
that it was politically unrealistic to expect Congress to approve
such legislation now, she said the Pentagon should take steps to
reduce the instances of gays being discharged from the military.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks, made at a private appearance organized
by gay supporters that raised about $100,000 for her campaign, were
related by people who attended and confirmed by her office in a
written statement on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians already serve with distinction in our
nation's armed forces and should not face discrimination,'' Mrs.
Clinton said in the statement. ``Fitness to serve should be based
on an individual's conduct, not their sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement puts Mrs. Clinton, once again, at odds with a
policy implemented by her husband's administration that her aides
believe could cause her problems as a candidate in New York. But it
puts her in line with the views of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her
likely Republican opponent, who aides say also supports allowing
gays to serve in the military and has been critical of the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's comments marked the first time she had publicly
discussed her views about one of the more difficult episodes of
Clinton's first term in office, according to Jeff Soref, the
co-chairman of the Empire State Pride Agenda, a gay rights group,
and an organizer of the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Clinton's attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals
in the military _ an attempt to fulfill a pledge he made as a
presidential candidate in 1992 _ dominated his first months in
office, raising questions about the new president's competence and
ideology, among both supporters and opponents of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton eventually abandoned an executive order, instead
agreeing to legislation that permitted gays and lesbians to serve
in the military providing they did not disclose or act upon their
sexuality, and prohibiting the military from initiating unfounded
inquiries about homosexuality. That approach ended up angering many
of the people Clinton had set out to please in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, responding to a question posed at the fund-raiser
held at the studio of the artist Ross Bleckner , voiced her
displeasure with the policy in unequivocal terms, according to
participants. There were murmurs of approval and soft applause as
she described ``don't ask, don't tell'' as a failure, taking note
of the fact that there has been an increase in the number of gays
expelled from the military since the policy was put in force. Gay
groups say that since the policy was put into effect, the number of
such discharges has doubled, to 312, last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, quite frankly, she expressed a view that is an
emerging consensus among people who are following this closely,''
said Richard Socarides, the former White House liaison to gay
groups, who attended the fund-raiser. Socarides said Mrs. Clinton
stated her views ``directly and forcefully,'' adding: ``I suspect
that if you asked the president directly, he would say that this is
an area that requires a lot of work also.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton have embraced the
same position on an issue that so deeply split Congress in 1993 _
and caused major political problems for the Democratic White House
_ reflects the extent to which both Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton view
gay men and lesbians in New York as a source of both votes and
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have already gone to some lengths
to court support from gay voters, and Mrs. Clinton's advisers said
they are concerned that the mayor might do well among a group of
voters that has historically been viewed as a reliable part of the
Democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser, Mrs. Clinton also voiced support for
domestic partnership measures that would allow gay partners to
receive the same health and other financial benefits as married
couples. On this, her position is similar to the one taken by
Giuliani, who supported a domestic partnership law in 1997. The
mayor frequently remarks that he, rather than any of his Democratic
predecessors, signed the city's first domestic partnership
legislation.

<P>
   The holiday battle to be the leading toy store in cyberspace
shifted last week as Etoys, the Internet startup, pulled ahead of
Toysrus.com, the Web site of the big toy chain, according to the
research company Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Etoys became the fourth most visited commerce site over all,
with an average of 384,000 people visiting the site each day last
week, an increase of 53 percent from the previous week and 72
percent from the most recent three-week average.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com fell to fifth place, with 314,000 daily users, up
2.3 percent from the previous week and 23 percent from the most
recent three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With Internet sales expected to triple this year over last year,
many companies expect the holiday season to help sort the ultimate
winners from the losers online. And the toy market is shaping up as
a typical struggle between well-known retail chains, like Toys
``R'' Us, and fast moving Internet upstarts, like Etoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys `R' Us may be generating traffic by virtue of its brand
name in the real world,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications. ``But when people came to the site, people may not
have found the retail experience they had expected and not have
purchased because of that. Etoys has a better sense of how to
merchandise on an Internet site.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Media Metrix found that eBay, the auction site, was
the most visited site, as in the previous week, followed by
Amazon.com. Buy.com, a discounter of computers and other goods,
jumped into third position from seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Mypoint.com, Vvitaminshoppe.com, and eGreetings.com all dropped
off the Top 10 ten list from two weeks ago to last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Metrix ratings are one of the best publicly available
windows into holiday buying trends on the Internet, but they have
significant limits. Using a method similar to the Nielsen ratings
for television, Media Metrix monitors the Web surfing behavior of
15,000 computer users in the United States. Still, some Internet
companies complain that Media Metrix's ratings underestimate their
own user count, and most likely underrepresent users in offices and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Media Metrix measures the number of people who
view sites, not those who actually buy from them. And sites vary
widely in how well they persuade visitors to become paying
customers.
</P>
<P>
   That difference can be seen in one measure of actual buying
behavior, an index by NextCard, an issuer of MasterCard and Visa
credit cards, of the online sites where its 140,000 cardholders
make purchases. In November, a period in which Media Metrix says
Toysrus.com had more visitors than Etoys, Toysrus.com was not among
the top 25 sites patronized by NextCard customers, while Etoys
ranked No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly eBay, ranked No. 1 by Media Metrix, was ranked 13th by
Next Card, indicating that eBay attracts a large audience of people
who regularly look at and bid at auctions, but that the number of
actual purchases is far less.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Media Metrix nor NextCard can determine how well
Amazon.com is doing at selling merchandise other than books. Amazon
is spending a considerable portion of its marketing budget to
promote its toy department, for example. But Amazon continues to
increase its lead in NextCard's tally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon has really pulled away from the pack,'' said Jamie
Hale, the director of new product development for NextCard. He said
that Amazon now represents nearly 40 percent of all online
transactions by Next Card holders.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Toysrus.com has slowed down, three of the four sites
that have gained the most visitors recently, according to Media
Metrix, were linked to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.
KBKids.com, affiliated with KB Toys, the No. 2 chain, increased its
visitors by 132 percent. KB is spending $40 million to advertise
its web site this holiday season. Both Sears.com and Wal-Mart.com
more than doubled their traffic over the previous three weeks.

ISRAEL, SYRIA TO RESUME TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a dramatic breakthrough in the Middle East peace
process, Israel and Syria agreed Wednesday to resume negotiations
that had been suspended for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced the development, saying that talks
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa would be held in Washington next week and
that they would begin at ``the point where they left off'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``These negotiations will be high-level, comprehensive, and
conducted with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Clinton said. ``Peace has long been within our sight.
Today, it is within our grasp, and we must seize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a nationally televised news conference from the
State Department, Clinton added, ``There can be no illusion here.
On all tracks the road ahead will be arduous. . . . They face hard
choices. They will have to stand firmly against all those who seek
to derail the peace, and sadly there are too many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Israel suspended negotiations 3 1/2 years ago amid a
wave of terrorist attacks against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement after Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright, who is touring the Middle East and who met with Syrian
President Hafez Assad on Tuesday, brought Barak a clarification of
Syria's position.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after that briefing, Barak said, ``There
clearly is a unique opportunity. We have so many other things to do
than to be deployed for another generation or two along the border
and bury our youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, meanwhile, quoted a senior US official as
saying that Syria had made key concessions that allowed the
resumption of direct talks.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had held a tough bargaining position insisting that he
would not restart negotiations unless Israel picked up where he
says the two sides left off under the government of slain Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Assad said that Rabin had promised that Israel would return to
the borders of June 4, 1967, before it captured the strategic Golan
Heights in the Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Israel denied having made such a promise.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the US official said, Damascus agreed that the
talks could resume without conditions. While Syria was not dropping
its demand for the Golan, it was no longer insisting the talks open
with the assumption of a full Israeli pullback, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another Syrian concession, the official said, was its agreement
to have Sharaa head its delegation. Talks with Israel in the past
have involved lower-ranking diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Eyal Zisser, a Tel Aviv University professor who has written
extensively on Syria, said, ``This is a very dramatic development.
We have not had talks with Syria for three years and we have never
had talks on such a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisser said, however, that Clinton's assertion that the talks
will begin ``where they left off'' in 1996 could indicate that
Assad received key assurances that heightened his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And Zisser cautioned, ``If the Syrians come with an assumption
that they will get what they want and then they realize this is not
what Barak had in mind, it could become a problem quickly and end
in a fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough comes at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli
track had been bogged down over the issue of Jewish settlement
expansion and over which 5 percent of West Bank land Israel should
turn over to the Palestinians next. The land was to have been
handed over a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Albright announced late Wedneday night, however, after meeting
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Ramallah, that he had
agreed to resume negotiations with Israel and pledged a ``good
faith'' effort to find a way to settle the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, meanwhile, called the announcement of renewed
Israeli-Syrian talks good news for the Palestinian people and Arab
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that peace moves on all tracks, especially the
Syrian and the Lebanese tracks, and I wish these negotiations
success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Clinton would not devote energy to helping Israel
and Syria make peace at the expense of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully understand that the Palestinian issues are at the
core of a comprehensive settlement,'' Albright said. ``One track is
not being favored over another and actions will not be taken with
one at the expense of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Syrian-Israeli talks lead to an agreement, that could
pave the way for Israel to reach a settlement with its northern
neighbor Lebanon, where 30,000 Syrian troops are deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Lebanon, where Israel occupies a roughly 9-mile wide
swath of territory it calls its ``security zone,'' is the last
active war front in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In an almost daily spiral of recriminations, Israeli troops have
been mired in a war against guerrillas from the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, which opposes the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's central campaign promises when he was elected
five months ago was to bring Israeli soldiers home from Lebanon
within one year.
</P>
<P>
   But to accomplish that, it has always been clear that a deal
with Syria had to be reached first.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Israeli-Syrian dispute is the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   A return to the pre-1967 war borders would mean Syria would
regain control of the northern bank of the Sea of Galilee and other
valuable water assets in the region that are now under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Barak's office released a statement aired on
Israeli Television stating that Israel would not agree to withdraw
to the 1967 borders but ``at the same time it expressed willingness
for a territorial compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli left generally accepts the giveback of the Golan as
the only way to achieve peace with Syria and end the bloody
conflict in Lebanon. The Israeli right sees any giveback of the
strategic Golan as a fatal security risk. Barak will have to
delicately balance the two political sides as he tries to bring his
coalition government along the path to peace without alienating
either side in a way that could disintegrate his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Bar-Lev, a spokesman for the Golan Residents Committee,
said, ``We are shocked. Barak promised us that he would speak to us
before resuming the talks and instead we are left to find out about
it on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If these talks are to `pick up where they left off,' as
Clinton described it, it would mean full withdrawal. This would
mean the end of all we have invested here, the end of security for
Israel, for its water needs,'' Bar-Lev added. ``This is a disaster.
We will do everything necessary to be sure it doesn't happen.''

 HORMONE SEEN AS AUTISM CURE IS UNDER FIRE IN NEW STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hormone trumpeted in the news media and on the Internet as a
potential cure for autism worked no better than saltwater in its
first controlled clinical trial, scientists are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The study, described in the issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine that is being published Thursday, is one of a dozen
efforts sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to test the
hormone, secretin, which gained wide attention after a 3-year-old
New Hampshire boy showed rapid improvement after taking the drug in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretin is in widespread use across the country,'' said Dr.
Marie Bristol-Power, special assistant for autism programs at the
Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the NIH.
``Parents need to know if it is promising and should be pursued or
if they are being taken advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was not definitive, Dr. Bristol-Power said, and
researchers will know more by the middle of next year, when other
studies are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of secretin were quick to denounce the new study,
saying it did not give the drug a fair test.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever claimed that secretin is a miracle cure for
autism,'' said Victoria Beck, the mother of the boy who improved
after taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beck, who has written a book on secretin, called the hormone
``a clue that deserves careful investigation, and not dismissal
from autism gurus, who have a vested interest in the way things
have been done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Autism is a serious brain disorder that begins in infancy and
prevents children from developing normally. Symptoms, which can be
mild to severe, include an inability to communicate, a refusal to
make eye contact, repetitive behavior like head banging or hand
flapping, and a preoccupation with unusual activities or interests.
Half a million Americans have the disorder, which is typically
treated with educational and behavioral therapy. While intensive
therapy has proved effective in some patients, two-thirds of adults
with autism cannot live independently.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin is a hormone made in the intestine that stimulates the
release of digestive fluids. Ms. Beck's son, Parker, was given an
injection to explore the cause of his chronic diarrhea. Soon
afterward, his behavior improved; he could hold still and interact
better with adults.
</P>
<P>
   When his story was reported on television, in newspapers and on
the Internet last year, parents began clamoring to get the drug.
Dr. Bristol-Power said that the supply of secretin was soon
exhausted and that a black market developed involving sham
secretin, price gouging and other forms of profiteering; Ms. Beck
said that these stories were exaggerated and that no one today had
any problem obtaining secretin at a fair price, which is about $200
an injection.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotes about secretin are thriving on the Internet. Some
parents report dramatic effects, others see no effect and some
report that their child's symptoms have worsened. Both sides in the
secretin controversy estimate that 2,000 to 3,000 children have
taken or are taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The controlled study of secretin was led by Dr. James Bodfish of
the Western Carolina Center and the University of North Carolina,
and by Dr. Adrian Sandler of the Center for Child Development at
Thoms Rehabilitation Hospital in Asheville, N.C. In all, 56
autistic children 3 to 14 years of age took part in the study. Half
received a single injection of synthetic human secretin, and the
rest were injected with saltwater. Researchers administered a
battery of behavioral tests at intervals of one day, one week and
four weeks after the treatment. Statistically, the two groups
showed no differences, Sandler said.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the children in both the placebo and treatment groups
improved on some of the same measures. The only explanation,
Sandler said, is a ``significant placebo effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are extremely invested in the possibility of new
treatments and have high expectancies,'' he said. ``They are
looking for subtle improvements. Kids with autism show variability
in their day-to-day behavior, and it would be easy to attribute
normal variations to the secretin.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beck disputes this interpretation, contending that by
concentrating on standard behavioral tests the researchers have
failed to look at a wide range of physiological responses seen in
children given secretin, and that those should be studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really bothers me that parents are portrayed as this
desperate group of people with vacant minds,'' she said. ``They
claim we can't tell the difference between an improvement and a
mirage. But when a child stops vomiting, sleeps through the night
and makes eye contact, we know something is happening.''

EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE V-CHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHAT IS THE V-CHIP?
</P>
<P>
   The v-chip is used to filter programming as it comes into your
TV set. It's an electronic chip that works with your television,
cable box, VCR or its own retrofit device to block shows that
parents may feel are inappropriate for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ages of 3 and 12, the average child will see 8,000
killings and 100,000 violent acts on television, according to a
study by the National Association for Family and Community
Education. Many parents want to block programs with a lot of
violence and sex.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the v-chip comes in. The ``v'' stands for
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8, 1996, President Clinton signed into law the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which included a section
authorizing the v-chip. Section 551 is called ``Parental Choice in
Television Programming.'' It gave broadcasters the chance to
voluntarily create a television ratings system and broadcast
signals containing those ratings. The ratings don't apply to news
and sports.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DOES IT WORK?
</P>
<P>
   The chip intercepts the ratings signal transmitted by
broadcasters, and passes it to your television. The program will be
denied access to your television if it exceeds a ratings limit set
by the television's owner _ that means parents.
</P>
<P>
   WHO DESIGNED THE V-CHIP?
</P>
<P>
   John Olivo, an electrical engineer, created the v-chip to help
parents stop kids from calling adult telephone hot lines. He
applied for a patent in 1987, and received patent approval in 1989.
Shortly afterward, he adapted his invention for use in VCRs, and
later for television. Olivo's patent was licensed by Parental
Guide, an Omaha, Neb., company that develops screening devices. The
company is now marketing the v-chip.
</P>
<P>
   DO ALL TELEVISIONS HAVE ONE?
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, but most of them will soon. The Federal Communications
Commission mandated that all TV sets 13 inches or larger
manufactured after Jan. 1, 2000, have v-chips installed. For older
TVs, a stand-alone retrofit device is available.
</P>
<P>
   HOW DO THE RATINGS WORK?
</P>
<P>
   The TV ratings system, also known as TV Parental Guidelines, was
created by the National Association of Broadcasters, the National
Cable Television Association and the Motion Picture Association of
America. You see these ratings in the top left corner of your TV
screen during the first 15 seconds of rated programming. Shows that
are longer than one hour have the ratings displayed for 15 seconds
at the start of each hour.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IT RATED?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick guide to TV parental guidelines
</P>
<P>
   TV-Y, ``All children''
</P>
<P>
   This programming is appropriate for all children. It's designed
specifically for very young children and shouldn't frighten them.
</P>
<P>
   TV-Y7, ``Directed to older children''
</P>
<P>
   Programs with this rating are designed for children 7 and older.
Fantasy and comedic violence may be included.
</P>
<P>
   TV-G, ``General audience''
</P>
<P>
   This rating doesn't mean the program is designed for all ages,
although many parents may feel comfortable letting young children
watch it unattended. The program has little or no violence, few or
no sexual situations and no strong language.
</P>
<P>
   TV-PG, ``Parental guidance suggested''
</P>
<P>
   Parents may want to watch these programs with their kids.
Material unsuitable for younger children is presented.
</P>
<P>
   TV-14, ``Parents strongly cautioned''
</P>
<P>
   Parents are encouraged to monitor viewing of this program, as it
contains material unsuitable for children younger than 14 to view
alone. It may contain sexual content, violence and strong language.
</P>
<P>
   TV-MA, ``Mature audience only''

BULGER ALLY EXPECTED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO RACKETEERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reputed New England Mafia Boss Francis ``Cadillac
Frank'' Salemme is poised to plead guilty Thursday to a federal
racketeering indictment that alleges he killed four men and plotted
with South Boston crime boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger to control the
region's illegal rackets, according to sources familiar with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   If US District Judge Mark L. Wolf accepts Salemme's plea, the
66-year-old don, who has been jailed without bail since August
1995, could be a free man in 6 1/2 years under an agreement with
federal prosecutors, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement calls for a sentence ranging from 10 years
and 10 months to 13 1/2 years, but Salemme will be credited with
the time he has been jailed while awaiting trial in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike confessed Mafia hitman John Martorano, who has been
granted leniency in exchange for his cooperation against Bulger,
who is a fugitive, and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, Salemme has
not agreed to cooperate with investigators, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern's office declined to comment
Wednesday on Salemme's scheduled change of plea; lawyers Anthony
Cardinale and John Mitchell, who represent Salemme, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for federal prosecutors to negotiate plea
agreements without getting cooperation from defendants in
complicated racketeering cases that would involve lengthy trials.
This case is even more complex than most because of revelations
that Salemme's codefendants, Bulger and Flemmi, were FBI
informants.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Salemme could cause a shift in strategy by
prosecutors who brought the indictment five years ago and are not
even close to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme's plea will leave only Flemmi, Bulger, and reputed
mobster Robert DeLuca in the case. But it appears DeLuca may not be
in the case for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Randy Gioia, who represents DeLuca, said Wednesday,
``Bob DeLuca has absolutely no desire to remain in a case where his
only codefendants are government informants, the functional
equivalent of FBI agents. And he has absolutely no connection to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   If Flemmi and Bulger become the only defendants remaining in the
case, prosecutors could decide to drop the racketeering indictment
and file new charges against the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Salemme's lawyers had planned to argue that he should
be released on bail as there is still no trial date set in the case
that has dragged on for five years in the wake of the disclosure
that Bulger and Flemmi were longtime FBI informants.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Salemme to plead guilty comes a few months after
he lost a bid to get the landmark racketeering case dismissed on
the grounds that Bulger and Flemmi were working for the FBI and
therefore could not also have been genuine members of a
racketeering enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Wolf held lengthy hearings and listened to a parade
of witnesses who exposed a cozy relationship between Bulger and
Flemmi and their FBI handlers. One former FBI supervisor confessed
that he pocketed $7,000 in bribes from the informants and routinely
tipped them to cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a 661-page decision in September, Wolf refused to dismiss the
racketeering case or toss out a key piece of evidence: FBI tapes of
a 1989 Mafia induction ceremony in Medford that was attended by
mobsters from around New England.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf rejected Flemmi's claim that the FBI had promised him and
Bulger immunity from prosecution. Still, Flemmi enjoyed a partial
victory as Wolf ruled that prosecutors are barred from using any
evidence agains Flemmi that was gleaned directly or indirectly from
him while he was an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's office is waiting for approval from the solicitor
general to appeal Wolf's ruling. Meanwhile, more hearings are
expected in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering indictment alleges that Salemme, who reputedly
assumed control of the Patriarca crime family in 1991, and Bulger
divided up illegal rackets through New England, controlling
bookmaking and loansharking, and shaking down drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme is charged with killing four men during the 1960s gang
wars, but earlier Wolf warned that he might dismiss the
racketeering acts involving murder because they were added late in
the case and might have involved a misuse of the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims include three brothers, Edward, Walter, and
William Bennett, and another man, Richard Grasso, who were all
killed in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme spent 15 years in prison for trying to kill a lawyer in
1968 by blowing up his car. The attorney, John E. Fitzgerald, whose
leg was blown off, represented mob-hitman-turned-informant Joseph
``Baron'' Barboza. Flemmi was initially charged in the attack, but
the charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from prison in 1988, Salemme became a ``made''
member of the Mafia and quickly rose through the ranks.

NORTEL IS SAID TO BE SEEKING TO BUY QTERA CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive.)  
(th) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidding to stay on top of the fast-changing optical
communications market, Nortel Networks Corp. is nearing a deal to
acquire Qtera Corp. for $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in stock,
executives close to the talks said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said a deal could be announced within a week but
cautioned that the negotiations could still fall apart. One person
close to the talks said there was an 85 percent chance that the two
companies would complete a deal. Another person close to the
negotiations estimated that chance at 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman at Nortel, which is based in the Toronto suburb of
Brampton, Ontario, and Qtera, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla.,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera, which is underwritten by venture capitalists, is among a
group of young, little-known companies that are developing the next
generation of optical communications technology.
</P>
<P>
   Along with deregulation and the rise of the Internet, the quick
pace of optical development has been a main factor in the
communications revolution, allowing glass fibers thinner than a
human hair to carry billions of bits of digital information each
second.
</P>
<P>
   Big communications equipment companies like Nortel and Lucent
Technologies, the former equipment unit of AT&AMP;T, spend billions
each year on research and development. But because there are so
many technologies to pursue, the big players often find themselves
acquiring start-up companies that have focused on niche areas that
end up becoming important.
</P>
<P>
   Qtera is developing technology that allows fiber optic lines to
carry signals farther than they usually do now without
regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, optic signals that are carrying billions of bits a
second must now be regenerated every 250 to 375 miles, analysts
said. When the optical signals are regenerated, they are usually
converted into electrical signals, then amplified and reconverted
into pulses of light. The need for such regeneration adds cost and
complexity to the construction and operation of continent-spanning
fiber optic networks. Such networks are being built worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other companies like Corvis Corp., Qtera is
developing a system meant to allow signals to travel as far as
2,000 miles without such regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can kill electrical regeneration, you eliminate a huge
cost element; it's a huge cost advantage,'' Sender Cohen, an
analyst for Lehman Brothers, said Wednesday. ``Qtera has the right
solution to carry very high bandwidth traffic over very long
distances cost effectively, more cost effectively than just about
anything on the market today. The only other company that has a
comparable solution is Corvis.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Qtera and Corvis, which is based in Columbia, Md., have
tested their systems with Qwest Communications International Inc.,
the upstart long-distance communications carrier that has agreed to
acquire US West Inc., the regional Bell company. Qwest also happens
to use a lot of Nortel's optical transmission gear.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel is considered the world leader in equipment that can
transmit 10 billion digital bits a second on a single optical
fiber. It would appear logical that Nortel would want to maintain
its optical leadership by integrating Qtera's technology into its
optical communications products.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts wondered Wednesday whether Nortel's pursuit of
Qtera bespoke a Nortel weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that grabs me is why is Nortel Networks making this
investment in a space that you would think they would own,'' said
Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects, a
networking analysis and consulting firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the prominence of Cisco Systems in the market for
Internet switches and of Lucent in the market for traditional phone
systems, Dzubeck added: ``It's like Cisco making an investment in a
routing company. It's like Lucent making an investment in a
telephone switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Qtera has yet to ship its product in significant quantities, but
the communications equipment market has become so heated that a $3
billion valuation would not appear unreasonable, analysts said.

LET'S HOPE `NASTRADAMUS' FORETELLS FUTURE OF HIP-HOP

   If there's one thing there's not a shortage of this holiday
season, it's hip-hop releases. What there is a shortage of, though,
is good hip-hop releases. And when we say good, we don't mean rap's
same ol', same ol', which is: discs filled with gunfire,
woman-bashing, I'm-so-great-bow-before-me posing,
ya-better-buy-my-records threats and endless tales of how fine the
high-life is and how horrible it must be to live without stacks of
money, garages full of limos and an endless posse of girls, girls,
girls. That stuff got old about, oh, five years ago. So it's
incredibly refreshing when a hip-hop artist refuses to go with such
a shallow flow, and for the past few years, Long Island rapper Nas
(mom calls him Nasir Jones) has done just that, crafting records
with down-to-earth lyrics and strong, memorable melodies. And,
unlike Will Smith, Puff Daddy and other top-drawer hip-hop stars,
Nas doesn't rely solely on samples, although he does his share of
pop-catalog pilfering. Yet for the most part, Nas is somewhat of a
hip-hop outsider, which, thankfully, he proves once again on
``Nastradamus,'' his second effort this year (back in April, he
released the equally good ``I Am ...''). Here you will find very
little posing, very little misogyny and very few samples _ you just
get a lot of great hip-hop. In Nas' case, this means you get
stories about looking at life through the broken window of an
apartment in the projects. You see your friends die (''Shoot 'Em
Up''), grow up and move on (''Some of Us Have Angels'') or stay
behind (''Life We Chose''). Never once does Nas bash or condone
gang life (although he does attack drug use); he simply raps about
the chaos swirling around him; he's not pro- or anti-anything, just
an observer. And the mellow-voiced singer wraps these observations
around different styles of music, from the soulful balladry of
``Project Windows'' (that's Ron Isley singing backup) to the
jazz-tinged ``Life We Chose,'' which stylishly samples Maceo
Parker's ``Peace Fugue.'' In between, there are nods to pop and
rock, making ``Nastradamus'' an overwhelmingly eclectic listen _
and an intelligent one, as well. (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

   (NYT22) UNDATED -- Dec. 8, 1999 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT -- No matter
how careful people are, they are bound to scratch furniture. Most
of these mishaps are minor and can easily be erased or hidden
before they become eyesores. Furniture also picks up dirt and dust
that slowly works its way into the waxed surface. Over time, this
grime will dull the sheen of any finish and obscure the beauty of
the wood grain. Fortunately, its simple and inexpensive to solve
these problems. (Edward R. Lipinski/The New York Times)

scientists are attracted to biotechnology because they are judged
solely by their work, rather than office politics or other

LET'S HOPE `NASTRADAMUS' FORETELLS FUTURE OF HIP-HOP

   If there's one thing there's not a shortage of this holiday
season, it's hip-hop releases. What there is a shortage of, though,
is good hip-hop releases. And when we say good, we don't mean rap's
same ol', same ol', which is: discs filled with gunfire,
woman-bashing, I'm-so-great-bow-before-me posing,
ya-better-buy-my-records threats and endless tales of how fine the
high-life is and how horrible it must be to live without stacks of
money, garages full of limos and an endless posse of girls, girls,
girls. That stuff got old about, oh, five years ago. So it's
incredibly refreshing when a hip-hop artist refuses to go with such
a shallow flow, and for the past few years, Long Island rapper Nas
(mom calls him Nasir Jones) has done just that, crafting records
with down-to-earth lyrics and strong, memorable melodies. And,
unlike Will Smith, Puff Daddy and other top-drawer hip-hop stars,
Nas doesn't rely solely on samples, although he does his share of
pop-catalog pilfering. Yet for the most part, Nas is somewhat of a
hip-hop outsider, which, thankfully, he proves once again on
``Nastradamus,'' his second effort this year (back in April, he
released the equally good ``I Am ...''). Here you will find very
little posing, very little misogyny and very few samples _ you just
get a lot of great hip-hop. In Nas' case, this means you get
stories about looking at life through the broken window of an
apartment in the projects. You see your friends die (''Shoot 'Em
Up''), grow up and move on (''Some of Us Have Angels'') or stay
behind (''Life We Chose''). Never once does Nas bash or condone
gang life (although he does attack drug use); he simply raps about
the chaos swirling around him; he's not pro- or anti-anything, just
an observer. And the mellow-voiced singer wraps these observations
around different styles of music, from the soulful balladry of
``Project Windows'' (that's Ron Isley singing backup) to the
jazz-tinged ``Life We Chose,'' which stylishly samples Maceo
Parker's ``Peace Fugue.'' In between, there are nods to pop and
rock, making ``Nastradamus'' an overwhelmingly eclectic listen _
and an intelligent one, as well. (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced on Wednesday that
Israel and Syria would begin top-level peace talks here next week
after a nearly four-year suspension. He said both sides wanted to
reach an agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met with the Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, in Damascus on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The final details were arranged in telephone calls on Wednesday
morning from President Clinton to Assad, who agreed to send Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Shara to Washington, and to Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, who will be the chief Israeli negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``These negotiations will be high-level, comprehensive and
conducted with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as
possible,'' Clinton told a news conference on Wednesday afternoon.
He called the decision to start negotiations ``a significant
breakthrough, for it will allow them to deal with each other face
to face, and that is the only way to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said there was no guarantee the talks would
succeed, but he said the talks left open the goal laid out by Barak
a few months ago: to seek a comprehensive peace settlement
embracing Israel, the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon by next
September.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the negotiations is the question of the return
to Syria of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized during the 1967
war and which it has considered important to its security.
</P>
<P>
   One barrier to resuming the talks, which broke off in early
1996, has been an argument over what both sides had agreed to when
the talks stopped.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, as the administration has tried to
find a formula to reopen talks, Assad has insisted that Israel
agreed four years ago to withdraw to the June 4, 1967, border. But
the Israelis have said the talks ended inconclusively on this
point.
</P>
<P>
   The president said on Wednesday that both sides had agreed to
resume negotiations ``from the point where they left off,'' but
Clinton did not specify what that point was. His phrasing appeared
to offer a way for both sides to save face, and he declined to
elaborate on the terms for resumption of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, said in an
interview after Clinton's statement that ``everything'' would be on
the table next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``All issues will be on the table _ borders, security and the
nature of the peace,'' Berger said. ``These are the issues that
will be determined in the negotiations.'' Even though Assad was
sending his foreign minister, Assad ``will be the chief decision
maker,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of talk at lots of levels,'' Berger said.
``Now we've got Barak and the foreign minister on behalf of
Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Wednesday was the culmination of a series of
phone calls by Clinton _ 31 in all to Barak and Assad since August
_ and a letter from the president to Assad three weeks ago, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, Clinton gave a ``very strong argument that now's
the moment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Assad told Albright on Tuesday that he was prepared to respond
favorably to the letter and start talks where they had left off.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Barak on Wednesday morning and told him of
Assad's willingness to talk, Berger said. The Israeli suggested the
two sides start ``as soon as possible,'' an idea Clinton relayed to
Assad. With the Syrian president's agreement to a prompt start,
Clinton called Barak back to iron out more details, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the new talks represents a fulfillment of a
pledge made by Barak soon after he came into office: that he would
take on what his predecessors had refused to do and conduct talks
with the Palestinians and Syrians on two tracks, but
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most Israeli leaders seem to have felt that their public was not
prepared to absorb two big undertakings that would involve hard
compromises _ one to determine the shape of a Palestinian entity,
which will involve negotiations on giving up areas of the West
Bank; the other on an accord with Syria that will mean talks on
relinquishing the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the basics of the new Israeli-Syrian talks were defined
by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who shuttled more
than 20 times between Israel and Damascus until the talks collapsed
in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the coming negotiations will focus on the
conditions under which Israel would relinquish control of the Golan
Heights. These include the extent and timing of the Israeli
withdrawal, the size of demilitarized zones on either side of the
boundary, an early-warning station for Israel atop Mount Hermon,
which dominates the border, and the makeup of an international
observer force.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis also want ``normalization'' of relations with
Syria, including a halt to Syria's support of terrorist groups, an
opening of Syria's border and an end to the Syrian dogma that
Israel is the enemy.

</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, Assad has told militant Palestinian
groups based in Damascus to end their ``armed struggle'' and
transform themselves into political organizations. Syria remains on
the State Department's list of nations that it says support
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   These moves were interpreted as an effort by Assad to establish
his seriousness about wanting to start talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak come to office, he indicated that he would be willing
to deal on the Golan Heights. President Assad welcomed the new
overture and indicated that he was interested, but in the last few
months his sentiments appeared to have cooled. But Assad is said to
be ailing and may want to seal a deal before handing power to a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to prepare the Israeli public for the possibility
of a deal, Barak said on Israeli television in October that
negotiations would entail ``painful territorial compromises,''
which would particularly affect the thousands of settlers who now
populate the regions.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Clinton said he hoped the resumption of
talks with Syria would lead to talks between Israel and Lebanon.
Barak has said he wants to live up to another campaign pledge: to
withdraw Israeli forces from Lebanon by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Assad called the Lebanese president, Emile Lahud, late on
Wednesday to urge him to start discussions, according to reports
from the region.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, administration officials said they were
surprised, even taken aback, by the outcome of Assad's meeting with
Albright. As an indication of how unprepared some in the
administration were, Albright is scheduled to be in Panama and in
Europe next week, when Barak and Shara are due here.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would most likely meet with the Israeli
leader and the Syrian foreign minister before the talks. The two
would probably then meet with the secretary of state, if she is
here, or Dennis Ross, the administration's chief Middle East
negotiator, he added.
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference, Clinton also defended his policy
toward Russia. He reiterated that the Russians would pay a ``heavy
price'' internationally for the way they are attacking Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also repeated that he was against cutting American aid
to Russia, which now goes to two areas: safeguarding nuclear
weapons and supporting nongovernmental projects intended to promote
democracy. ``I haven't decided what else I can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``I do think, first of all, they may believe that
because of their position in the United Nations and because no one
wants them to fail and have more problems than they've got, that
they can do this. But you know, most of life's greatest wounds for
individuals and for countries are self-inflicted; they're not
inflicted by other people.''

 TEXAS FLIES MURDERER FROM INTENSIVE CARE TO EXECUTION CHAMBER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With several high-profile death penalty cases in Texas
in coming weeks, the execution of a convicted murderer, David
Martin Long, was not expected to generate much fanfare. He had been
scheduled to die by lethal injection Wednesday evening, making him
the 32nd person executed in Texas this year.
</P>
<P>
   But when death row guards found him unconscious from a drug
overdose on Monday morning, Long himself became a high-profile
case. Placed in intensive care on a ventilator in a Galveston
hospital, Long suddenly presented a politically delicate question
for Gov. George W. Bush, even as he campaigned for the Republican
presidential nomination in New Hampshire:
</P>
<P>
   Would the state of Texas remove an inmate from intensive care so
that he could meet his date with the executioner rather than stay
the execution for 30 days? The answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court's rejection Wednesday of Long's final
petition for a delay, Texas officials Wednesday evening to
transported him to the death chamber in Huntsville for execution.
Because Long's doctor deemed such a move ``risky,'' state officials
apparently used an airplane staffed by medical personnel to ensure
that he arrived in good health after the 25-minute trip. With Bush
out of state, the decision on Long's fate Wednesday night
technically fell to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, but Bush's spokeswoman
said the governor agreed the execution should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch advocate of the death penalty in a state that strongly
shares the same view, Bush has made no pretense of extending his
campaign theme of compassionate conservatism to death row. But the
Long case and other upcoming cases might present politically
ticklish moments for Bush as death penalty opponents try to paint a
grim picture of the system in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday for example, the state is scheduled to execute
another convicted murderer, James L. Beathard, whose accuser has
recanted and whose original lawyer now admits he had a conflict of
interest. In January, three inmates who committed homicides as
juveniles are scheduled to die. That same month, Johnny Penry, a
convicted murderer who is considered mentally retarded, is
scheduled for lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases challenge our assumption of the death penalty as
fairly and justly administered,'' said Maurie Levin, executive
director of the Texas Capital Defense Project, a nonprofit group
that helps death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, which leads the nation with 195 executions since 1982,
public support for the death penalty is very high, and Bush's
Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, also was a strong advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The Long case, however, has presented very unusual
circumstances. Convicted of the 1986 hatchet slayings of three
women, one of whom was blind, Long ingested an overdose of
anti-psychotic drugs on Monday morning. Doctors in Galveston placed
him on life support and found themselves in the odd situation of
trying to restore to good health a man with only two days left to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander Duarte, the physician in charge of the case, said
Long, 46, was removed from the ventilator on Tuesday, and by
Wednesday his condition had improved to serious from critical.
Duarte said Long still required oxygen and continual medical care.
Under normal circumstances, he said, he would likely keep Long in
the intensive-care unit for another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Duarte said state officials asked him to sign an
affidavit stating that Long could be safely transported to
Huntsville, a request he said he refused. But Duarte said he signed
an affidavit that stated Long's health had improved, that he had
suffered no seizures and was responding to questioning _ but that
transporting him could be risky without appropriate medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Long's lawyers argued before a state court judge Wednesday
afternoon that their client was no longer competent enough to be
executed. Lawyers for the state Attorney General John Cornyn argued
the opposite, and Judge Edwin V. King agreed.
</P>
<P>
   With that, and rejections by the Supreme Court (a 6-3 vote) and
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (a 4-3 vote) Long's appeals
were all but exhausted. Earlier in the week, the state Board of
Pardons and Parole had rejected his clemency application. So his
last chance was the governor. With Bush in New Hampshire, Perry
rejected Long's request for a 30-day stay of execution. Under Texas
law, when the board rejects clemency, the governor has two options:
reject clemency or grant a 30-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just delay the execution 30 days?
</P>
<P>
   `` Long has been convicted of three murders,'' Sullivan said.
``The Texas Department of Criminal Justice determined that
transporting him from Galveston to Huntsville is not life
threatening. He has received his court appeals, and barring any
additional court actions, we expect the execution to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Long's lawyers, John Blume disagreed. ``It seems like a
pretty sick process when you jerk a guy out of intensive care on a
ventilator,'' he said, adding, ``What's the huge rush?''

TEXAS LAWS ON FIREARMS MISS MARK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Despite Gov. George W. Bush's vow to crack down
on gun-law violators, state officials sat on information that
several hundred convicted felons in Texas may have broken state and
federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Public Safety obtained the information
over the past four years while screening applicants for concealed
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Although felons were denied handgun permits, they could have
broken the law merely by getting gun-safety training at a firing
range. Federal law prohibits felons, even those who have completed
prison sentences or parole, from possessing firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS didn't refer their cases to federal officials for
possible prosecution. Many, perhaps most, applicants train with
their own guns, a spot check of firing ranges indicates.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency didn't refer any cases to state prosecutors,
either. A less strict state law also restricts gun possession by
felons.
</P>
<P>
   In considering handgun permits, the DPS conducts a criminal
background check only after an applicant has taken the firearms
training and submitted a complete application, including criminal
history and fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Butts, a gun-control lobbyist who uncovered the felons'
applications through an open-records request to the DPS, said she
was surprised that the records weren't referred to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked at the hypocrisy of claiming to support
enforcement of existing gun laws as a solution to gun violence,
while ignoring hundreds of felons in Texas, presumably in
possession of guns illegally, who have essentially turned
themselves in to the state,'' Butts said.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, 1996, when the state started issuing handgun
licenses, through this past Aug. 31, the DPS denied 2,658
applications and approved 196,624 others. Felony convictions were
given as the reason for denying more than 600 of the unsuccessful
applications, according to records released by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 100 other cases, felony charges were cited without
clarifying whether there had been a conviction. But the DPS may
have concluded that those were convictions because the concealed
handgun law doesn't disqualify people who are charged with a crime
but then acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cited offenses were drug and other nonviolent
convictions that were more than 20 or 30 years old. Those would
likely be of little interest to prosecutors. But many others were
were for murder, aggravated assault and other violent offenses,
some of them fairly recent.
</P>
<P>
   An undetermined number also involved people who had successfully
completed a special form of probation called deferred adjudication.
Those could legally possess firearms under state or federal law but
still couldn't obtain a state handgun license, the DPS said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Tela Mange said the DPS didn't turn the informatir to prosecutors because ``there were other things that were
more of a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that policy is being changed, since Bush and Texas
Attorney General John Cornyn have created a special program to
clamp down on gun violations.
</P>
<P>
   Under that program, dubbed Texas Exile, Cornyn is hiring eight
assistants to help state and federal authorities seek tougher
sentences for criminals who use guns.
</P>
<P>
   It is being funded with a $1.6 million grant from the governor's
office and was initially announced by Bush and Cornyn on Sept. 21,
a few days after a gunman killed seven people in a Fort Worth
church.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who signed Texas' concealed handgun law in 1995 and drew
criticism from gun control advocates during this year's legislative
session, has repeatedly called for tougher enforcement of existing
gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to ``vigorously enforce our current gun laws'' when he
announced the Texas Exile grant.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said Wednesday that the governor
learned earlier this fall that the DPS, whose governing board he
appoints, was not sharing its information about felons with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he became aware of it, Governor Bush provided
leadership to get DPS officials to start forwarding every one of
those cases to Texas Exile officials,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Mange said the DPS will send all records on handgun applicants
with criminal records to the Texas Exile program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pulled all the records that we've had at this point that
the Texas Exile prosecutors may want to look at,'' she said.
``We're sending everything over to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mange said the agency decided to change the policy within the
past several weeks, after learning of the new program. The attorney
general has been promoting it in news conferences around the state
this week.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was unclear what influence the inquiries from Butts,
the gun control lobbyist, may have had on the DPS' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Butts said that as recently as Oct. 5 _ two weeks after Bush and
Cornyn first announced Texas Exile _ the DPS' top lawyer told her
that information from felons' handgun applications wasn't being
forwarded to any other agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't clear to us at that point that these were the types
of cases they might be interested in,'' Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   Mange said none of the applicants tried to hide their criminal
records from the DPS. However, they apparently thought that since
their offenses were many years old or they had received deferred
adjudication, they could get a license.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Bill Blagg of San Antonio, whose district includes
the state capital, said he was unaware DPS had been withholding
information about felons and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors, he said, may not be interested in many of
the cases, particularly older ones involving nonviolent crimes.
However, he said he was glad to learn that the agency would now be
sharing its records with the Texas Exile program because ``that's
something worth looking into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a lot of people that you scoop up in that net
(the new crackdown),'' he added. ``There's going to be some worthy
targets for prosecution.''

FIVE CUBAN EXILES ACQUITTED IN PLOT TO KILL CASTRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS names of all of those acquitted in last graf) 
 (rk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a defeat for government prosecutors, five Cuban exiles
charged with plotting to kill Fidel Castro at a Caribbean summit
meeting two years ago were acquitted Wednesday of all the charges
against them by a federal jury in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district judge in the case, Hector Laffitte, had
already dismissed conspiracy charges against a sixth defendant for
lack of evidence. A seventh man, who is suffering from cancer, is
to be tried later.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the verdicts, after only about seven hours
of deliberations, brought tears from the defendants, the youngest
of whom was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The case was the first ever brought in the United States
charging a conspiracy to assassinate Castro. It also raised
questions about the activities of the powerful political group with
which several of the men were affiliated, the Cuban American
National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation, which lobbies on U.S. policy toward Cuba and
other issues, and the accused men insisted that they channeled
their opposition to the Castro government through wholly peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the defendants' intentions emerged as soon as Coast
Guard officers intercepted four of the men on a cabin cruiser off
Puerto Rico in October, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When the authorities discovered two huge .50-caliber sniper
rifles aboard the boat, one of the defendants, Angel Alfonso,
blurted out that the guns were his and that his ``sole mission in
life,'' was to kill the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
   In court, where only part of Alfonso's statement was admitted as
evidence, his lawyer, Ricardo R. Pesquera, said his client was just
bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   Without putting any of the aging defendants on the witness
stand, their attorneys accepted virtually all of the circumstantial
evidence the prosecution put forth: the contradictory statements to
Coast Guard officers; the preparation of the boat, the rifles, and
night-vision goggles; and the renting of a temporary apartment on
Venezuela's Margarita Island, where Castro met with other heads of
state from Latin American, Spain and Portugal in the first days of
November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while the prosecutors argued that the rifles and the
amateurish skullduggery were clearly directed at murdering the
Cuban leader, defense lawyers insisted that the men were peaceful
activists headed for the island to protest against Castro and
perhaps to help spirit away any members of his entourage who might
want to seek asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy, 5-foot sniper rifles, they said, were meant for
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the men had at times been associated with militant
anti-Castro activities, the prosecutors offered virtually no
evidence about the defendants' political backgrounds. At one point,
one of the prosecutors said the government was thinking of
presenting evidence of money transfers linked to violent events in
other countries, but it did not.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants were quick to claim a political
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a message to the U.S. government that you cannot be
so hypocritical,'' Pesquera said. He cautioned that he was not
admitting to any assassination plot but added: ``The United States
government tried on many occasions to kill Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome also confounded the expectations of some lawyers
that a jury of Puerto Ricans, whose politics tend to be liberal,
might have trouble finding common cause with militantly anti-Castro
Cuban-Americans. Defense lawyers seemed to have taken care of that
by taking every opportunity they could to compare the Cubans'
battle with Washington to those of nationalistic Puerto Ricans,
including the current furor over a Navy bombing on the Puerto Rican
island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, as the defendants congratulated one another
outside the courtroom, at least two of the jurors hurried over to
embrace them and then joined them for a celebration at a local
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a message to the Cuban community that we are
with them and that they should not give up hope,'' the jury
foreman, Carlos Avila, 27, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Alfonso, those cleared were: Jose Antonio Llamas, a
director of the Cuban American National Foundation; Angel
Hernandez; Jose Rodriguez Sosa, and Francisco Secundino Cordova.

U.S. HINTS AT RETURNING REFUGEE TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even as Elian Gonzalez, 6, wrapped in the arms of his
relatives, said he wanted to stay in Little Havana here, State
Department officials seemed willing Wednesday to consider reuniting
the boy with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who survived for two days adrift on an inner tube in the
Atlantic Ocean after a failed crossing from Cuba drowned his
mother, stepfather and nine others, told reporters at a small news
conference late Tuesday that he wanted to stay in the home of a
great-uncle and great-aunt, who have showered him with presents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy here,'' said his 21-year-old cousin, Marisleysis
Gonzalez. ``Let's not turn this into a political thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But State Department officials said Wednesday that they
recognized the rights of the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to
reclaim his child, and would send agents to meet with him in Havana
to discuss ``an appropriate resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Cuban-Americans, it seems as if the State Department,
which had at first said the issue of the boy's custody would have
to be settled in Florida courts, is capitulating, giving in to four
days of broad, well-organized anti-American protests outside the
United States diplomatic mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday in Washington on a wide range of
issues, President Clinton would not say how the case should be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, and I think the most important thing is, What
would be best for the child, and there is a legal process for
determining that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the latest effort by the boy's relatives to keep
him in Miami, family members applied on the boy's behalf for
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, who celebrated his sixth birthday last Sunday, is at the
epicenter of an international incident, complete with two sides _
the Cuban government and the Cuban exiles in Miami _ who have used
his predicament to advance their positions. The boy's face adorns a
billboard in Havana, and the Cuban government has trucked in
thousands of marchers, waving signs that read, ``We want Elian back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's exile neighborhoods, people say those protests are
disingenuous, at best, and just another case of Cuban President
Fidel Castro's manipulating his people for political gain. In
Little Havana, marchers protested Castro's efforts to turn Elian
into ``a little Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro, without being specific, has warned United States
officials that they will regret not returning the boy to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our commandante talks, they tremble,'' Elian's father
said in an interview with The Miami Herald. Gonzalez, who has said
he had to sell his car, a 1956 Nash Rambler, to pay for daily
long-distance telephone calls to his son, has refused to come to
Florida to fight for Elian in court. Castro has said that is
because the courts here are corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department seems ready to give Gonzalez a way
around the state courts. ``The regulations of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service recognize the right of a parent to assert
parental interests in an immigration proceeding,'' said James B.
Foley, a State Department deputy spokesman. ``The INS will be in
contact with Gonzalez in the near future to explain the process by
which it will evaluate his rights in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people here believe that if Gonzalez had the freedom to
speak his mind here, not only would he allow his son to stay but he
also would seek asylum himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only hostage here is the father, who is not being allowed
by the Cuban government to come here to the United States and make
the decision along with the family,'' said Ninoska Perez Castellon,
a spokeswoman for the Cuban-American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In a custody case involving any other country, experts on
immigration said, Elian would have already been returned to his
closest relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have been back a week ago,'' said David Abraham, a
law professor at the University of Miami who specializes in
immigration issues. Both American laws and treaties involving child
custody and abduction would provide for the boys' immediate return,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the correct legal thing to do,'' Abraham continued. ``You
must give custody to the surviving parent unless there is proof of
abuse or neglect.''
</P>

CLINTON DEFENDS HIS ROLE AT SEATTLE TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday defended his
handling of last week's failed trade negotiations, and said his
insistence that labor and environmental issues be central to the
talks was not intended to provide political cover for Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For days there has been sniping within his administration about
how the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle had gone so
wrong, and criticism from developing nations and free-trade
advocates at home that he had sacrificed an opportunity for a round
of trade liberalization to narrow domestic political interests. But
Clinton said it was unrealistic to believe that international
economic agreements could avoid dealing with issues like worker
rights and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In his first extensive remarks on the subject after rioting in
Seattle's streets and a deadlock around the negotiating table,
Clinton said at a news conference that he remained a strong
supporter of expanding free trade and optimistic that another round
of trade liberalization would eventually get under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the position of Americans, including some in my own
party, that trade is bad for America and bad for the world is just
dead wrong,'' Clinton said. ``I think that the world is more
prosperous, and I know America is more prosperous, because of the
continuing integration of the world's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had told the trade officials meeting in Seattle that
they should ``open up'' to the concerns of the demonstrators in the
streets. And Clinton had caused an uproar among poor nations by
saying that he would at some point support using sanctions against
developing countries that failed to live up to internationally
agreed upon labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton sought to explain his statement on sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world grows more interdependent, it is unrealistic to
think that there will be an international economic policy with
rules unrelated to an emerging international consensus on the
environment, an international consensus on labor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not mean I would cut off our markets to India and
Pakistan, for example, if they didn't raise their wages to American
levels,'' he said. ``I know that's what the sort of stated fear
was. I never said that. I don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had sought to address labor and
environmental concerns in trade agreements since the 1992
presidential campaign, when he supported ratification of the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada on the
condition that those issues be included.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, it is ``wrong'' to suggest that he
sabotaged last week's trade talks by pressing an agenda backed by
two constituencies vital to Gore in his pursuit of the Democratic
presidential nomination and the general election: organized labor
and environmental groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think I've got a good position here,'' Clinton said. ``It
has nothing to do with this campaign. It's a position I've had for
years, and I believe the world will slowly come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton and Gore face a tricky balancing act in the
coming months as they move on to the administration's next big
trade initiative: winning approval in Congress for China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor has made clear that it intends an all-out effort
against China's entry on the grounds that China exploits it workers
and threatens the viability of jobs in many American industries.
</P>
<P>
   But with the encouragement of the White House, business groups
are planning a lobbying counteroffensive to convince both Democrats
and Republicans that blocking a trade deal with Beijing will reduce
the ability of the United States to profit from China's rapid
growth and forgo an opportunity to promote democratic capitalism
and human rights through economic engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that the battle over China would be
difficult, and would be especially divisive among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good deal of support for it and a good deal of
opposition to it, and then some questions,'' Clinton said. ``But
I'm going to make an all-out effort to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would make his case on both economic and
strategic grounds, saying that the United States would be the big
winner from increased trade with China and that closer economic
ties would allow the United States to have a more constructive
relationship with the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would not single out China in pressing for
improvements in the rights and working conditions of its labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having China in a rule-based system for the
international economy is profoundly important, and I think it would
be a terrible mistake not to do it,'' Clinton said. ``Now, do I
agree with all their labor standards? No. But we shouldn't impose
conditions of membership on China that we don't impose on any other
country to get into the WTO.''

THE BANK OF SCOTLAND RAISES ANTE IN HOSTILE BID FOR NATWEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Bank of Scotland showed some fancy footwork but
failed to score a knockout Wednesday in its attempt to take control
of National Westminster Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Its hostile offer, which has been on the table since September,
has been rebuffed by NatWest and prompted the Royal Bank of
Scotland to make a counteroffer for NatWest last week.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, the Bank of Scotland raised the ante by providing
details on how it aimed to take over NatWest, a bank twice its
size, and planned to wring out 1.015 billion pounds, or $1.65
billion, in savings in the next three years from the combined
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Scottish bank, with revenue growth of about 15
percent a year, pledged that it would raise NatWest's revenue
growth by 5 percent a year, to about 10 percent to 11 percent
annually once their operations are combined.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the promised cost savings, it said it would integrate
the banks' back offices, merging their complex databases and
computer systems. While it took great pains to say it would not be
closing NatWest branches, it did say that it would shrink at least
half of the branches, in most cases moving them to smaller retail
spaces and cutting staff.
</P>
<P>
   Its rival, the Royal Bank of Scotland, made its intentions a bit
less, well, hostile. It does not plan to cut branches or integrate
back offices to the same degree that its rival said it would. But
it has yet to show how it would achieve its projected savings, at
1.18 billion pounds within the next three years, slightly greater
than its what its rival plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Phin, a stock analyst with Williams de Broe, said it was
hard to tell who would be the victor after attending the Bank of
Scotland's presentation. Bank of Scotland's pitch seems more
plausible ``because they showed us some substance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While NatWest has vowed to remain independent, ``the perception
from my vantage point is that NatWest's days are numbered,'' Phin
added.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of the offers is especially enriching to NatWest
shareholders at first glance. ``There's a greater chance now than
ever before that NatWest will remain independent,'' countered
Michael Lever, an analyst at HSBC in London. ``I can't recommend to
any NatWest shareholder to accept any of these bids.''
</P>
<P>
   NatWest's shares are trading 14 percent below the Bank of
Scotland's offer price of 1,552 pence a share. Shares of NatWest
closed down 1.8 percent at 1,336 pence. Royal Bank of Scotland has
fared worse. Its share price has fallen 18 percent in the 10 days
since it made its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Royal Bank's offer for NatWest is now valued at
only 22.8 billion pounds, or 1,364 pence a share, less than its
rival's bid.
</P>
<P>
   NatWest has been trying to fight off the hostile bids by
promising to sell four units, return more than 1 billion pounds of
capital to shareholders and cut costs by dismissing people. Its
board forced out its chief executive in October and gave its
chairman the additional power to help fend off suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sir David Rowland, NatWest chairman and chief executive, has
repeatedly said that the Bank of Scotland offer is poorly thought
out. ``Its proposals threaten significant losses and value
destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With NatWest pledging its own cost cuts, the promises of
combined savings with another bank are hard to evaluate. Merger
savings often prove illusory.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods found that only 2 of
15 banks that made acquisitions in 1997 and 1998 met their
per-share-earnings goal for 1999. It should be noted, though, that
the study looked only at United States banks and that European
banks generally have more fat, and thus a merger has a better
chance of reaching its savings goals through cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks typically project savings by cutting jobs and by selling
divisions. All too often, though, they do not take into
consideration the possibility of at least a short-term dip in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A National Westminster spokesman said a reduction in revenue of
6.5 percent would eliminate all of Bank of Scotland's claimed
savings.
</P>
<P>
   During any merger transition period, service disruptions and
change can cause customers to take their business elsewhere,
perhaps leaving lingering problems. The Bank of Scotland
acknowledged there could be transition problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer attrition will always happen during the transition,''
Phin said. ``It's what happens in the long term that matters.''

 &UR; SPORTS  &LR;  _ Just a few years ago, a Polaroid camera and a long piece
of wire constituted high-tech innovation in the National Football
League. Teams used to string that wire from the press box high up
in the stands down to the field. Assistant coaches in the box would
snap the self-developing photos of the game in progress and slide
them down to the field on shower hooks.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the players could get a bird's-eye view of how their
opponents were lining up against them. But now, new technology is
changing the way the most popular sports are played and broadcast,
and nowhere is that more apparent than in the NFL. Not only have
teams replaced that old Polaroid-on-a-wire with high-tech computer
printers on the sidelines that spit out better-quality digital
photos, but the league has gone totally wireless for on-field
communications. By Benny Evangelista

   &UR; SPORTSSIDE _ &LR;  In addition to on-the-field changes, new
technology is about to revolutionize the way sports leagues and
teams connect with their fans, according to a recent study. The
Internet will cause a ``power shift'' in the way sports
entertainment is delivered to fans, a Forrester Research Inc. study
concludes. Instead of relying on traditional television and radio
broadcasts, professional sports franchises will use the Web to
deliver merchandise and even the games themselves directly to their
fans. And aspects of sports that historically were considered
background information, such as player statistics, scores and game
highlights, will become commodities that generate revenue, said
Mark Hardie, Forrester senior analyst. By Benny Evangelista

worthwhile to see where he might score some synergies with his
other holdings. So when the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft
bought San Francisco's all-computing cable channel ZDTV last month,
the folks there were most cheered because Allen owns the country's
fourth-largest cable television company, Charter Communications.
But more intriguing was Allen's investment in Cnet, ZDTV's
crosstown rival. Not only is Cnet the most formidable competition
for ZDTV's onetime sister company ZDNet, but it also produces its
own television programming about computing, which airs on other
cable channels. Allen's Vulcan Ventures owned somewhat less than 10
percent of Cnet, enough to put Vulcan President Bill Savoy on the

<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. _ An 18-year-old Army private was convicted
Wednesday of fatally bludgeoning a fellow soldier whom he had
harassed for being gay but who feared expulsion from the service if
he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights proponents have said the court-martial here laid bare
the grave flaws in the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old victim, Pfc. Barry Winchell of Kansas City, Mo.,
was beaten to death with a baseball bat as he slept in his barracks
bed early last July 5 after what fellow soldiers testified was
months of vile name-calling, rumor-mongering and an inquiry into
his private life that was supposed to be forbidden under military
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's killer, Pvt. Calvin Glover, 18, of Sulphur, Okla.,
had pleaded guilty to a charge of unpremeditated murder. But
Wednesday he was convicted of premeditated murder, after details of
the final months of Winchell's life as a soldier subjected to
derision and fear were heard at the court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   The court of five officers and enlisted men Wednesday night
pronounced him guilty of premeditated murder, solely measuring how
calculating Glover had been in the assault. He will be sentenced
Thursday and could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that the victim, fearful that protesting the
harassment to superiors meant risking expulsion from the service as
a homosexual, had been taunted by Glover into a fistfight. Winchell
won the fight handily at the end of a night of barracks drinking.
But the humiliated loser, Glover, retaliated with a baseball bat
two days later as Winchell slept, bludgeonng him in premeditated
revenge, the Army charged.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to the lesser charge and hoping for leniency,
Glover accused a second defendant, 25-year-old Specialist Justin
Fisher of Lincoln, Neb., of supplying the baseball bat and goading
him into the assault. ``I was just so drunk,'' Glover tearfully
told the court Monday. ``I had no intent for him to die.''
</P>
<P>
   The court-martial, replete with testimony about widespread
drunkenness and barracks harassment and routine denunciations of
Winchell by fellow soldiers as ``a faggot,'' ``a queer'' and a
``homo,'' was treated by the prosecution as purely a murder trial.
The Army has made no comment on the case's possible implications
for its controversial policy toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   But gay-rights organizations contend that the slaying is a
classic example of a hate crime rooted in homophobia, and that the
Clinton administration's ``don't ask'' policy, far from making life
easier for gays and lesbians in the armed services, has left many
to suffer in silence or leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, the policy has seen a doubling of
discharges of gay service members, to 312 last year, and a
comparable increase in complaints of homosexual harassment,
according to pro-gay organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This murder has shut down any illusions soldiers had,'' said
Michelle Benecke, co-executive director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, a gay-rights organization that monitors military
justice, in underscoring the Pentagon's failure to circulate
guidelines on its gay policy until after the slaying of Winchell.
``Every day, service members in every service must endure anti-gay
epithets and threats.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In testimony at the trial and in a preliminary inquiry here last
summer, witnesses said that Glover, after being struck in the face
and thrown to the ground in his challenge to Winchell, seethed with
embarrassment, shouted homophobic curses and threatened to kill
him, declaring, ``It ain't over.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that Winchell, a machine gunner in the 101st
Airborne Division, had been called a homosexual by his roommate,
Fisher, who is facing a separate court-martial Monday on charges
that he was an accomplice in the slaying and lied to investigators.
Glover's defense team sought to bring out from witnesses that
Fisher was a dominant, manipulative individual while the accused
private was subservient and a braggart.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge, Col. Gary Holland, told the court that the
critical question was whether Glover, amid a long weekend of
barracks drinking, partying, and bickering, had opportunity to
``cool off'' from a point of initial rage and premeditate the
assault. Of Fisher, the judge stressed it had been stipulated as
fact that ``he's the one who handed the accused the bat'' and
``told him to go out and mess up'' Private Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the slaying, a military policeman testified,
Fisher, his clothes covered in blood, stood by the ambulance
shouting, ``Let him die! Let him die!'' as Winchell was taken to
the hospital. In the earlier hearing, Fisher swore that Glover
spewed homophobic epithets before the assault and confessed to the
slaying as he hurriedly washed blood from the bat. When the two
checked on the stricken Winchell, Fisher said, Glover lifted his
bloodied head and said, ``Yes, he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified that the assault was so severe that
Winchell's face was unrecognizable, with his eyes swollen shut and
his head cracked open. Glover fled the scene, according to
testimony, and threw bloody evidence in a dumpster. He was later
arrested in his room by investigators who said they found blood
stains on the door and on his clothing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Fisher accompanied Winchell to the Connection in
Nashville, Tenn., a nightclub favored by gays, according to
witnesses, and gossip soon went around the post that the Winchell
was homosexual. Testimony established that Winchell had dated a
female impersonator at the club, Cal Addams, a former Navy medic
known as Calpernia, who eulogized Winchell last July as ``a kind,
calm gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everybody in the company called him derogatory
names,'' Winchell's platoon sergeant, Michael Kleifgen, testified
at the pre-trial hearing. ``They called him a `faggot' and stuff
like that, I would say on a daily basis. A lot of times, he was
walking around down in the dumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the military's ``Don't ask'' stricture, Kleifgen
testified last summer that he decided to informally investigate
after Fisher described the nightclub visit without identifying
Winchell. The sergeant said he suspected that Winchell was gay but
Winchell denied this. The sergeant dropped the matter, he
testified, finally acknowledging to the amazement of some in his
audience, that ``the military has a policy of `Don't ask, don't
tell.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the sergeant said he did nothing to enforce
Army regulations against the sort of harassment that Winchell was
suffering. ``Everybody was having fun,'' the sergeant said in
explaining his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   In the welter of harassment and epithets, several witnesses
testified, a few soldiers complained of homophobic denunciations of
Winchell by ranking superiors. But nothing came of their
complaints, the witnesses said. ``We did a formal IG complaint and
nothing was done, sir,'' Kleifgen testified Wednesday, referring to
the inspector general's office here. The Fort Campbell public
affairs office said it would inquire into the reported complaint to
see what might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy introduced by the Clinton administration, the
military cannot inquire into a soldier's sex life unless there is
clear evidence of homosexual conduct. But gays who volunteer this
information can be discharged for being homosexual. After the
Winchell slaying and reports of white supremacists in the Army,
Clinton signed an executive order in October that amends the court
martial manual to allow judges to weigh hate-crime factors in
meting out sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a service member was killed because of his sexual
orientation was beating death of Alan Schindler, a Navy petty
officer who was assaulted by two shipmates in October 1992, aboard
the USS Belleau Wood.

 Firm Tracking Web Users Has Upbeat Debut  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Despite its underdog status in the Web-tracking business, shares of
Milpitas' NetRatings Inc. popped 64 percent, or $11, to close at
$28 yesterday in its first day of public trading.
<P>
   NetRatings raised $68 million by selling 4 million shares at $17
each, up from the $14 to $16 range it had initially planned.
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings is backed by Nielsen Media Research, &UR;  &LR; known for its
television ratings. The companies jointly market a service called
Nielsen/NetRatings, which uses panels of computer users to
extrapolate the numbers and characteristics of Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers and Web sites pay for detailed reports to decide
where to place ads and learn about the demographic profiles of
their visitors. Nielsen/NetRatings has 170 customers compared with
more than 500 for Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   In its prospectus, NetRatings said it expects to one day rule
the Web measurement business, although it now plays second fiddle
in both number of customers and revenues to Media Metrix of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the market for Internet audience measurement
services will eventually gravitate toward a uniform standard based
on data collected by a single service provider,'' the prospectus
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it acknowledged that Media Metrix, of New York,  &LR; ``as the
first mover in this market, has a head start in becoming the
industry standard for such services.''
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix representatives could not be reached late
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview yesterday, Steve Gross, NetRatings vice
president of finance, said NetRatings' advantage is Nielsen's
respected sampling methodology.
</P>
<P>
   NetRatings is partnering with AC Nielsen, a separate and also
well-regarded polling company, to handle sampling in foreign
markets, Gross said. NetRatings owns 19.9 percent of the joint
venture with AC Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for NetRatings is that it is well positioned
to measure audiences in the event that computer and television
technology merge, the prospectus said.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate
purposes. The funds may also be used to acquire complementary
businesses and technologies, the prospectus said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 EBay Halts Auction of Seattle Riot Memorabilia  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Days after the riots in downtown Seattle over the World Trade
Organization, rubber bullets, spent tear gas canisters and broken
police clubs turned up for sale on eBay.
<P>
   But yesterday, the online auction site decided to halt bidding
on the items because it couldn't be sure who actually owned them _
the Seattle Police Department or the protesters who kept them as
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to guess the motivation of people selling
these items,'' said Kevin Pursglove, an eBay spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Carmen Best, a spokeswoman for the Seattle Police
Department, said she had no idea if the department would claim
ownership of the disputed goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'd have gone back and collected the stuff,''
she said. ``I don't know if we'd have arrested anyone for theft.''
</P>
<P>
   Best also didn't know if the Police Department would have any
use for used gas canisters and rubber bullets even if officers had
gone to the trouble of rounding them up after the protests.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday afternoon, the only item listed on eBay under
``Seattle riots'' was 216592258: Footage showing police going up
against demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers welcome,'' it said. ``About 2 hrs of protesting and
unconstitutional beatings /bring down those responsible for the
mayhem _ the government!!!''
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of days, however, the site contained a
number of protest-related items, including a ``tear gas fun pack''
selling for $102.50 (it attracted five bids) and a police baton
selling for $51 (it drew six bids).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in violation of our user agreement in a number of
areas,'' Pursglove said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, rubber bullets and used tear gas
canisters could be considered weapons, which eBay doesn't allow to
be sold on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the items could be considered government property, and
you can't sell that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they might still be the property of the Seattle cops,
and eBay takes a dim view of users fencing stolen goods on the
site.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't like it when people try to sell human organs,
babies, and other such oddities that have popped up in recent
months. But that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove said the Seattle items were spotted by vigilant eBay
users, who self-police the site and report any contraband they come
across. He said all offending items had been pulled from bidding by
yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But one enterprising seller, Adam Cohn, re-posted his items at
his University of Washington home page. They included two tear gas
canisters, two detonated concussion grenades, a broken police club
and ``a handful of rubber bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On November 30 and December 1, 1999, protesters took to the
streets of Seattle to prevent the convening of the World Trade
Organization,'' Cohn wrote. ``The cops did their darndest to keep
the unruly mob at bay and resorted to all sorts of entertaining
devices including those offered in this rare package!''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said he is keeping track of the e-mail addresses of those
who bid for his offerings on eBay and will contact them in the
future.

ADVERTISING: BREAKING DOWN WHEN, WHERE AND HOW YOUNG ADULTS GET
INFORMATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By JANE LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new study by BBDO New York of consumers'
perceptions of the media says that newspapers have the most
traditional image of all media and that the Internet has replaced
television as the favored medium for escape.
</P>
<P>
   The method used by BBDO New York might at least be partly
responsible for the conclusions. To conduct the study, the agency,
whose clients include Campbell Soup, FedEx, Mars, the New York
Stock Exchange, PepsiCo and Visa, interviewed 104 adults, ages 22
to 34, in eight markets across the United States in September. The
relative youth of the group might have influenced their perceptions
of the newest medium _ the Internet _ as well as their thoughts on
one of the oldest, newspapers. BBDO New York is a unit of BBDO
Worldwide, whose parent is the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   This possible bias notwithstanding, the study appears to confirm
beliefs previously held by advertising and marketing executives on
the roles various media play.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Olshan, executive vice president and director of strategic
operations at BBDO New York, said the study stemmed from the notion
``that if the medium is the message, then the consumer's view of a
given medium could contribute to or detract from the image of an
advertised brand.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked at the reasons consumers use each medium; who
consumers think uses each medium; and the psychological rewards
consumers say they get in using each medium.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents said they used the Internet for escape and mental
stimulation and to obtain specific information on travel, business
and health issues. Users were perceived positively, as young
career-oriented adults. Respondents said using the Internet gave
them feelings of innovation, intelligence, creativity, power and
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents said they read magazines for information on current
fashions, recipes and health issues and to reward themselves. They
perceived magazine readers as being physically attractive; they
also said reading magazines gave them feelings of sexiness,
self-esteem, luxury and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Olshan, magazines ``have the most aspirational
image among all major media.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``People go to them to reward themselves. Sitting
down with a magazine takes time; it implies you have time. It's a
nice feeling, a relaxing thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that respondents watched television for
entertainment, to end the day or to spend time with family. Viewers
were perceived largely as homemakers and families, while
respondents said watching TV gave them feelings of happiness,
comfort and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Radio was perceived as a background medium, to be listened to
first thing in the morning or while doing other things. Listeners
were seen as young and hip, while respondents said radio gave them
feelings of peacefulness, relaxation, inner harmony and
youthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents said they also read newspapers first thing in the
morning and to obtain in-depth news, financial and sports
information, and movie reviews. Readers were perceived as
middle-aged or older, more often male than female. Respondents said
reading newspapers gave them feelings of tradition, stability,
security, maturity, respect and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olshan said these findings suggested that TV was an ideal
medium for advertising products that entertained or were associated
with fun, like soft drinks, candy or amusement parks. Magazines
make the most sense, she said, for luxury products and beauty and
fashion brands, while newspapers are suited to advertising for
technology and e-commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers using the Internet must address consumers' desire for
mental stimulation and escape in their advertising, she added,
while radio advertising must find a way to move its messages from
the background to the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Ms. Olshan said it was important for marketers to
consider the image of a medium when deciding where to advertise
because this can reinforce the desired image of a brand.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Silver, senior vice president for advertising and
brand management for Visa USA, said she was pleased the Internet
``had a well-developed profile in the study.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I'm glad to see its profile has moved beyond geeky
guys, that there's mainstream stuff going on.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the study had confirmed her intuition about the
use of different media, but that it ``was not changing my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The most noteworthy section of the study, according to Jim
Spaeth, president of the Advertising Research Foundation, was its
definition ``of the appropriate slice of the pie for the Internet''
_ something he said he had not seen measured or documented before.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers were more skeptical of BBDO's findings, however.
Roger Lavery, a professor at the Adcenter at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond, warned: ``They need to be careful making
this all too tidy. Marketers like things tidy, but unfortunately,
the world isn't that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Ephron, a media consultant in New York, called the study's
findings ``very superficial,'' and questioned the size and age of
the group surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   BBDO New York executives said they were likely to do surveys of
consumers who are younger and older than those polled in September.

BUSH TO SEEK MATCHING FUNDS IF HE WINS GOP NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Karl Rove, chief political strategist for George W.
Bush, confirmed Wednesday that the Republican presidential
front-runner plans to seek federal financial help for his general
election campaign if he wins the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising prowess, which has netted his campaign a
record $70 million in nine months, has enabled him to forgo federal
matching funds through the 2000 Republican convention this summer
and avoid spending restraints during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign season was too short for a similar
fund-raising juggernaut, Rove said. ``It is awfully difficult to
raise $60 million between the time you get the nomination (in late
summer) and the November election.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the matching fund system, the federal government matches
up to $250 of each individual donation to a candidate who agrees to
abide by state-by-state spending restrictions. The Republican and
Democratic presidential nominees will be eligible for up to $66
million in taxpayer funding for their fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your candidate attending a lot of fund-raisers.
You want him out shaking a lot of hands,'' Rove said. ``There's a
limited number of days from August to November, and it would be
awfully difficult to raise that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing polls that show Bush with a double-digit lead over
his Republican opponents nationally but tighter races in early
primary states, Rove predicted that ``the numbers will tighten
appreciably.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, a survey released by the American Research Group
showed Bush trailing U.S. Sen. John McCain by 7 percentage points
in New Hampshire, the nation's first-primary state. A separate
survey by Zogby International showed Bush behind McCain by 3
percentage points among New Hampshire Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a rough patch or two in the road,'' Rove
said. ``But we have built a campaign that is able to endure and win
and compete everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about assertions by Bush's Republican opponents that he
might lack the intellectual muscle to occupy the White House, Rove
said: ``It's the burden of the front-runner to take the slings and
arrows shot his way by others.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove acknowledged that Bush comes across better in person than
he does on television, but predicted that he would improve in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five days, Gov. Bush has doubled his debate
experience,'' Rove said, referring to candidate forums in New
Hampshire and Arizona in the past week and his debates against
former Gov. Ann Richards in 1994 and Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got some support about his television demeanor from a voter
at a Bedford, N.H., town-hall meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the man said he watched Monday's debate and found Bush
intelligent enough to be president, Bush responded: ``I'd rather be
underestimated than overestimated. I've been underestimated before
_ and Governor Richards regrets it.''
</P>
<P>
   About the perception that Bush smirked at his opponents in New
Hampshire and Arizona, Rove said voters ``will make their judgments
about the whole person'' and not facial expressions. ``Does he come
across better when he's sitting two feet away from you? You bet,''
the strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brief fascination with whether it was a smirk or a smile
will pass quickly,'' Rove predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush was in New Hampshire focusing on high
technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   But other issues crept in, as a voter asked Bush at a Manchester
high-tech town hall meeting, if he would pardon Michael New of
Conroe, who was convicted for refusing to wear U.N. insignia. ``I
don't know enough about the case but I'll tell you what I will tell
you: We're never going to put U.S. troops under U.N. command,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared alongside Jim Barksdale, founder of Netscape, in
an interview on WMUR-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated his support for extending the moratorium on
taxing Internet commerce for three to five years, and he stated his
opposition to taxing Internet access. Texas this year removed
Internet access from state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say let the Internet develop,'' Bush said. ``It's important
the next president understand the power and the promise of the
Internet, the power and promise of technology. The Internet can
change how we educate our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said the most important issue to the technology
industry is education, and he said Bush has been a leader among all
the presidential candidates when it comes to improving public
education. Barksdale said the industry is short about 300,000
workers because U.S. schools are not producing students interested
in math.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president has to be knowledgeable. That doesn't mean
he has to be a technologist,'' Barksdale said.

 _ SF CHRON   Paul Allen Loses Interest in Cnet After Buying Crosstown Rival 
 ZDTV 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whenever Paul Allen makes an investment, it's worthwhile to see
where he might score some synergies with his other holdings. So
when the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft bought San Francisco's
all-computing cable channel ZDTV last month, the folks there were
most cheered because Allen owns the country's fourth-largest cable
television company, Charter Communications.
<P>
   But more intriguing was Allen's investment in Cnet, ZDTV's
crosstown rival. Not only is Cnet the most formidable competition
for ZDTV's onetime sister company ZDNet, but it also produces its
own television programming about computing, which airs on other
cable channels. Allen's Vulcan Ventures owned somewhat less than 10
percent of Cnet, enough to put Vulcan President Bill Savoy on the
Cnet board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy is not to be, however. Vulcan has been unloading its
stake in Cnet, and Savoy has left the board. In August, Vulcan
announced its intention to sell 850,000 shares of Cnet, for $29.9
million, and last month, the company said it would sell an
additional 2 million shares for $97.1 million, according to filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After those sales, Allen's stake in the company will be
``basically zero,'' said Cnet spokeswoman Karen Wood. ``He was the
first big investor, other than friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Allen pumped $5 million into the company in 1994 and
1995. As much as his money helped, his reputation in the industry
also gave the fledgling firm a big boost in credibility.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Cnet repaid the favor: Adjusting for splits, its
stock is worth more than 10 times as much as when the company went
public. Adjusted for splits, the IPO prices was $4. Yesterday, Cnet
closed at $64.06.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ZIFF STAFF ZILCHED &QL; 
Sometimes when a big media firm is sold, the corporate powers cut
in the little guys who helped build the company. Such was the case
earlier this year when CMP Media was sold to Miller Freeman, and
such was also the case in years past when Ziff-Davis was first sold
to an outside investor.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis's publishing unit was sold yet again this week, but
employees shouldn't look for any bonuses in their holiday
paychecks. Although some ``key employees'' will see benefits as
their stock options vest, Ziff spokesman Robert Borchert said there
will be ``nothing like CMP's lump-sum payment.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Ziff's magazines, the most dominant in the computer
industry with such titles as PC Magazine and PC Computing, follows
ground broken by the sale of Wired magazine last year. In the Wired
sale, Advance Publications' Conde Nast bought the magazine, and
then several months later, Lycos bought the Web properties.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, investment firm Willis Stein &AMP; Partners bought Ziff's
publishing properties for $780 million, but not the hot Internet
site ZDNet. ZDNet gets about one-fourth of its content from Ziff
magazines and will continue to do so for at least five years under
a licensing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Conde Nast, which did not get the rights to the
www.wired.com domain name, Willis Stein owns the domain names
associated with Ziff's magazines and could pull them from ZDNet
after the deal expires in five years, Borchert said. But why
speculate? ZDNet has not yet been sold _ and its controlling
investor, Softbank, may choose not to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Borchert points out, ``Five years is an eon in Internet
time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SALON TV: &QL; 
In the desperate rush to get established, Internet companies
typically buy ads in old media and even search out ways to put
their content on television and in newspapers. But Salon.com chief
executive Michael O'Donnell said television programmers had been
courting the hip San Francisco Web company in an effort to
transport its literate content to the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Salon announced a deal with Rainbow Media Holdings, a
subsidiary of giant Cablevision Systems Corp., to produce a show
based on its Internet content that will hit the air next spring.
Rainbow owns the cable film and arts network Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a corporate initiative to get on television as
much as it was traditional media coming to us,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of show is still up in the air, but don't look
for a new sit-com or cops drama. It could be a talk show, it could
be a news show, and it could be something completely different,
said Salon spokeswoman Emma Hurley. ``We haven't ruled anything out
and we haven't decided anything for sure,'' she said. Whatever it
is, she said, it ``will certainly reflect Salon's character and
Salon's attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the site's own show on the air is certainly a better
move than just buying more ads. ``The advertising space is so
cluttered right now on television that an actual TV show with
references to the Web site will do more to increase traffic than a
30-second spot,'' O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Salon founder, Chairman and Editor in Chief David Talbot is
leading the effort to develop the show, but he has high-powered
help: Salon counts on its board of directors television pioneer
Norman Lear (producer of ``All in the Family,'' among many other
shows) and former CBS President Jim Rosenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Salon has pushed into other media as well, publishing books,
selling its writings via the United Features Syndicate and creating
radio for use online and on the air.
</P>
<P>
   With its foray into television, Salon is following in the
footsteps of many other Internet companies, like Cnet,
MarketWatch.com and TheStreet.com, which have launched their own
cable shows.
</P>
<P>
   These deals, in which new media firms use established media to
make a name for themselves, have a strange evolutionary feel to
them. After all, what happens to the television networks and print
products that take ads and give airtime to Internet firms once
those companies are the giants?
</P>
<P>
   They probably won't die, like dinosaurs giving way to mammals.
The old media brands will survive, but they'll all be Internet
companies as well.

A PRESIDENT'S REFLECTIONS AS HIS FINAL YEAR NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, alternately wistful and wonkish,
reflected Wednesday on the fate of a Cuban boy torn between feuding
family members, on a year marked by numerous policy defeats and on
the legacy of the figure he pronounced the century's greatest,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong news conference, Clinton once again displayed his
mastery of minutiae while also seeming a bit subdued as he
contemplated his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared painfully aware that he was presiding
alone now over a White House that for most of his tenure was run by
a troika that included the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is preparing to move out of the White House to run
for the Senate from New York while Gore has all but abandoned his
vice presidential duties, including his weekly lunches with
Clinton, to seek the Democratic nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Mrs. Clinton's decision to pursue her own political
career, Clinton said he was ``very happy for her,'' without exactly
sounding so. He said the two of them spoke at least once a day by
telephone when apart but admitted it was not an ideal situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's not the best arrangement in the world, but it's
something that we can live with for a year,'' the president said.
``But I've got a job to do, and she now has a campaign to run, and
so we'll have to be apart more than I wish we were. But it's not a
big problem. She'll be here quite a lot, and I'll go up there when
I can, and we'll manage it and I think it will come out just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The session with reporters was held in the Dean Acheson
Auditorium at the State Department, relocated from the White House
because the East Room, the traditional site of presidential news
conferences, was crammed with holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked whom he regarded as the ``Man of the Century''
and responded with a long, articulate essay on Franklin Roosevelt,
complete with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes' assessment of the new
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, you know,'' Clinton said, ``when Franklin Roosevelt was
first elected, Oliver Wendell Holmes was still on the Supreme
Court; he was 92 years old. And he was taken _ President Roosevelt
was taken to see Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was still reading Plato
in his 90s and all that. And Holmes was a pretty acerbic fellow
when he said, after meeting Roosevelt, that he thought he might not
have had a first-class mind, but he certainly had a first-class
temperament, and he did. He understood that reality is more than
the facts before you, it is also how you feel about them, how you
react to them, what your attitude is. That was the _ `the only
thing we have to fear is fear itself' was much more than just a
slogan to him, he had lived it before he asked the American people
to live it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's answer betrayed his obsession with his place in
history as his political career wound down. Clinton has told
friends that he regrets that he was never tested by war or
depression and thus could never secure a place among the nation's
greatest leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But on a more current note, the president offered little
guidance to a state court in Florida that is struggling with the
case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who drifted ashore
on an inner tube two weeks ago. His mother and stepfather drowned
in the crossing. His father, who lives in Cuba, wants him returned,
while relatives in Miami are seeking permission to keep him in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The matter has become highly politicized because Fidel Castro
wants the boy sent back to Cuba while thousands of vocal Cuban
expatriates in Florida insist the child will be better off in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to give an opinion on how he would like the
painful case resolved, but the tone of his answers revealed a hint
of the sadness of a boy whose own father was killed in an
automobile crash before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course, I think all fathers would be sympathetic,''
Clinton said. ``The question is, and I think the most important
thing, is what would be best for the child, and there is a legal
process for determining that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ``I can't serve any useful purpose by commenting
on it because I don't know enough about the facts of the family
life or even the governing law on this.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point in the news conference, the President was
offered an opportunity to confess error or crime in the Monica
Lewinsky affair and curtly declined. He offered no revision of his
view that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, had overstepped
his authority and criminalized a trivial matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake I made was self-inflicted,'' the president said,
``and the misconduct of others was not.''

</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   Installing Netscape as Preferred Browser 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I got my new Power Mac G4 hooked up last night, but when I
clicked on my ``Browse the Internet'' icon, what should come up but
Microsoft Internet Explorer! Yech. What is it doing on my Mac? Part
of the reason I stay with Mac is to avoid Microsoft. It feels dirty
and creepy to have IE. I even have to use the Microsoft Outlook
program for my e-mail. Is there a way to get Netscape Navigator 4
and another e-mail program?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet _ in fact, they're already on your hard drive. Back
in 1997, in exchange for a $150 million investment by Microsoft,
Apple agreed to make Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Outlook
Express the Mac's default Web browser and e-mail application,
respectively. But to this ,day Apple continues to load Netscape's
software, too, on all new Macs.
</P>
<P>
   To find it, open the Internet folder on your hard drive. At
first glance you may not see any sign of Netscape (apparently Bill
Gates even got to design the window layout), but if you scroll down
to the bottom of the window, you should see an icon that points to
Netscape Communicator, a mega-application that combines the
Navigator browser with Netscape's Messenger mail program, plus a
calendar, news reader, Web-page editor and other features.
</P>
<P>
   To make Netscape your default browser, so it will open
automatically when you double-click the ``Browse the Internet''
icon, go to the Apple menu, then to Control Panels, and select the
Internet control panel. Click on the tab labeled ``Web.'' At the
bottom of the window, find the pop-up menu labeled ``Default Web
Browser'' and set it to Netscape Communicator.
</P>
<P>
   If you also want to make Netscape's Messenger module your
regular mail program, stay in the Internet control panel but switch
to the E-mail tab. There, a similar pop-up menu lets you set
Communicator (or any other mail program you'd like) as your default
for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Video Plug-and-Play
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to include some images from video in a newsletter I
produce on my iMac. Since there are no expansion slots on the
machine, how can I add a frame grabber?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: USB to the rescue! Every iMac includes ports for something
called the Universal Serial Bus, a truly plug-and-play way to
connect external peripherals to your system. It doesn't move data
fast enough for high-quality motion video _ for that your best bet
is a new iMac DV and a digital camcorder _ but it works fine for
single frames or low-resolution, compressed video clips.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least three USB devices for the Mac that can handle
this job with aplomb. The least expensive, Logitech's QuickCam VC
($79.95 list price), is mainly intended to function as a Webcam or
video-conferencing camera, but it can also capture still images and
sequences from other video sources at resolutions up to 352 by 288
pixels (www.logitech.com/us /cameras/ca29100.html).
</P>
<P>
   InterView USB from a company called XLR8 ($99 list) captures
high-quality video at up to 320 by 240 pixels and stills at up to
twice that resolution (www.xlr8.com/interview/index.html). It comes
with a full, though slightly out-of-date version of Strata's
capable VideoShop video-editing application.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dazzle Multimedia's Digital Photo Maker (also $99 list)
offers much higher resolutions for stills _ theoretically, up to
1,600 by 1,200 pixels _ and also captures video in MPEG format at
up to 320 by 240 pixels. It's a recent port from the PC world, but
I recently tried it out on an iMac and it worked well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AirPort for PowerBooks
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a PowerBook G3, and I just picked up new iMac DV,
which has a slot for an AirPort card (Apple's new wireless
networking product). Can I add an AirPort card to the PowerBook, so
I can surf the Web with it from my deck?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't add the Apple card, because the company doesn't
make a version that's compatible with current PowerBooks, but you
can add a third-party equivalent. My advice, though, is to wait a
month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless networking cards that will fit in your PowerBook's PC
Card (a.k.a. PCMCIA) slot are available from a growing list of
companies, including Lucent (the company whose technology is behind
AirPort), Farallon (longtime experts in Mac networking) and Dell
(the PC giant). These three companies, like many others, base their
products on the same standard Apple uses, known as IEEE 802.11. In
theory, they should be compatible with the AirPort products.
</P>
<P>
   So why wait? Three reasons: First, most of the third-party
802.11 products you can buy today are based on an older version of
the standard that's limited to 2 megabits per second, compared to
the 11-Mbit rate AirPort can support. Third-party products matching
AirPort's speeds are just now coming on the market, but for the
moment, they're not easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   The slower and faster versions are supposed to be
``interoperable'' _ i.e., you can combine them on the same network
_ and in real life the speed difference isn't as great as it
sounds. But unless you're desperate to starting surfing from that
deck this winter, you might as well wait for the faster cards to
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there's the question of a base station, the device you
need to connect a wireless local-area network to the Internet. When
Apple unveiled AirPort last summer, it announced a stand-alone base
station, which is now available at $299.
</P>
<P>
   But the company also said then that any Mac with an AirPort card
and a wired Internet connection (via modem or Ethernet) would be
able to function as a base station for other machines with AirPort
cards but no direct Internet connection of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Apple hasn't delivered this feature yet; it's
scheduled to be added in an upcoming update to the AirPort
software, but the company won't set a date. So even if you could
get a card for your PowerBook today, it would be useless unless you
also shell out for Apple's hardware base station (or a third-party
equivalent). If you wait for the software, and it works as
advertised, you can save the $300 or so by letting your iMac do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that the cutting edge can make your life a
bloody mess. The whole point of standards is to ensure
compatibility among different vendors' products, but the reality is
that it sometimes takes months for them to get everything working
smoothly together. So even after the new cards appear, you might
want to let someone else test the promise of interoperability.
</P>
<P>
   An Apple tech note on AirPort compatibility with older Macs is
at til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf /artnum/n58521. For a very
thorough hands-on assessment of the technology, including tips on
setup and notes about some problems and limitations, see
www.macintouch.com/airport.html. I especially enjoyed Part II of
that review, which includes details about the effects of hair
dryers, microwave ovens, cordless phones and other appliances on
AirPort performance.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Gridiron Goes Wireless _ New Technology Makes Life Easier
for  Football Coaches 
 &HT;     Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Just a few years ago, a Polaroid camera and a long piece of wire
constituted high-tech innovation in the National Football League.
<P>
   Teams used to string that wire from the press box high up in the
stands down to the field. Assistant coaches in the box would snap
the self-developing photos of the game in progress and slide them
down to the field on shower hooks.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the players could get a bird's-eye view of how their
opponents were lining up against them.
</P>
<P>
   But now, new technology is changing the way the most popular
sports are played and broadcast, and nowhere is that more apparent
than in the NFL. Not only have teams replaced that old
Polaroid-on-a-wire with high-tech computer printers on the
sidelines that spit out better-quality digital photos, but the
league has gone totally wireless for on-field communications
</P>
<P>
   Wireless headphones, speakers and pagers have all become as
integral to the game as blitzes, stunts and sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it a lot easier for coaches on the sidelines to
anticipate what's going to happen,'' said Bobb cq  &LR; McKittrick, the
longtime offensive line coach for the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change this NFL season is the return of video
instant replays as a tool for coaches to challenge officials'
rulings, the most direct use of technology in any sport. With
instant replay, coaches can protest certain calls made by game
officials, who consult replays from various angles to either uphold
or change their on-field verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL scrapped an ineffective, heavily criticized instant
replay system using a TV monitor and videotape that was employed
from 1986 to 1991. This time around, the league has brought in
computerized digital playback equipment that allows officials to
use touch screens to instantly find up to seven different angles
for any play in question.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the revised new  &LR; instant replay is a new wireless
communication network that connects coaches, quarterbacks and
referees.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, head and assistant coaches patrolling the
sidelines were physically tethered by phone cords connecting their
communication the  &LR; headsets they used to talk to each other &LR;   &LR; to a
central hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, many coaches had someone carry the cord, to keep
it coiled so it wouldn't get tangled,'' McKittrick said. ``If you
had four coaches with an extra person to carry the wire, that's
eight people on the sidelines. It was so frustrating. You were
always getting your cord tangled or someone was always standing on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the league switched to a wireless system designed
specifically for football by Telex Communications Inc. of
Minneapolis and provided to the NFL this season under a marketing
agreement with Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The system includes a combination headset-microphone connected
to a belt pack worn by each coach. The belt pack transmits the
radio signal, digitally encoded to prevent the opposing team from
learning key secrets, to a central receiver-transmitter on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitter relays the audio to assistant coaches in the
press box or onto the field to the quarterback, who has a small
speaker inside his helmet next to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   If the head coach wants an instant replay, he presses a button
on the belt pack that activates a beeper worn by the game referee
and umpire on the field. It also sends a signal to the replay booth
officials in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The replays shows up on special monitors on the field and the
booth. Fans watching the game at home would see the same set of
replays on TV that the on-field referees use to review their calls.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have only 30 seconds after a play is over to request an
appeal and, ``It's come right down to the microsecond,'' McKittrick
said. But with the wireless system, he said, coaches no longer have
to yell and scream above the crowd noise or frantically wave their
arms to get the officials' attention, or for that matter, to get
the next play to the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the country's major college football teams,
including Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley, now use a version of the NFL's wireless headset system,
said Peter Amos, general manager of CoachComm, an Alabama company
that markets the devices to college teams. At about $45,000 for
each system, Amos said smaller colleges have balked at the cost.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Internet Getting In on the Game  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In addition to on-the-field changes, new technology is about to
revolutionize the way sports leagues and teams connect with their
fans, according to a recent study.
<P>
   The Internet will cause a ``power shift'' in the way sports
entertainment is delivered to fans, a Forrester Research Inc. study
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relying on traditional television and radio
broadcasts, professional sports franchises will use the Web to
deliver merchandise and even the games themselves directly to their
fans.
</P>
<P>
   And aspects of sports that historically were considered
background information, such as player statistics, scores and game
highlights, will become commodities that generate revenue, said
Mark Hardie, Forrester senior analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2004, the sports power shift will dictate new roles for the
major players in the sports marketplace,'' Hardie said. ``The
Internet will become more than just another distribution channel.''
</P>
<P>
   In four years, advertising on sports-related sites should top $4
billion annually, while the Web will account for about 15 percent
of revenues for U.S. professional sports leagues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball and hockey fans who have the best seats at New York's
Madison Square Garden this season are getting an early glimpse at
that power shift.
</P>
<P>
   CSI Inc. of New York has installed interactive touch-screen
monitors on 557 courtside seats at the Garden and on 100 seats in
Tropicana Field, home of baseball's Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   With the ChoiceSeat screens, courtside basketball fans can view
replays of Latrell Sprewell slam dunks from up to eight different
camera angles and then pull up how many three-point shots he has
made in his career. They can also order a drink or buy a souvenir
Knicks jersey from their seats.
</P>
<P>
   The screens are linked through an intranet in the Garden, but
eventually, CSI plans to make the same replays and data available
to fans at home via the Internet, said Barry Goldberg, a CSI vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   CSI, which has Intel Corp. of Santa Clara as a minority
investor, hopes to install more ChoiceSeat screens in outdoor
stadiums like the new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other NHL and NBA teams have already installed a computerized
system designed by IBM that compiles the official game statistics,
video clips, and a real-time play-by-play of the game to send out
instantly on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 50 U.S sports franchises showed that individual team
Web sites now generate an average of $100,000 in revenue, mainly
through ticket sales, Hardie said. By leveraging the fan-drawing
power of the stats and highlights they already have, teams can
expect to increase their Web site revenues to an average of $1
million per team by 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, instead of selling blanket broadcast rights to local
stations or national networks, teams may license rights to
statistics, ticket sales, merchandise or live telecasts of games in
progress to a variety of Internet outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have a big network partnering with a dot-com,''
Hardie said. ``It's not inconceivable to see CBS and Yahoo put
together a football deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports purists may argue that all the high-tech gadgetry
detracts from the enjoyment of the games on the field or court,
said Susan Hofacre, professor of sports management at Robert Morris
College in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But the encroachment of technology in sports is inevitable,
especially in pro sports, where team owners are constantly trying
to stay ahead of rising player salaries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sports can't rely on just the sports purists,'' said
Hofacre, who is originally from Walnut Creek. ``They have to do
everything they can to appeal to the casual fan. In five or 10
years, people will simply accept it in the same way as people who
used to think instant replay was distracting.''

FRENCH FIND CIGARETTE MAKER PARTLY LIABLE IN CANCER DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a ruling that could open a European front in the war
against tobacco companies, a French court ruled Wednesday that
Seita, maker of the Gauloise and Gitane brands of cigarettes, was
partly responsible for the death of a three-pack-a-day smoker from
lung cancer and cancer of the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision is the first time that a tobacco company
has been held responsible in a health liability case in France,
where smoking is widely accepted. The court case is also one of the
few anywhere that a tobacco company has lost.
</P>
<P>
   Seita, a formerly state-owned company known for the acrid
Gauloise cigarettes that habitually dangle from the lips of
millions of French people, said it was stunned by the decision and
would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling caused a 4 percent drop in Seita's shares and came
just as the company is about to merge with Tabacalera, a Spanish
competitor, forming one of the world's biggest tobacco producers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Seita could ultimately win the case, tobacco industry
analysts acknowledged that the ruling had broken some new ground in
smoking litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is relevant because it's the first in France, and it's
one of the few that have been won against the industry,'' said
Martin Feldman, a tobacco industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The court came up with a complicated formula for responsibility.
It held that the smoker, Richard Gourlain, who smoked up to three
packs of filterless Gauloises a day for about 35 years, was also to
blame for his illness. Gourlain, who died earlier in the year at
49, apparently started smoking when he was 14.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that Seita could be held responsible for the
years that Gourlain smoked when he was a teen-ager and partly
responsible for the years he smoked as an adult before the company
put health warnings on cigarette packs in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said that even if it is upheld on appeal, the
ruling in the civil court of Montargis, a town about an hour south
of Paris by car, is unlikely to have the far-reaching effects of
recent anti-tobacco litigation and government initiatives in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money that plaintiffs can win in France is
relatively small. The French courts do not award punitive damages,
and class-action suits do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The total amount of money Gourlain's widow, Lucette, is asking
for is less than $500,000, and the court, by ruling that her
husband had been partly responsible, seemed to indicate that
payment would be less than that. The court set a three-month
deadline for an evaluation of the compensatory-damages claim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said that the case might still have an effect on
Seita's stock because investors have been frightened by the
developments in the United States. In a class-action suit filed on
behalf of 500,000 ill Florida smokers, a jury held in July that big
tobacco companies like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds were liable
for their pain, suffering and lost wages. The suit is now in its
second phase, where the size of the penalty is to be determined.
Some legal experts have predicted that the damage award could run
$300 billion to $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the French ruling, Joanna Scharf, an analyst at the
Arnold &AMP; S. Bleichroeder investment firm, said: ``Even if it
stands, this case will not be a big deal because there is not
enough money in it. But psychologically, this is very bad. There
will be investors who are scared by it. They look at what happened
to Philip Morris, and they will just want to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Seita said in a statement that it ``cannot be held responsible
today for the choice, which is one of individual responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also was the first instance of a suit holding a
tobacco company responsible for a cancer death had gone so far in
Europe, where efforts to take tobacco companies to task have proved
tougher for plaintiffs than in the litigation-happy United States.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the difficulty is that lawyers are
reluctant to bring cases that they think will take years of work
and that they are unlikely to win. In many countries, lawyers
cannot operate on contingency fees, which promise a big payout in a
courtroom victory, with losers paying the winner's legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of the American litigants has prompted an
increase in the cases in Europe, experts said. In June, for
instance, a local branch of France's national health system brought
suit asking major cigarette makers, including Reynolds, Rothmans
International and Philip Morris to pay nearly $10 million for the
cost of treating lung and throat cancer since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in Cracow, Poland, a court began hearing a
case against Seita and Philip Morris brought by a Polish citizen
demanding 2.3 million euros ($2.36 million) in damages for causing
his mother's death from lung cancer in July.
</P>
<P>
   While still alive in December 1996, Gourlain originally brought
suit against Seita. After his death, his widow continued the
action, arguing that the company provided insufficient information
about the health risks of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that between 1963 and 1969, Seita was entirely
responsible for Gourlain's smoking because it failed to provide
sufficient information on the health risks. Between 1969 and 1976,
the court found Gourlain to be 40 percent responsible for his
illness and Seita 60 percent responsible.
</P>
<P>
   After 1976, when the government made health warnings mandatory,
the court found Seita to be no longer responsible in Gourlain's

MICROSOFT AND ERICSSON TO CREATE WIRELESS INTERNET VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ericsson of Sweden and Microsoft Corp. will create a
joint-venture company to market and deliver mobile e-mail and other
Internet services for wireless network operators, the companies
said Wednesday. Ericsson, the world's third largest mobile phone
maker, will own a majority of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Ericsson will provide its Wireless
Application Protocol to Microsoft and will adopt Microsoft's Mobile
Explorer, a new version of its Internet browser, in future cellular
phones. Ericsson officials said the partnership did not mean that
the company would use Microsoft's Windows CE operating system in
its wireless devices at this time, although they did not rule
anything out. Microsoft said it expected to start shipping Mobile
Explorer in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
   On NASDAQ on Wednesday, Microsoft's stock closed at $91.8125,
down $1.1875. Shares in Phone.com, a Redwood City, Calif., company
that already produces browser software for cell phones, fell
$12.625, or more than 8 percent, to $142. In Stockholm, a 12
percent rise in the shares of Ericsson led the Swedish market to an
unusual daily gain of 5.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal should help Ericsson regain market share
lost to Motorola and to Nokia of Finland, and it represented
another significant step in Microsoft's efforts to be a major
competitor in wireless networking. Microsoft has entered into a
similar joint venture with Qualcomm, called Wireless Knowledge, and
has made a number of acquisitions of companies with wireless
technology or software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Microsoft can't jump-start the wireless-data industry
single-handedly,'' said Alan Reiter, president of Wireless Internet
and Mobile Computing, a consulting firm in Chevy Chase, Md. ``This
is one step in Microsoft's attempt to be a major player in wireless
data, but it's certainly not going to be a slam-dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Ericsson officials said their venture would
concentrate on building, marketing and deploying products that use
Microsoft's Windows NT Server and Exchange programs and Ericsson's
infrastructure and mobile Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mobile Internet is part of Ericsson's vision of convenient
and user-friendly information access and wireless e-mail,'' said
Kurt Hellstrom, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson officials said the partnership with Microsoft did not
diminish the company's commitment to Symbian, a consortium it set
up with Psion, Nokia and Matsushita of Japan, in part to keep
Microsoft from realizing the kind of dominance in the wireless
industry that it achieved in personal computer software. Symbian
has created a standard operating system, called EPOC, for wireless
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Symbian executive vice president Juha Christensen said he did
not see the deal as a threat. ``Obviously, every time we see people
with a competitive offering, we get a little apprehensive,'' he
said. But in this instance, he said, ``We don't have a competitive
offering,'' adding, ``In the long term it's very difficult for
anyone who wants to play in the corporate space to avoid Microsoft
because they own all the desktops.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said this deal, coming on the heels of a recent
one in which Nokia agreed to use the operating system of Palm
Computing, presented trouble for Symbian and its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Strike 2,'' said Andrew Seybold, an industry
consultant in Boulder Creek, Calif. ``Symbian, instead of being on
the inside looking out, could be on the outside looking in.'' But
he noted that none of the wireless partnerships to date were
exclusive deals. ``Nobody knows what the winning combination of
wireless communications and information service is going to be,''
he said. ``This is all posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, the link with Ericsson provides credibility in
winning deals with major wireless carriers. ``Microsoft, in order
to be competitive in the wireless arena,'' Seybold continued, ``has
to get into the carriers' back-end infrastructure some way because
that's where all the smarts are. Ericsson is a trusted back-end
supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   David Readerman, a managing director of Thomas Weisel &AMP;
Partners, said the sheer numbers in the wireless market made it
attractive to Microsoft even if it would never achieve the
dominance it has in desktop computing. ``Certainly in Europe, the
installed base of handsets is soon to exceed the installed base of
PCs,'' he said. ``This may not represent the classic annuity stream
for Microsoft, but they need to be there. It's a major strategic
move.''

CLINTON ASSERTS NASA'S EXPLORATION MUST GO FORWARD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton dismissed suggestions Wednesday
that NASA should scale back space exploration after the space
agency's recent loss of two unmanned spacecraft destined for Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to failed missions in which astronauts died, Clinton
said NASA has faced greater setbacks and Americans have remained
undaunted in their pursuit of frontiers in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing compared to the tragedy when those astronauts
burned to death when their spaceship was still on the ground,''
Clinton said. NASA ``didn't quit, and America didn't quit ... and I
don't think we should quit now.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was referring to the 1967 launchpad deaths of
astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Shaffee. Clinton did not
mention the January 1986 Challenger explosion in which seven crew
members were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The president also defended NASA administrator Dan Goldin, whose
``faster, better, cheaper'' approach to space travel has been
blamed for recent failures by some critics.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin ``has adopted a lot of economy measures and gone for
smaller, more discreet missions ... that I think make a lot of
sense,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   While NASA conceded this week the Mars Polar Lander that entered
Mars' atmosphere Friday is likely gone forever, Goldin has become
the agency's toughest critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly something is wrong, and we have to understand it. It
is conceivable that we will completely change our approach'' Goldin
said earlier this week. ``Everything is on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to appoint a panel to look into what went wrong, and
members of Congress announced this week they will hold hearings on
the matter in February. The loss of the $165 million Mars Polar
Lander and its $29.2 million probes proved especially distressing
to NASA officials after a navigation error caused the $125 million
Mars Climate Orbiter to go off course and disappear in September.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was supposed to receive signals last week when the Polar
Lander touched down on the surface, generating electrical power and
preparing to photograph its surroundings. When the signals never
came, it raised the question of whether the Polar Lander and the
attached Deep Space 2 probes ever separated from the rocket stage
that delivered them from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   While officials hope to pinpoint why the spacecrafts
disappeared, they acknowledged little information is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, there is a possibility we may never know what
happened to the lander,'' said Carl Pilcher,NASA's director of
solar system exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, officials are searching for ways to prevent
future spacecraft causalities.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mars Polar Lander failed to signal back to Earth,
officials suggest future probes include larger radio transmitters
and greater supplies of electrical power.
</P>
<P>
   NASA may begin to scale back the scope of future missions and
search for ways simply to ensure a mission may succeed, Pilcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, NASA has considered postponing missions to Mars
scheduled for 2001, 2003 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 operation involves a spacecraft similar in design to
the Mars Polar Lander, so ``obviously, we are not going to go ahead
and just launch this spacecraft,'' Pilcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and others say setbacks are to be expected, although
they want to know how such errors can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to take a space ship the size of a boulder and
throw it ... into a very uncongenial atmosphere and hit a target
(248 million miles away). And it isn't easy,'' Clinton said. ``We
all use the slogan: `Well this isn't rocket science.' Well, this is
rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress downplayed the financial impact of the
loss. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who chairs the House Space
and Aeronautics subcommittee, said he would rather see NASA lose a
``$200 million spacecraft than a billion dollar one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the failure of this project underscored the validity
of a cheaper, faster, better model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin implemented the ``cheaper, faster, better'' model after
the disappearance of the $1 billion Mars Observer in 1993, which
Goldin said put too much pressure on NASA not to lose the
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Pilcher said NASA will not revert to the days of
high-stakes exploration but may pursue a more cautious course. ``We
may need to let the pendulum swing back the other way and examine
if we are on the right course.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of recent setbacks, support has waned for an eventual
manned mission to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This failure should give pause to the people who want to
maneuver us to a manned mission to Mars, which would cost us
hundreds of billions of dollars ... and that is just
unreasonable,'' Rohrabacher said.

GORE CONCEDES SOUR ECONOMY MIGHT CAUSE TAX RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Replaces GORE-RUSSIA)

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After days of lacerating former Sen. Bill Bradley for
acknowledging that he might have to raise taxes, Vice President Al
Gore Wednesday admitted that if the economy took a turn for the
worse, he would not rule out a tax increase either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under current economic circumstances, I have no intention of
proposing any tax increase,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed by a reporter as to whether he was flatly
ruling out ever raising taxes, he said, ``I am ruling them out
under circumstances that approximate what we have today,'' and
added, ``Nobody has a crystal ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here Wednesday night, he elaborated, saying he
would not raise taxes ``under current circumstances, or anything
remotely similar to current circumstances, so long as we have a
surplus, so long as we have a balanced budget, so long as we don't
have a deep economic crisis of some kind that changes the
circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president took a reporter's pen and notebook and drew a
grid to explain his position on taxes as well as Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``current circumstances,'' he wrote: ``AG: No New Taxes!''
For Bradley, he wrote: ``BB: ``May Raise Taxes ... to pay for
health care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But under ``unknown future of Economy,'' he wrote: ``AG:
Possibilities Hard to Rule Out.'' For Bradley, he wrote ``BB:
same.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Bradley campaign's ears, Gore was finally acknowledging
that the two candidates' positions were the same.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley, responded almost
triumphantly to Gore's remarks Wednesday, saying, ``It's clear that
the vice president is in the same place as we are, and it makes me
wonder why he spent the better part of a week attacking a position
he holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were gleeful at the sight of Democrats fighting over
taxes. At a news conference Wednesday morning in Washington, Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, called
Gore and Bradley ``the Frick and Frack of higher tax,'' adding,
``The only difference between Bradley and Gore is that Bradley
admits he'll raise our taxes, while Gore wants us to believe he'll
limit himself to raising taxes on smokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a challenge by Bradley on Monday that Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential contender, take a
pledge not to raise new taxes, Nicholson said Bush already had, as
have all six of the Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute in the Democratic race reflects the widely accepted
view in politics that any mention of taxes is poison to a campaign,
whether it is realistic or not.
</P>
<P>
   The examples are seared in the nation's consciousness: Walter
Mondale, the Democratic nominee, said during his 1984 campaign that
a tax increase was nearly inevitable, and he lost 49 states to
Ronald Reagan. And when President George Bush's famous assertion to
voters _ ``Read my lips: No new taxes'' _ was violated, he too was
consigned to history.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says Gore has completely distorted what he said about
raising taxes. In a transcript of an interview with The Washington
Post, where the issue first came up last week, Bradley never
specifically asserted that he would raise taxes. In fact, he was
nearly as vague then as Gore was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was asked by The Post if a tax increase might be
necessary. According to the transcript, Bradley roamed all over the
question, saying at first, ``You tell me what the growth rate is,
I'll give you the answer.'' He added: ``You have to deal with it at
the time.'' But he said that his desire to provide near-universal
health care coverage was non-negotiable, and depending on what else
happened, the options were ``cutting spending or increasing
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore in the interview in Manhattan, after helping children light
a menorah at the 92nd Street Y, said: ``If you're talking about the
unknown future of the economy, you can't begin to rule out
possibilities. But I have no intention of it. His position is the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore insisted there was a difference in their positions,
too. ``Under our current economic circumstances, I rule it out,''
he said. ``Under our current economic circumstances, he doesn't
rule it out. He has to say that he may have to raise taxes because
he cannot explain the huge gap in his health care plan.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After three hours at the hilltop palace in Damascus,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left her meeting with
President Hafez Assad of Syria on Tuesday, drove straight to the
American ambassador's house and made a secure call to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the groundwork had been laid in previous diplomatic
meetings, Albright clearly had good news to report. She had
apparently broken through an impasse and found a formula that would
allow direct Israeli-Syrian negotiations to resume after nearly
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's absolute condition for re-entering negotiations _ that
Israel agree to turn over the Golan Heights down to the border of
June 4, 1967, the border that defined the land Syria held on the
eve of the Arab-Israeli war that year _ had melted into a
negotiable position.
</P>
<P>
   Assad repeatedly cited that condition because he considered it
the point where negotiations with the Israelis, under Yitzhak
Rabin, the assassinated prime minister, had broken off. The
Israelis did not agree, and the disagreement over where
negotiations ended had bedeviled the effort to rekindle talks.
</P>
<P>
   Assad decided, in his meeting with Albright, that he no longer
required a public confirmation of his viewpoint before negotiations
began. He agreed to the Americans' proposed formula, which
deliberately allows what diplomats call a ``constructive
ambiguity'' _ talks will resume where they left off, with the
understanding that each side will emphasize different points about
the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, after Albright arrived late in Israel, both
she and Clinton separately telephoned Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Albright said merely that she was more hopeful that
the negotiating track could be ``re-energized'' than she had been
when she flew into Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, after she met Barak at his residence here,
the two took their place before microphones for a news conference.
Barak appeared to be in particularly good spirits, beaming, making
wisecracks and playing the jovial host to a Hanukkah breakfast.
Mocking his own habit of declaring meetings ``fruitful'' when he
does not want to reveal more, he pronounced the breakfast meeting
``literally fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither he nor Albright would say whether there had been
progress with Syria. ``I cannot predict it,'' Barak said. ``It's
too early. It takes two to tango.''
</P>
<P>
   Things had appeared solid enough during their breakfast meeting,
though, that Barak called Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
during their conversation. He alerted Arafat to the potential
development and sought to assure him that Israel would not abandon
its intense, and until now undistracted, focus on final status
negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Their deadline to reach an outline for a final peace agreement
is 68 days away.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the Israeli leader had two more phone
conversations with Clinton, who also spoke with Assad, a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m. Washington time, Clinton was ready to announce that
Barak would meet with Farouk Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, in
Washington next week. Israeli-Syrian negotiations were not only
resuming, but, unlike previously, they would be at the highest
political level, with following meetings also expected to be
between high political officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Albright will both attend the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Previous diplomatic meetings were conducted at the technical and
ambassadorial levels. ``To move up to the highest political level
is a major, major change in this area and will echo around the
Mideast in profound ways since Syria is a critical country that
Israel has not had these discussions with before,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   As he said during the news conference, Barak was more than ready
to begin the talks. ``We have so many other things to do other than
to be deployed for another generation or two along the borders and
bury our youngsters, and let the others bury theirs,'' he said.
``So it's time to make decisions. I feel, somehow, the opportunity
is clear also to President Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we know all that we can know about his positions,
and he knows all that he can know about our positions, short of
making the decision,'' Barak continued.
</P>
<P>
   Under Barak's two predecessors, there were periodic contacts but
no face-to-face negotiations between Syria and Israel. His
immediate predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, held conversations
through an American businessman, Ronald Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   When he took office in July, Barak pledged to withdraw Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon within a year. The pledge was
originally based on the expectations that talks with Syria would
resume, and that the withdrawal from Lebanon, much of which is
controlled by Syria, would be done in the cooperation with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   On taking office, Barak immediately began wooing Assad through
public messages complimenting his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Assad responded, sending equivalent messages of
interest the Israelis' way.
</P>
<P>
   Five months passed with little overt progress, but the Americans
were working on the Syrians during this time. Clinton and Albright
both met with Shara, on several occasions. Diplomatic messages
traveled back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the withdrawal from the Golan Heights discussed
substantively, but so were security arrangements, issues such as
water, and the timetable for carrying out the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was being made when Shara had an aneurysm, was
hospitalized and underwent bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is also reported to be in frail health, although Albright
found him to be vigorous and in full command during their meeting,
a senior administration official said. He is expected to take part
in future talks, although Shara will represent Syria for now.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beside Albright at a news conference at his compound in
Ramallah Wednesday night, Arafat looked wan and said little. But he
praised the revival of Israeli-Syrian negotiations as ``good news
that will bring happiness to the Palestinian people and all the
Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that Israeli-Palestinian final status talks,
briefly disrupted before her arrival, would continue and that
Arafat would visit Washington early next year to meet with Clinton.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros have reached an agreement on a three-year contract
extension with second baseman Craig Biggio, a source said
Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the contract is
believed to include an average annual salary of $8 million to $9
million, which would make the seven-time All-Star the highest-paid
player in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement could be made today.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio already was signed for the coming season; the extension
should keep him in an Astros uniform through 2003, when he will be
37 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker declined comment, as has
been his stance throughout the negotiations. Biggio's agent, Barry
Axelrod, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, 33, has been in the Astros organization since 1987, when
he was selected in the first round of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   He hit .294 with 16 homers, 73 RBIs, 28 stolen bases and a
club-record 56 doubles in 1999, becoming only the sixth player in
history to reach the 50-doubles mark in back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was a trade rumor circulating Wednesday,
linking Astros lefthander Mike Hampton and the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to confirm or deny conversations about specific
players,'' Hunsicker said. ``But I am going to the winter meetings
to explore all the options we have to improve the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players that are going into the last year of their
contracts are candidates to trade until we get to a point where we
know that we can sign them past the 2000 season.''
</P>

FDA SAYS MAN KILLED IN GENE THERAPY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN
EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs to add material about Gelsinger's earlier coma in 15th
graf.)  (DW) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Officials of the Food and Drug Administration
said Wednesday that they had concluded that Jesse Gelsinger, the
18-year-old Arizona man who lost his life in a gene therapy
experiment in September, was ineligible for the clinical trial and
should not have been treated because his liver was not functioning
well enough before doctors infused him with a dose of corrective
genes.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the preliminary results of a three-month inquiry
into Gelsinger's death, the officials also said the University of
Pennsylvania scientists running the study had violated FDA
requirements by failing to report immediately information about two
patients who, months before the death, had experienced serious side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   They said the informed-consent form that the investigators gave
patients deviated from the one the agency had approved, in that it
omitted information about the death of monkeys that had received a
treatment similar, although much more powerful, to the one given
Gelsinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the impact of these deviations are'' on
Gelsinger's death, said Dr. Kathryn Zoon, director of the agency's
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which monitors gene
therapy studies. But ``they're important,'' she said, adding that
when the agency concluded its inquiry, it will take ``appropriate
action.'' She declined to say what that action might be.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Wilson, the lead scientist for the Penn study,
vigorously defended his conduct. In interviews, Wilson, who directs
one of the most respected academic gene therapy programs in the
country, has said repeatedly that there was no evidence from either
animal or human testing that could have foretold Gelsinger's death.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement he read to reporters Wednesday, Wilson
maintained that at the time Gelsinger was enrolled in the study _
three months before he was treated _ blood tests showed that his
liver was functioning within the study's parameters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain fully comfortable'' with the decision to treat him,
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that he had not telephoned the FDA
immediately with information about the other patients' side
effects, Wilson said the agency had been given the data in writing
eight months before Gelsinger died. He did not address the issue of
the informed-consent form, and he did not take questions.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Gelsinger's treatment, aired in dueling news
conferences, lent a bizarre, circuslike air to the first day of a
three-day session of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, the
National Institutes of Health panel that oversees gene therapy
research. The meeting room here was packed with scientists,
reporters and others, observers, including Paul Gelsinger, Jesse's
father, who sat in the back and quietly took notes on a yellow
legal pad.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gelsinger, said he remained supportive of the
scientists at Penn. ``These guys didn't do anything wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is not scheduled to hear formal presentations from
Wilson and the FDA until Thursday. Inside the meeting room,
Wednesday's session stuck strictly to the agenda, as a parade of
gene therapy researchers reported about the safety and toxicity of
adenovirus, the weakened cold virus that was used as a ``vector''
to deliver healthy DNA to Gelsinger and the 17 other patients
treated in the Penn study.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the meeting, Wilson, trailed by press aides and a
lawyer, scrambled to figure out how to respond to the FDA's
allegations, first reported in a Washington Post article.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is likely to intensify concern over the conduct of
researchers in the field of gene therapy, a nine-year old field
that has had few treatment successes but, until the Penn study,
never resulted in the death of a patient. Officials at the advisory
committee have complained that some other gene therapy researchers
beyond Wilson have failed to make public their safety data, as NIH
guidelines require.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the committee will discuss new rules that will force
greater openness.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Penn study has generated so much controversy is
that Jesse Gelsinger was not sick before he died. He suffered from
a mild form of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a rare,
hereditary metabolic disorder in which his liver was unable to
process ammonia, a toxic breakdown product of protein. When ammonia
builds up in the blood, it can travel to the brain, causing coma
and death; Gelsinger's ammonia levels were kept in check through
diet and drugs, although he had slipped into a coma eight months
before he was treated in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The Penn gene therapy study was not designed to benefit people
like Gelsinger; it was to test the safety of a treatment for babies
with a fatal form of his disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the advice of medical ethicists, the Penn scientists
decided it was not proper to test the treatment on babies. So their
study called for stable adults, including female carriers of the
defective OTC gene and men, like Jesse, who had what scientists
call a ``partial enzyme deficiency,'' to receive the treatment: an
infusion of the adenovirus vector, with the OTC gene tucked inside
it. The infusion was given through the hepatic artery, to directly
to the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and doctors who treat genetic disorders, including
some who reviewed the experiment for the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee, raised questions about the study's safety from the
outset, and those questions are being now being raised anew.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy experts have known for some time that adenovirus
provokes an immune system response that frequently includes high
fevers. In Gelsinger's case, his temperature rose to 104.5 degrees
the night after he received the gene infusion. Following the fever,
he experienced jaundice, then a blood clotting disorder. His
ammonia levels began to rise uncontrollably; he then suffered
kidney failure, lung failure and brain death.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Dr. Holmes Morton, an expert in
metabolic diseases who runs the Clinic for Special Children, a
nonprofit clinic in Strasburg, Pa., said there was enough evidence
about the side effects of adenovirus to raise serious doubts about
the wisdom of giving it to someone with OTC Deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said high fevers are particularly dangerous for someone
like Gelsinger, and might have triggered the subsequent reactions.
``Any time a patient with that disorder is stressed by illness, and
in particular anytime they develop a fever, their underlying
disease becomes not only unstable but life threatening,'' Morton
said. ``That, in a sense, is a quite predictable problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. W. French Anderson, the scientist who conducted the
first gene therapy experiment and who is regarded as the father of
the field, said he was convinced it was reasonable to proceed with
the experiment and that if there had been any lapses, in the end
``those will all turn out to be honest mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that in a busy lab, like Wilson's ``sometimes things
fall through the cracks. What this meeting is doing is to tighten
everything up.''

MANDELA TACKLES TOUGH ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the first day of his tightly orchestrated trip to
Seattle, Nelson Mandela made it clear his speeches would be filled
with more than gracious thank-you's and bland pleasantries.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of events that took Mandela and his wife, Graca
Machel, from a morning welcome at Boeing Field to a black-tie
benefit dinner downtown, Mandela spoke with quiet firmness and
characteristic humor about a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela chided the United States for flouting the United
Nations, spoke of the dire poverty faced by many children in
Africa, implored business leaders to address the AIDS epidemic and
personally thanked the anti-apartheid protesters in Seattle who
fought for him while he was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In some of his most pointed remarks of the day, Mandela told a
special meeting of the Seattle Rotary Club that the United States
had no right to take certain military actions without going through
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take a decision with Britain to go and bomb Iraq without
going through the United Nations, to go and bomb in Kosovo together
with NATO without going through the United Nations, we condemn that
in the strongest sense,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has led to comments, which I don't believe (are) true,
... that now that the United Nations is led by a black man, that
the United States has lost respect for that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That black man is U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of Ghana,
who spoke last week to the Rotary Club during the World Trade
Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and Machel's three-day trip was planned to bring
together the couple's considerable moral capital with the financial
capital of the Northwest's growing philanthropies.
</P>
<P>
   The Craig and Susan McCaw Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation created an itinerary focused on issues Mandela and
Machel are trying to address through their own organizations. These
include health care, education, peace, conflict resolution and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's fund-raising dinner at the Seattle Sheraton Hotel
attracted about 800 people who paid at least $250 per plate. For
$1,000, guests were invited to a reception and got their photos
taken with Mandela and Machel.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's packed itinerary Wednesday kicked off with a
welcoming ceremony at Boeing Field, where hundreds of Seattle
schoolchildren greeted them with cheers and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   As they walked from McCaw's jet to the podium set up in a
hangar, the couple stopped to shake hands and kiss some of the
children pressing against the velvet ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting; it was surprising,'' said Courtne Clark, a
student at Leschi Elementary School. ``It made me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks addressed to the children as much as the community
leaders and politicians on the dais, Mandela talked about why
children's issues are so important to him.
</P>
<P>
   He told the story of a cold winter day when a group of children
asked why he loved them enough to give part of his Nobel Peace
Prize money to help children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying we enjoy no parental love and security,''
Mandela said. ``We have no future because we are the outcasts of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   It was because of them that Mandela gave one-tenth of his salary
to help children. With the support of American businessmen, he
built schools around the country. Mandela exhorted the children
gathered before him Wednesday to stay away from drugs and alcohol
and work hard in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to reach the position of the presidency like Bill
Clinton, like George Bush, ... you must listen carefully to your
teachers,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela made a point of thanking the anti-apartheid
demonstrators who helped move his cause forward when he was in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief, but emotional, meeting after the ceremony, Mandela
personally thanked a small group of Seattle anti-apartheid
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without the international community, the people of South
Africa would have won, but the struggle would have cost a lot of
bloodshed and suffering, and the fact that the anti-apartheid
movement came to our assistance certainly made that struggle less
costly,'' said Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison, much of it in
solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying `thank you' and I kept saying `thank you' to
him, because I think he's done more for us than we did for him,''
Maryamu Eltayeb-Givens, the last president of the Seattle Coalition
Against Apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Selma Waldman, who served as the historian of the coalition,
said that meeting Mandela was an honor. But after all of the years
of reading his speeches and protesting against anti-apartheid, the
activists almost felt like they already knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's layer after layer of meaning and freedom and
justice,'' Waldman said. ``You know, you do win a few.''
</P>
<P>
   At a special meeting of the Seattle Rotary Club, Mandela was
treated to a special performance by the Seattle Symphony and handed
the baton to lead the symphony and a choir of high school students
in the South African national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks at the Rotary Club meeting, Mandela focused on
the ``poverty, squalor, ignorance and disease'' that are the daily
companions of so many people in South Africa and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where it is taboo to talk about sex, Mandela and
Machel have worked to find ways to address HIV, which has infected
millions of Africans. In a kind of prelude to the Global Health
Forum that Mandela and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates will lead Thursday
morning, Mandela implored the U.S. to help educate Africans about
AIDS and help with medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's remarks included a call for the U.S. to pay its United
Nations dues, lift the sanctions on Libya and aid in a more
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he visited small business owners and community leaders in
the Central District, where a small crowd spontaneously gathered to
wave and cheer as the motorcade drove off from the Manning
Childcare Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out off of my sickbed to see him,'' said neighborhood
resident Sylvia Wesley, who was nursing a cold but wore a delighted
grin. ``He waved to us, he smiled. That made me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   At Madrona Elementary School, Mandela shook the hand of
fourth-grader Keyaunna Johnson, who had thanked him in a letter for
``coming to make peace.'' He patted the awed child's cheek and
politely asked, ``Are you the principal of this school?''
Starstruck, the girl softly replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyaunna later said that she had learned about Mandela in class
but already knew his face _ his portrait hangs in her family's
living room along with those of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm
X.
</P>
<P>
   Madrona Principal Rickie Malone praised Mandela as ``a man who
shook up a nation, and then went on to shake up a world.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone had worked in both the civil rights and anti-apartheid
movements, joining regular Saturday pickets of the house of the
South African counsul in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela signed a souvenir for Malone _ a picture she has kept
throughout the years of herself picketing against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed Nelson Mandela Foundation promotes health care,
education, peace and conflict resolution on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   Machel, the former minister of education in Mozambique, helped
form the Foundation for Community Development, which is concerned
with economic development, health care and other needed programs in
Mozambique and other African countries.

   MICROSOFT JOINS ERICSSON IN A WIRELESS WEB VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson of Sweden, the mobile phone maker, and Microsoft said
they would create a joint venture to market and deliver mobile
e-mail and other Internet services for wireless network operators.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Ericsson will provide its Wireless
Application Protocol to Microsoft and will adopt Microsoft's Mobile
Explorer, a new version of its Internet browser, in future cellular
phones. Shares of Microsoft closed at $91.75, down $1.25, while the
American depository receipts of Ericsson rose $5.125, to $64.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS PAUSE FROM RECENT RALLY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks closed mostly lower as investors took a break from their
recent buying spree in the technology sector and failed to find any
reasons to buy stocks in the broader market. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 38.53 points, to 11,068.12. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index declined 5.29 points, to 1,403.88, while the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 0.84 point, to

<P>
   BANK OF SCOTLAND DETAILS OFFER
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland provided details on how it intends to take

savings from the combined operations. But neither its offer nor
that of its rival, Royal Bank of Scotland, is especially enriching
to NatWest shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WORLDCOM EXECUTIVE TO RESIGN
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom said that Timothy Price, the president and chief
executive of its largest unit, the communications group, would
leave on Feb. 28, the third resignation by an executive of the
former MCI Communications since it was acquired by Worldcom last
year. MCI Worldcom did not say why he was leaving. Known for his
marketing savvy, Price is credited with helping turn MCI into
AT&AMP;T's biggest rival before the Worldcom buyout.
</P>

CHEATING ON SCORES CHEATED THE CHILDREN, SAY PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Valerie Wright, 37, of the South Bronx said she began
to suspect that her sons' school was encouraging cheating two years
ago when her older boy came home one day and said his practice test
was a lot like the citywide reading exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was after the fact, so I didn't do anything about it,'' she
recalled Wednesday as she dropped her younger son off at the
school, Community Elementary School 90. ``But I told him it wasn't
right and that it was cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents like Ms. Wright said they often found themselves in the
uncomfortable position of having to teach their children that what
their teachers were doing was not right. On Tuesday, school
investigators accused 43 teachers, 2 principals and 2
paraprofessionals of giving answers on standardized tests to
students in 32 New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Brown, 35, a furniture mover whose son, James, is in
the third grade at CES 90, said he was deeply disturbed by the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that school is an extension of the home,'' Brown
said. ``Don't lie. Don't cheat. The morals you teach at home should
be carried over to the school setting. This is wrong that they are
teaching the kids the cheater's route. Firing the teachers is a
good step.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, parents said they were more shocked than surprised, given
the long history of neglect of the school and its Bronx district.
</P>
<P>
   CES 90 is on Sheridan Avenue, at Grand Central Concourse and
166th Street in Community School District 9, which has been racked
by scandal for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a windswept stretch of narrow sidewalk in front of
the school, several parents said Wednesday that they had always
suspected that cheating was going on, but had never tried to do
anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about this school surprises me,'' said Ms. Wright, who
was dropping off Raymond, 8. She acknowledged that she did not try
to report her suspicions two years ago. ``The last principal left
after he was accused of taking money from the school. There are
rodents in the cafeteria. Why not cheating?''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents said that the machinations at the school made it
difficult for them to assess how well their children were doing.
Daisy Diaz, 26, recalled how her daughter, Daisy Ferrer, 9, scored
above average on the citywide reading test in the third grade,
though she was just an average student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I help her with her homework,'' Ms. Diaz said. ``I wasn't
seeing what the test showed. It showed that she was a really smart,
above-average kid. She's just average.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Edward Stancik, the special investigator for New
York City schools, announced that the 47 educators had engaged in
systematic cheating to improve students' scores on citywide reading
and mathematics tests during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators found that some teachers and principals
allowed students to mark their answers on scrap or notebook paper,
then told them which answers to correct on the test booklet. Others
directed students to erase wrong answers, or even changed answers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew held a last-minute news conference
on Tuesday at which he pledged a thorough investigation and
announced that he had reassigned many of those involved to ``desk
duty.'' He played down differences that he and Stancik had had in
the past. Crew has accused Stancik of grandstanding, while Stancik
has accused him of being slow to act on problems.
</P>
<P>
   But in praising Stancik's findings, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
tiptoed around a potential squabble with Crew, with whom he has
been in conflict over education overhaul. At a news conference,
Giuliani declined to discuss how the findings might affect Crew,
who is trying to decide whether he wants to seek a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ed Stancik does very, very good work,'' the mayor
said. ``The board has to take this very seriously, and it can't be
in denial of it. They have to face up to it, make people
accountable and make sure it doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The report cited flagrant cheating in CES 90 and 88 in District
9 in the Bronx and Public School 234 in District 12 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began at CES 90 after a teacher, Stacey
Moscowitz, reported the school's practices to Stancik's office and
a television news reporter. Jon Nichols, a mathematics teacher, and
others came forward to support the accusations. Mrs. Moskowitz, who
started at the school in 1990, and Nichols, who started in 1993,
told investigators that the principal, Richard Wallin, coached them
to help students cheat. They did so, they said, under pressure to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Wallin was transferred to the District 9
offices because of an unrelated, unspecified disciplinary matter,
the report said. Later that year, the school's third-grade reading
scores dropped to 39.9 percent, from 66.7 percent the year before.
The school has students from kindergarten through fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, parents suggested that Wallin's transfer may have
been related to questionable spending practices. Several parents
said he might have spent money on an aquarium that was intended for
school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money was supposed to go for the kids, but he spent it on
animals, expensive aquarium fish, snakes and rabbits for his
office,'' said Madeline Vega, 27, the vice president of the
school's Parent-Teacher Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vega, whose daughter, Angelica, 9, is in the fourth grade,
said that she had heard reports of cheating for years, but that
nothing had ever been done because parents felt powerless. Many
said they thought their children were being shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to know anything,'' said Yvonne Gonzalez,
30, who was at the school to pick up her niece. ``What's going to
happen when the kids get to junior high and they can't read? They
were cheating the children out of their education.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Thomas, 33, knows the results firsthand. Several years
ago, she found out that one of her two grown daughters who had
attended the school was unable to read or write, she said. Now, her
5-year-old daughter, April, is enrolled at the school. She would
prefer to send her to a private school, but she cannot afford it,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my suspicions,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ``When I transferred
Cindy out of the school, she didn't have any records. The records
they did find were incomprehensible. You couldn't understand what
they wrote. They were passing her from grade to grade and she
couldn't read or write.''

CLINTON CAUTIONS RUSSIA IN YEAR'S FINAL NEWS SESSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton warned Russia on Wednesday it
risks alienation from the international community and investors
because of its military campaign against Chechnya but he refused to
suspend U.S. aid to punish Moscow for attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The president, hosting his final news conference of the year,
also said politics and threats should have no place in the
emotional debate over the fate of a 6-year-old Cuban boy found
clinging to an inner tube. Cuba and his father demand his return.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's session with reporters, held at the State Department's
Dean Acheson Auditorium, underscored his emphasis on international
issues. But, the president boasted of a number of domestic
accomplishments, despite beginning this year with a historic
impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cautioned Russia that it should not rely on the world's
desire to see it succeed, both economically and democratically, to
protect it from an international backlash caused by its punitive
Chechen policy.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow warned Chechen civilians this week to flee the capital of
Grozny by Saturday or face death. The Russia military wants to
destroy the Islamic rebels seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
   He said the continued military campaign and the resulting mass
of refugees ``will further alienate the global community from
Russia.'' He said that was bad because Russia needs support, not
just from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need investors. They need people to have confidence in
what they're doing. So there will be a heavy price there,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF suspended a $650 million loan installment to Russia but
based the decision, technically, on economic reasons. Clinton
raised the prospect that the Chechen conflict also could affect
Russia's loans. ``That's a bridge we'll have to cross when we get
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton placed foreign aid sanctions off the table,
noting Russia, as a member of the United Nations Security Council,
could veto any international effort. He said U.S. aid, about $600
million yearly, to Russia is dedicated to defusing and safeguarding
Moscow's nuclear weapons or supporting democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our interests would be furthered by terminating
that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cuba matter, the president was questioned about his
feelings and concerns over Elian Gonzalez and he repeatedly tried
to sidestep the emotional issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States should follow its legal process
to determine the fate of the boy, found in the ocean between Cuba
and Florida. His mother was among 11 people who drowned while
fleeing Cuba. President Fidel Castro and the boy's father are
demanding his return, but relatives in Florida and the Cuban
community want the youngster to remain in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says the United States' failure to immediately return Elian
to his father violates the spirit of accords signed to stop an
exodus of tens of thousands of Cubans in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that politics or threats should have anything to
do with it,'' Clinton said. He added that the boy's status was not
his decision to make; it was the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed a series of topics during the hour-long
session. They included:
</P>
<P>
   _ Defending his handling of the World Trade Organization session
in Seattle, predicting labor and environmental concerns backed by
the United States eventually will become a part of the WTO agenda.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saying the Housing and Urban Development's planned lawsuit
against gun manufacturers is not intended to drive the gun makers
from business but to make public housing safe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Naming Franklin D. Roosevelt as his nominee for ``man of the
century'' for the four-term president's handling of the nation's
affairs during the Depression and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   _ Praising Al Gore's decision to lessen his official role as
vice president in his quest for the Democratic nomination for
president.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reaffirming Panama's control over the Panama Canal and denying
conservatives' charges that a Hong Kong company that will operate
the ports could give China control over the critical waterway.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defending his record in hiring women and minorities for senior
positions. ``I have never not tried to recruit minorities for any
job that was open in the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stating that America's racial problems ``will stay at the
center of my concerns,'' even though he has yet to release the
report on race that he promised more than a year ago. He said he is
rewriting the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The president also backed the decision by the first lady to move
out of the White House and into their new New York home as she
prepares to run for the Senate. ``So she'll be up there a lot,
she'll be here when she can,'' Clinton said. ``I'll go up there
when I can. And we'll be together as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton was urged to run for the Senate after her
popularity soared during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. However,
she's expected to be in a difficult race against Republican Rudolph
Guiliani, the mayor of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's candidacy is another odd turn of events coming
out of the Lewinsky scandal. Clinton was impeached by the House for
lying to a grand jury about the affair and trying to cover it up.
Only the second president in history to be impeached, Clinton was
acquitted by the Senate in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton retains high job approval ratings from the public and he
listed many accomplishments for this year, including U.S. led
involvement in Kosovo, a 2000 budget that helps fund more teachers
and police, progress on peace in Ireland and the Middle East and
the curtailment of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

SPORTS COLUMN: RICHARDSON FINDS AN ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Micheal is CQ)  
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Micheal Ray Richardson's voice sounded light and upbeat. The
indomitable Sugar sounded happy as he spoke of life after then Europe. You could hear his 3-year-old daughter, Kimberly, and
Richardson's wife, Ilham, in the background. At 44, life is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great life here,'' he said. ``It's really laid back,
not a whole lot of crime. Not the drive-by shootings, not the drug
and alcohol problems. There is drugs and alcohol everywhere, but
over here it's safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson and his wife, a native of Morocco, have been together
for five years. They live in Antibes on the French Riviera, but he
plays in Italy with Livorno of the Italian League.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is heavier at 195 pounds, and plays 20 minutes a
game. He studies the National Basketball Association at a distance,
and is aware of players and their issues. He knows about Stephon
Marbury's travails with the Nets. ``Marbury is a great player,'' he
said, ``but you can't have a point guard shooting 25 or 30 times a
game and expect for your team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Richardson said he understands Marbury's
mind-set. ``As a young kid,'' he said, ``you don't want to hear
anything, so what you have to do. You have to take your bumps and
bruises. I took mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Richardson earned the distinction of being the first
player kicked out of the NBA under the provision of an anti-drug
agreement between the league and the players association. He
applied for readmittance in 1988 and was cleared in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the first guy out and the first guy in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But by then he was playing in Europe, and he never returned to
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after being banned, Richardson's tumultuous life
in the NBA is the subject of a documentary being produced by NBA
Entertainment for TNT.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the notion of having a documentary done on his
life, much less one produced by the NBA, seemed out of the
question. The idea came about in 1997, when Richardson saw NBA
commissioner David Stern in Paris at the McDonald's Open. At
intermission, he approached Stern, whom he had not seen since he
was kicked out of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if he thought I had bad feelings or what,''
Richardson said. ``But I walked up to him and I thanked him for
help saving my life. He was a part of it, because he made me open
up my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson hasn't seen any of the documentary, which will be
televised Feb. 16, but acknowledges that he never thought his life
would be the subject of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't,'' he said. ``Because of so many other
problems and issues in the world. I thought I was just another guy.
There were a lot of guys who went through the league who had
problems with drugs. I guess none of them with an ending like
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Few players have had a basketball life like his, beginning on
June 9, 1978, when the Knicks told stunned fans they had selected
an unknown player out of the University of Montana named Micheal
Ray Richardson. Richardson became one of the more exciting players
in Knick history.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was magic in the pros, even before Magic got there.
He was a point guard shooting guard small forward. His style was
distinguished by kamikaze-like drives tempered by good outside
shooting and passing.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also marked the transition between the old NBA _ a
league in which African-American players were becoming the
overwhelming majority, while at the same time fighting the image of
a league infested by drugs _ and the sleeker, cleaner NBA image
represented by Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Richardson was a star
who became an addict, part of a lost generation of players who
performed on the NBA's high wire before there was a net. Richardson
ran the fast break into an abyss of every imaginable excess. ``I
was like a kid in a candy store,'' he said. ``I guess I was really
too young; I hadn't really matured yet. It takes different people
different time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final season with the Knicks, when they were going bad
and there were rumors he would be traded, Richardson told a
reporter that ``the ship be sinkin'.'' The phrase became part of an
underground nomenclature in New York sports to describe disaster.
The phrase easily described Richardson's personal life. What
happened to his career is what happens with cocaine: intense, high
highs, followed by sharp lows.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said his drug problems began in 1982, after he was
traded to Golden State for Bernard King. ``I just couldn't deal
with it,'' he said. ``I had never used drugs when I was with the
Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was traded to the Nets in 1983. The trade set the
stage for a very public four-year war with cocaine. He was
suspended, reinstated, suspended, reinstated. Each time brought
pronouncements of being cured.
</P>
<P>
   From 1983 to 1986, when he was banned from the league,
Richardson was living the addict's life: jiving, lying, conniving.
``It took me five or six years to come to grips that it really was
a problem,'' he said, referring to his drug use. ``It's really
difficult for someone to understand it if you've never experienced
it. In life, everybody has problems of some kind. My problems at
the time was drugs. After a while, I accepted that. And I guess
that's why I'm doing so well, because I finally realized that there
was something in the world that was stronger than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his problem, he said, was that he felt invincible. He
was a three-time All-Star and two-time member of the league's
all-defensive squad, but he said: ``It's like I was `there,' I
couldn't get any higher. I couldn't move up any more. At the time,
I was really content.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Richardson reapplied for readmission. That same year he
followed Bob Hill, a Knicks assistant when he played with the team,
to Italy where they won the Italian Cup. Hill returned to coach
again in the NBA, Richardson stayed. He felt roots. He felt
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he finds himself thinking, more often than he likes,
``What if?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I had time to get myself together,'' he said. ``But
sometimes I sit and think and wonder, `Where would I be if I never
would have got involved in drugs?'''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Who cares? The ship is afloat.  &QL;

FINAL BIDS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR SALE OF JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Final bids to acquire the New York Jets were
submitted Wednesday to Goldman, Sachs, but the investment banking
firm for the Leon Hess estate did not release the names of the
potential buyers or their offers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Grubman, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs, confirmed
the deadline for the bids and said, ``It's very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidders include Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision,
Robert Wood Johnson IV, an heir to the Johnson &AMP; Johnson fortune,
and Sam Grossman, a Phoenix real estate developer, who bid
unsuccessfully for the Washington Redskins. John McMullen, the New
Jersey Devils' owner, is believed to be Dolan's minority partner.
Stephen M. Ross, a New York developer, was also expected to bid.
</P>
<P>
   The opening round of bidding two months ago narrowed the field
of suitors and brought preliminary indications above $510 million.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is expected to be the fiercest between Dolan,
whose company is the majority owner of Madison Square Garden, and
Johnson, who is active in fund-raising for the Republican Party and
the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Grubman was unwilling to comment on how long it will take to
declare a winner. If the process follows a typical course, Goldman,
Sachs, will analyze the bids and their financing, and could pick a
winner quickly if one greatly exceeds the others.
</P>
<P>
   If two or three are close together, the firm will probably try
to negotiate the bids higher and hope that one separates itself
from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the process, the investment banking firm will consult
with John Hess, the son of the late Jets' owner, and the other
executors of his father's estate. Ultimately, the winning bid
requires the approval of the National Football League's finance
committee and a three-quarters vote of its full ownership. &QL;

DISCOVERY LAUNCH PUT ON HOLD AGAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA has delayed for at least one day the
launch of the shuttle Discovery on a mission to the Hubble Space
Telescope so that engineers can assess damage to a dented fuel
line.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery and a crew of seven had been scheduled to lift off at
11:42 p.m. EST Saturday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   If the 6-foot section of line must be replaced, the liftoff will
be delayed by several days, said NASA's Joel Wells, a shuttle
program spokesman. A decision on how long to delay the planned
10-day flight was expected Thursday after an engineering analysis
of the damage, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's countdown was to begin early Thursday, but those
activities were postponed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers have said they want Discovery back on the
ground by Dec. 27 to avoid potential Y2K surprises. If the launch
does not occur by Tuesday, shuttle managers would consider
shortening the planned 10-day flight, but no liftoff is planned
beyond Dec. 17, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew plans four lengthy spacewalks to replace the
Hubble's failing gyroscopes and make other repairs. Astronomers
were forced to halt Hubble observations last month after four
gyros, crucial components of the telescope's pointing system,
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The dented fuel line is the latest in a series of difficulties
that have led to postponements since the initial launch plan of
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is to a line that recirculates supercold liquid
hydrogen between the shuttle's three rocket engines and its large
external fuel tank prior to liftoff. It was discovered by
technicians working in Discovery's engine compartment early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As they removed a protective covering called ``elephant wrap,''
technicians found a 12-inch-long, half-inch deep dent in the metal
line. The 4-inch-wide vacuum conduit includes a fuel line and an
outer sleeve that insulates the chilled fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are assessing whether the dented outer sleeve would
hamper the insulation, Wells said. X-ray examinations and other
evaluations revealed no cracks in the line.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the damage is unclear, but it could have been
caused by a worker inadvertently stepping on the line, said Jack
King, a spokesman for the United Space Alliance, NASA's shuttle
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   King said workers must wear protective headgear and clothing
because of the toxic fuels in the shuttle's cramped engine
compartment, making it difficult for them to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency suspended all shuttle missions after the
shuttle Columbia experienced an electrical short during liftoff in
July. When the short was traced to wiring with damaged insulation,
shuttle managers ordered inspections and repairs to each of the
winged space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery required 57 repairs to the insulation on internal
wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Additional delays were announced because NASA decided to replace
a rocket engine containing a half-inch-long broken drill bit;
inspect and repair a bundle of wires linking the shuttle and its
fuel tank; replace a data cable linking the fuel tank and the solid
rocket boosters; and replace a wire harness linking a rocket engine
and its computerlike controller.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIMA, Peru _ If you are ``between Pisco and Nazca,'' according
to an old Peruvian saying, you are happily inebriated. And in the
small coastal town of Ica, which lies geographically between Pisco
and Nazca, its inhabitants are frequently to be discovered in the
state that the saying describes.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in the area who has a plot of land and a vine makes
his own pisco,'' Felix, the bartender at Ica's up-market Las Dunas
hotel, says as he mixes cocktails made with the liquor, a colorless
grape brandy, for visitors. ``People still tread the grapes and
make it as they have done for centuries. And when there is anything
to celebrate _ and that's quite often hereabouts _ out it comes.''
 &HT;    Felix is mixing Peru's national drink, the pisco sour. He does
it with panache, not bothering much to measure quantities. The
recipe is not complex: three parts pisco, two parts sugar syrup and
one part freshly squeezed key lime juice. Into the blender it goes,
with plenty of ice and some egg white. A quick whiz and Felix is
pouring out the frothy mixture and shaking a little ground cinnamon
on top. ``Delicious,'' the tourists respond. ``That's how
foreigners like it,'' Felix says. ``Peruvians usually prefer it
drier, with only one part syrup.''
 &HT;    Despite its popularity inside Peru, pisco is little known
abroad. That is hardly surprising, given that only a 10th of the
8,400 hectares devoted to grape-growing in Peru produce the
varieties from which pisco is made. Annual production is some 1.2
million liters, and a large percentage of that is the ``informal''
pisco made in the Ica and Moquegua valleys, which never gets more
than a few miles from where it is produced. Exports have rarely
topped $250,000 a year.
 &HT;    Still, Peru's Export Promotion Commission (Prompex) is
campaigning to get pisco better known. ``It's the product that,
above all others, reflects Peru and its history,'' says Fernando
Ego-Aguirre, who looks after pisco and other niche exports for
Promex and is also head of the National Pisco Commission.
 &HT;    Pisco was born in the desert coastal region south of Lima, where
the Paracas culture _ famed for its extraordinarily fine textiles _
flourished between 300 B.C and 200 A.D. Although the area looks
depressingly barren except where it is crossed by rivers running
down from the high Andes to the east, the ancient civilizations
mastered the art of irrigation, channeling the precious water so
that barely a drop was wasted. In the Ica area, a wide variety of
plants and fruits flourished. When the Spanish conquerors arrived
in the area in the 16th century, they discovered ideal conditions
for planting the vines they had brought from the Canary Islands.
 &HT;    The origins of the name have nothing to do with alcohol. In
Quechua, ``pisscu'' means a small bird. The name was bestowed to
the oasis-like plains where condors and other mountain birds
stopped to rest between the high Andes and the Pacific Ocean in
search of food. Skilled potters living in the area were also known
as ``piscos.'' They fashioned containers made of adobe, or baked
mud, used to ferment a variety of alcoholic beverages. As the years
passed, ``pisco'' came to be used to designate either the drinking
vessels, the people who made them o their contents.
 &HT;    Somewhat confusingly, Pisco is also the name of the port from
which the grape brandy was shipped. Today, it is a rather
unprepossessing town surrounded by fish meal-processing plants. But
it appears on maps that date back to the late 16th century. During
the 17th and 18th centuries, few Spanish ships sailed from Pisco
without large consignments of the sweet-tasting but potent brandy
on board. Historical records show that much was exported along the
Pacific seaboard to Valparaiso to the south and Guayaquil to the
north, as well as to Spain.
 &HT;    The oldest mention of pisco is found in 1613, when historian
Lorenzo Huertas wrote of a will in which a master bequeathed to his
slave ``vats full of brandy and a large copper cauldron'' in which
she could prepare it. In 1630, Spanish chronicler Francisco Lopez
de Caravantes called pisco ``one of the most exquisite liquors that
can be drunk in the entire world.''
 &HT;    Today, surprisingly little has changed about the way it is made.
In a simple, rustic process, the grapes are pressed and the fresh
juice is heated until it evaporates, then cooled. Water is never
added to dilute it. The resulting ``brandy'' is transparent or
slightly amber in color with a pure alcohol content of between 38
degrees and 46 degrees proof.
 &HT;    Varieties are classified by their taste, rather than their
scent. There is pure pisco, generally favored by pisco connoisseurs
and made from the Quebranta grape, a non-aromatic variety that is
the result of genetic mutations of the ordinary black grape
introduced by the Spaniards. Then there is the aromatic pisco made
from grapes such as Italia, Torontel and Moscatel, which has a
distinctive scent. Pisco acholado is made from a blend of
varieties, both aromatic and Quebranta. Finally, ``green'' pisco is
made from only partially fermented juices. Locals like to vary
their pisco diet by flavoring it with local fruits, including fig,
mango, cherry, lemon or chirimoya (custard apple).
 &HT;    The Ica valley is home to one of Peru's best-known ``formal''
producers of pisco: Tacama. Set in 150 hectares of vineyards, the
offices of the 100-year-old wine- and pisco-producing and exporting
company are housed in the tranquil setting of a former colonial
convent, complete with chapel and ancient bell tower.
 &HT;    By contrast, Tacama's production facilities are state-of-the
art. The hacienda _ much smaller today than prior to the 1973 land
``reform'' _ produces Peru's best-known wines (some of which are
exported) and, on a much smaller scale, two brands of pisco: pure
and acholado, the latter under the trademark El Demonio de los
Andes (The Devil of the Andes).
 &HT;    Production methods have changed little. Pisco still involves
copper cauldrons and the traditional shape of the alambique, or
still, has not changed in centuries. But in a concession to
modernity, once fermentation and evaporation are complete and the
brandy is distilled, it is stored in vats made of concrete,
replacing the traditional, more romantic adobe botijas (vats).
 &HT;    ``It's the same system as in colonial times,'' says Robert
Niederman, Tacama's French-born enologist. ``We cannot modernize:
Peruvian norms do not allow it.''
 &HT;    Tacama produces between 5,000 and 6,000 cases of pisco a year,
most of which goes for internal consumption. Export promotion
efforts, Niederman says, have brought few results to date. ``It
requires a great deal of care,'' he warns. ``It would be disastrous
to enter the international market with a substandard product, and
there are very few pisco producers today who can absolutely
guarantee a legitimate, quality product.'' Still, pisco promoters
are going to try.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIMA, Peru _ En Peru, cuando una persona bebe y se pone alegre,
se dice que esta entre Pisco y Nazca. Y en el pequeno pueblo
costero de Ica, que geograficamente se encuentra entre Pisco y
Nazca, sus habitantes con frecuencia suelen alcanzar esas alturas.
 &HT;    ``Todos los habitantes de la zona que tienen un terreno y un
vinedo hacen su propio pisco,'' explica Felix, camarero del lujoso
hotel Las Dunas, de Ica, mientras prepara pisco sour para los
visitantes. ``La gente todavia prensa las uvas para hacer el pisco,
como hace siglos. Y cuando hay algo que celebrar, y aqui hay muchas
celebraciones, se brinda con pisco.''
 &HT;    Felix se dedica a preparar la bebida nacional de Peru, el pisco
sour. Lo hace con gran soltura, sin prestar mucha atencion a las
medidas. La receta no es complicada: tres partes de pisco, dos de
almibar y una de jugo de limon. Todo se pone en la mezcladora, con
mucho hielo y clara de huevo. Despues de batirla, Felix le echa un
poco de canela. ``Delicioso,'' responden los turistas. ``Asi es
como les gusta a los extranjeros,'' dice Felix. ``A los peruanos
les gusta mas seco, solo con el almibar.''
 &HT;    A pesar de su popularidad en Peru, en otros paises apenas se
conoce el pisco, lo que no extrana si se tiene en cuenta que solo
la decima parte de las 8.400 hectareas dedicadas al cultivo de la
uva en Peru producen las variedades con las que se hace el pisco.
La produccion anual es de unos 1,2 millones de litros, y un gran
porcentaje de esa cifra es el pisco ``informal'' elaborado en los
valles de Ica y Moquegua, que nunca llega muy lejos del lugar donde
se produce. Las exportaciones rara vez han superado los US$25.000
anuales.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, la Comision de Promocion de Exportaciones de Peru
(Promex) se esfuerza por popularizar el pisco. ``Es el producto que
refleja a Peru y a su historia mejor que cualquier otro,'' dice
Fernando Ego-Aguirre, que esta a cargo del pisco y de otras
exportaciones especiales en Promex y que tambien dirige la Comision
Nacional del Pisco.
 &HT;    El pisco surgio en la desertica region costera al sur de Lima
donde la cultura de Paracas, famosa por sus finos productos
textiles, florecio entre el ano 300 a.C. y el 200 d.C. Aunque la
zona parece desolada, excepto en las partes donde la cruzan rios
que bajan de los Andes, las civilizaciones antiguas dominaron el
arte de la irrigacion y canalizaron el agua de forma tal que no se
perdiera ni una gota. En la zona de Ica se daba una gran variedad
de plantas y frutas. Cuando los conquistadores espanoles llegaron
en el siglo XVI, hallaron condiciones ideales para plantar las
vides que habian traido de las islas Canarias.
 &HT;    El origen del nombre no tiene nada que ver con el alcohol. En
quechua, ``pisscu'' es el nombre de un pajaro pequeno. El nombre se
dio a los llanos tipo oasis donde los condores y otras aves de la
cordillera se detenian para descansar en su viaje entre los Andes y
el oceano Pacifico, en busca de comida. A los habiles alfareros que
vivian en la region tambien se les llamaba ``piscos.'' Elaboraban
recipientes de adobe, donde ponian a fermentar bebidas alcoholicas.
Al paso de los anos, se uso el sustantivo ``pisco'' para designar a
los recipientes, a los individuos que los fabricaban y a su
contenido.
 &HT;    Para mas confusion, Pisco tambien es el nombre del puerto donde
se embarcaba el aguardiente. Hoy, es un pueblo feo rodeado por
fabricas de harina de pescado. Pero ya a fines del siglo XVI
aparecia en los mapas. En los dos siglos siguientes, varios barcos
espanoles zarparon de Pisco con grandes cargamentos del dulce y
vigoroso licor. Los archivos muestran que una gran cantidad de
pisco se exporto hacia Valparaiso, al sur, y a Guayaquil, al norte,
y tambien a Espana.
 &HT;    La mencion mas antigua que se hace del pisco data de 1613,
cuando el historiador Lorenzo Huertas escribio sobre un testamento
en el que un individuo legaba a su esclavo ``botijas de vurney
llenas de aguardiente, mas una caldera grande'' en la cual la mujer
podia prepararlo. En 1630, el cronista espanol Francisco Lopez de
Caravantes llamo al pisco ``uno de los licores mas exquisitos que
se bebe en el mundo entero.''
 &HT;    Es sorprendente que la forma de hacer el pisco haya cambiado tan
poco. El proceso es sencillo y rustico. Las uvas se prensan y el
zumo se calienta hasta que se evapora, y despues se enfria. Nunca
se echa agua para diluirlo. El aguardiente que resulta es
transparente o tiene un ligero color ambar, con un contenido de
alcohol entre 38 y 46 grados.
 &HT;    Las variedades se clasifican por el sabor, no por el aroma. Esta
el pisco puro, generalmente preferido por los conocedores y
elaborado a partir de la uva quebranta, una variedad no aromatica,
resultado de mutaciones geneticas de la uva negra comun que
trajeron los espanoles. Esta tambien el pisco aromatico, hecho de
uvas como la Italia, la torontel y la moscatel, que tiene un aroma
distintivo. El pisco acholado se hace de una mezcla de variedades,
tanto aromaticas como Quebranta. Por ultimo, el pisco ``verde'' se
fabrica a partir de jugos solo fermentados en parte. A los
lugarenos les gusta variar el sabor del pisco con frutas de la
comarca, como higos, mangos, cerezas, limones y chirimoyas.
 &HT;    En el valle de Ica esta uno de los productores de pisco mas
conocidos de Peru: Tacama, que abarca 150 hectareas de vinedos. Las
oficinas de la compania productora y exportadora de vino y de
pisco, fundada hace 100 anos, estan en lo que era un apacible
convento colonial, con capilla y campanario.
 &HT;    En cambio, las instalaciones de produccion de Tacama son
modernisimas. La hacienda (mucho mas pequena hoy que antes de la
reforma agraria de 1973) produce los vinos mas famosos de Peru,
varios de los cuales se exportan, y, en escala mucho menor, dos
variedades de pisco: el puro y el acholado, este ultimo bajo la
marca comercial El Demonio de los Andes.
 &HT;    Los metodos de produccion han cambiado poco. Todavia hay que
usar calderos de cobre y la forma tradicional del alambique no ha
cambiado nada en siglos. Pero en una concesion a la modernidad,
cuando se completan la fermentacion y la evaporacion y se destila
el aguardiente, se almacena en recipientes fabricados de cemento,
que han sustituido a las botijas de adobe, mas tradicionales y
romanticas.
 &HT;    ``Es el mismo sistema que en los tiempos coloniales,'' dice
Robert Niederman, enologo de Tacama, nacido en Francia. ``No
podemos modernizarnos: las normas peruanas no lo permiten.'' Tacama
produce entre 5.000 y 6.000 cajas de pisco al ano, y una gran parte
se destina al consumo interno. Los esfuerzos por promocionar las
exportaciones, dice Niederman, no han dado grandes resultados.
``Hay que hacerlo con mucho cuidado,'' advierte. ``Seria desastroso
entrar en el mercado internacional con un producto por debajo del
estandar, y hay pocos productores de pisco que garanticen un
producto legitimo y de calidad.'' De todos modos, los promotores
del pisco lo van a intentar.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIMA, Peru _ En Peru, cuando una persona bebe y se pone alegre,
se dice que esta entre Pisco y Nazca. Y en el pequeno pueblo
costero de Ica, que geograficamente se encuentra entre Pisco y
Nazca, sus habitantes con frecuencia suelen alcanzar esas alturas.
 &HT;    ``Todos los habitantes de la zona que tienen un terreno y un
vinedo hacen su propio pisco,'' explica Felix, camarero del lujoso
hotel Las Dunas, de Ica, mientras prepara pisco sour para los
visitantes. ``La gente todavia prensa las uvas para hacer el pisco,
como hace siglos. Y cuando hay algo que celebrar, y aqui hay muchas
celebraciones, se brinda con pisco.''
 &HT;    Felix se dedica a preparar la bebida nacional de Peru, el pisco
sour. Lo hace con gran soltura, sin prestar mucha atencion a las
medidas. La receta no es complicada: tres partes de pisco, dos de
almibar y una de jugo de limon. Todo se pone en la mezcladora, con
mucho hielo y clara de huevo. Despues de batirla, Felix le echa un
poco de canela. ``Delicioso,'' responden los turistas. ``Asi es
como les gusta a los extranjeros,'' dice Felix. ``A los peruanos
les gusta mas seco, solo con el almibar.''
 &HT;    A pesar de su popularidad en Peru, en otros paises apenas se
conoce el pisco, lo que no extrana si se tiene en cuenta que solo
la decima parte de las 8.400 hectareas dedicadas al cultivo de la
uva en Peru producen las variedades con las que se hace el pisco.
La produccion anual es de unos 1,2 millones de litros, y un gran
porcentaje de esa cifra es el pisco ``informal'' elaborado en los
valles de Ica y Moquegua, que nunca llega muy lejos del lugar donde
se produce. Las exportaciones rara vez han superado los US$25.000
anuales.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, la Comision de Promocion de Exportaciones de Peru
(Promex) se esfuerza por popularizar el pisco. ``Es el producto que
refleja a Peru y a su historia mejor que cualquier otro,'' dice
Fernando Ego-Aguirre, que esta a cargo del pisco y de otras
exportaciones especiales en Promex y que tambien dirige la Comision
Nacional del Pisco.
 &HT;    El pisco surgio en la desertica region costera al sur de Lima
donde la cultura de Paracas, famosa por sus finos productos
textiles, florecio entre el ano 300 a.C. y el 200 d.C. Aunque la
zona parece desolada, excepto en las partes donde la cruzan rios
que bajan de los Andes, las civilizaciones antiguas dominaron el
arte de la irrigacion y canalizaron el agua de forma tal que no se
perdiera ni una gota. En la zona de Ica se daba una gran variedad
de plantas y frutas. Cuando los conquistadores espanoles llegaron
en el siglo XVI, hallaron condiciones ideales para plantar las
vides que habian traido de las islas Canarias.
 &HT;    El origen del nombre no tiene nada que ver con el alcohol. En
quechua, ``pisscu'' es el nombre de un pajaro pequeno. El nombre se
dio a los llanos tipo oasis donde los condores y otras aves de la
cordillera se detenian para descansar en su viaje entre los Andes y
el oceano Pacifico, en busca de comida. A los habiles alfareros que
vivian en la region tambien se les llamaba ``piscos.'' Elaboraban
recipientes de adobe, donde ponian a fermentar bebidas alcoholicas.
Al paso de los anos, se uso el sustantivo ``pisco'' para designar a
los recipientes, a los individuos que los fabricaban y a su
contenido.
 &HT;    Para mas confusion, Pisco tambien es el nombre del puerto donde
se embarcaba el aguardiente. Hoy, es un pueblo feo rodeado por
fabricas de harina de pescado. Pero ya a fines del siglo XVI
aparecia en los mapas. En los dos siglos siguientes, varios barcos
espanoles zarparon de Pisco con grandes cargamentos del dulce y
vigoroso licor. Los archivos muestran que una gran cantidad de
pisco se exporto hacia Valparaiso, al sur, y a Guayaquil, al norte,
y tambien a Espana.
 &HT;    La mencion mas antigua que se hace del pisco data de 1613,

SENATOR CALLS FOR PROBE OF OIL FIRMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  NORTH HOLLYWOOD - Describing California consumers and gas
station owners as victims, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Wednesday
called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the state's
big oil companies and to meet with local gas station owners who
believe those companies are trying to drive them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in front of a North Hollywood gas station,
Boxer, surrounded by independent gas station owners, accused Shell
and other major oil companies of conducting a
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also accused oil companies of wanting to take over the
stations operated by franchisees so they could control prices all
the way from the oil fields to the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost two years independent service station operators in
California have been punished for fighting for price fairness for
their customers,'' said Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the big oil companies can't fire their franchisees,
which would violate their contract, they are using a variety of
tactics to increase costs and harass and intimidate their own
franchisees,'' the senator said. ``The big oil companies want these
good people to stay quiet, and if they don't stay quiet they are
driving them out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Corp. Fred Gorell described Boxer's claim of harassment
as totally false: ``We encourage our dealers to speak their minds
on any subject, including gas prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many investigations into gas prices and
consistently they find it is the marketplace at work for any price
increase or decrease,'' said Gorell.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Shell and Equilon did not return messages
requesting any comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fred Dagher, who operates eight Shell stations in
the San Gabriel Valley, since the Shell/Texaco merger in 1998
created Equilon, ``they have made it harder for me to stay in
business.'' Equilon controls the refining and distribution of
gasoline for Shell and Texaco in the western United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken away our rebate programs, our rent has tripled
and they have increased the price that dealers pay for gas, leaving
owners in a position where they can't pass on price cuts to the
consumer,'' said Dagher.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Frio, who operates a Chevron station near Los Angeles
International Airport, said independent operators ''
</P>
<P>
   One of the gas stations at the intersection of Camarillo Street,
Riverside Drive and Tujunga Avenue, which served as the site for
the Boxer news conference, was a Shell station selling unleaded
gasoline for $1.35 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Souheil Bisharart, who was forced to sell his two Shell stations
in Pasadena and Arcadia last year, said if the harassment of
independent dealers continues, both the San Gabriel and the San
Fernando valleys will continue to lose independent gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky, Boxer said
independently owned, branded service stations have long been a
mainstay of California's gasoline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition I ask that you meet with a delegation of
independent service station operators ... so you can hear their
concerns first-hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who asked the FTC to investigate anti-competitive oil
company practices in California in March last year, said she hoped
the government's investigation would be concluded by the end of the
year.

RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT IN WASHINGTON HELD IN SPY CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story is an added starter on The New York Times front
page) 
 (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal authorities Wednesday night arrested a
Russian diplomat believed to be an intelligence officer who had
sought classified information from the State Department, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not identify the diplomat, but they said
that the case involved a substantial Russian espionage effort aimed
at pilfering sensitive information about American activities
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the arrest followed a
counterintelligence investigation and that it would be announced on
Thursday. The Russian diplomat, who was employed at Moscow's
embassy in Washington, was arrested in the Washington area, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The official, detained while carrying an electronic listening
device used to detect surveillance, has immunity as a diplomat and
is expected to assert this to avoid prosecution in the United
States, the American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the arrest seemed to link it to an incident in
Moscow on Nov. 30, when the Russian authorities detained an
American diplomat who they said was a spy preparing to meet a
Russian contact.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials said that the arrest Wednesday night was
not intended as retaliation for that detention, but rather
represented the culmination of an investigation by the FBI and
other agencies that had begun before the Moscow incident.
</P>
<P>
   Former American intelligence officials familiar with
counterespionage cases said that the FBI and CIA have tended not to
engage in such retaliatory measures, at least in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that any Americans were detained
Wednesday night, suggesting that FBI counterintelligence agents may
have lured the Russian to a clandestine meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of a Russian official was highly unusual. While the
practice was common at the height of the the Cold War, in recent
years the diplomatic expulsions have declined. The State Department
made no comment Wednesday night on the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The last Russian diplomat expelled from the United States was
ordered out of the country in 1994 a week after the arrest of
Aldrich H. Ames, the CIA officer who was later convicted of spying
for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the arrest appeared certain to further strain the
already uneasy relationship between the two countries, already at
odds over Russia's offensive against its rebellious province of
Chechnya and the U.S. plan to erect a limited anti-missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the significance
of espionage between the United States and Russia has declined
along with Moscow's reduced global importance. Yet each country
still actively collects intelligence about its former adversary and
pursues investigations of alleged penetrations.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA continues to operate an intelligence station at the
American Embassy in Moscow, and the Russians have long conducted a
similar operation from their embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and CIA officials have frequently complained, in fact, that
the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service that is the
successor to the Soviet KGB, has maintained a large presence in
Washington throughout the 1990s. Earlier this year, Clinton
administration officials complained to Moscow that there were too
many spies in the Russian Embassy here and demanded that the levels
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has also exploited the disintegration of the Soviet
Union to expand beyond Moscow and open stations in many of the
newly independent states that were once Soviet republics. In some
of those countries, the agency has established strong relationships
with the local intelligence services as well.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the American authorities have investigated a
number of cases of Russian espionage, but most have stemmed from
instances in which Americans, often motivated by money, had
volunteered to spy for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious case to emerge in the post-Cold War era was
that of Ames, the CIA officer who was arrested in February 1994. He
was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for spying for
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Ames, a career counterintelligence officer, turned over to his
Russian handlers the identities of a number of Russian and East
European agents who were secretly supplying information to the
United States. Ames was paid nearly $2 million for his information.
More than a dozen of the agents identified by Ames were executed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the arrest in Moscow last week, the Russians
identified the American espionage suspect as Cheri Leberknight and
said she was a CIA officer who had been working undercover as a
secretary at the American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   When she was detained in Moscow, the Russian authorities accused
her of trying to obtain secret Russian military documents. They
said she carried a map and a number of devices designed to detect
whether she was under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   After being detained, she was released to American Embassy
officials because she had diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest Wednesday night is the latest in a series of recent
spy incidents, confirming that espionage did not die with the end
of the Cold War. Earlier this year, Germany's internal security
service reportedly forced the CIA to withdraw three of its officers
from Germany, in a sign that German authorities want the agency to
scale back its operations on their soil.

EDITORIAL: TWO STEPS FORWARD IN THE MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Mideast peacemaking quickened this week, improving
the chances that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak can meet his
ambitious goal of negotiating agreements with the Palestinians and
Syria within the next year. On Monday Barak wisely removed a major
obstacle to progress with the Palestinians by temporarily freezing
most new construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Then,
Wednesday, President Clinton announced that direct peace talks
between Israel and Syria would resume in Washington next week,
picking up where they broke off in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The issues to be resolved with Syria _ withdrawal in the Golan
Heights, security guarantees for Israel and the establishment of
normal relations _ are somewhat more straightforward than those
dividing Israel and the Palestinians. Hard negotiating lies ahead.
But one of the biggest difficulties had been getting the two sides
to speak to each other again, and that now appears to have been
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement freeze brings Israel close to the ``time-out'' on
settlement construction long urged by Washington. Construction of
completely new settlements was suspended several years ago. Now
most expansion of existing settlements will be halted as well. What
is still unclear is whether Barak's new freeze will be extended to
include projects that have already been approved but where
construction has not yet begun. It would be best if these were also
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   There are now some 200,000 Jewish settlers and nearly two
million Palestinians in the West Bank. Barak has tried to steer
between pressures from settlers and the demands of Palestinian
negotiators. Broad Israeli support is needed for any eventual peace
agreement. But the settlers cannot have a veto over Israel's
policies. Barak has assured the settlers that many of their
communities will remain under Israeli sovereignty after a peace
agreement. In light of that promise, it is reasonable for the
Palestinians to ask that settlements not be expanded while the
agreement is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barak took office in July he has authorized new housing in
settlements at a faster pace than his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu. Just last week 500 new housing units were approved. All
these permits were granted for the stated purpose of accommodating
population growth within settler communities. Those expansion needs
have been met. Priority must now go to creating the best atmosphere
for peacemaking by declaring a total freeze on settlement
construction.

   (UNDATED) You hit your minimize button to hide your Internet
window. You turn your computer screen to be less visible to
passers-by. You can't remember when you last wrote a letter from
home.
</P>
<P>
   You have a Web-linked computer at work.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like the majority of employees surveyed in September
by Vault.com, a career information and company gossip Internet
site, you spend a lot of work time online.
</P>
<P>
   Only about one in 10 of the 1,244 workers surveyed said that Web
surfing for nonwork reasons was unethical and that they didn't do
it. More than one-third said they surfed ``constantly.'' More than
half admitted surfing more than 30 minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 percent said they never sent personal e-mails from work.
The rest admitted sending and receiving from one to more than 20
nonwork messages a day.
</P>
<P>
   About three-fourths said they didn't take special measures to
avoid detection nor had they been caught. Fifty-six percent
acknowledged that Net time decreased their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Vault.com also queried a similar number of employers (1,438) for
the company perspective. Bosses see that the Internet is here to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 percent of the employers said 30 minutes or more a day
online was permissible; 4.2 percent of them condoned more than an
hour, citing stress relief and ``balancing life's needs'' as
reasons for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Same with personal e-mailing. All but 14 percent of employers
said sending nonwork e-mails from work was permissible.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that managers are too busy to police personal
computer use. Whatever the reason, only about half said they had
``caught'' an employee online; only half said worker productivity
was hurt by nonwork surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the statistics are opinions. For example: Do employers
have the right to monitor employee Internet use?
</P>
<P>
   Some employees and employers say no, a company has no right to
open a postal envelope addressed to a recipient, so neither should
e-mails be fair game. Others say it's the company dime _ equipment,
Internet access and time _ so, yes, the employer has the right to
control use.
</P>
<P>
   And what about control of content? Do employers have the right
to punish a worker who has e-mail or opens a Web page with content
someone else finds objectionable?
</P>
<P>
   Some employees and employers alike say yes, of course _ the
workplace must protect workers from offensive exposure that could
be classified as discrimination or harassment. Others say no _
controlling access threatens freedom of speech and rights of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The universal conclusion is that the Internet consumes work
time. Seven out of 10 employers know it but still don't have
policies to monitor or restrict it. It's hard to know if they're
ignoring the issue, don't care about it or haven't had time to
address it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, employees who surf on company time and equipment
should remember that employers can trace their activity. Success in
the cyberspace work world may not require you to watch your back,
but rather watch your tracks.

MEDICARE FRAUD CASE IS SETTLED FOR $74 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ One of Connecticut's largest health care
providers has agreed to pay $74 million for distributing millions
of dollars in unnecessary Medicare payments to hospitals in the
late 1980s and early '90s, federal investigators announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The amount represents the largest fraud settlement related to
health care in the state's history, they said, and is the
second-largest fraud settlement in the country involving a Medicare
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the civil settlement, the provider,
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut, will pay the
government $41.8 million within 10 days, said U.S. Attorney Stephen
Robinson, speaking to reporters from his offices in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $32.4 million of the settlement represents the
amount of illegal overpayments Blue Cross officials made to fewer
than 10 hospitals around the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous amount of excessive payments was a complicated
combination of miscalculation and, later, blatant cover-up by Blue
Cross officials, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   This is how prosecutors said the scheme worked: Between 1989 and
1991, Blue Cross inadvertently overpaid some hospitals their share
of Medicare expenses. But rather than ask for that money back, the
company altered its accounting records to make it appear as though
it had actually underpaid those hospitals. Then, to cover up the
mistaken overpayments, Blue Cross knowingly overpaid other
hospitals it had initially underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the intentional overpayments to some hospitals
eventually matched the amount of inadvertent overpayments to other
hospitals. In the end, the company's books appeared to be balanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated, what they did,'' Robinson said, ``but it was
all with an intent to have the books and records be balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Blue Cross overpaid and covered up $32.4 million
over three years to preserve its $3.5 million annual contract with
the Federal Health Care Finance Administration, which rates how
accurate health care companies are in delivering Medicare payments
to hospitals nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money does not become as important as the evaluation,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hughes, explaining the company's
reasoning for the overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Blue Cross was administering about $450
million dollars in Medicare payments a year statewide, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The excessive payments, both mistaken and intentional, did not
go unnoticed by many hospital administrations that received them,
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some level of understanding that it did not belong
to them,'' Robinson said of the excess money. Some hospitals placed
the extra money in savings accounts and neither spent nor reported
it; other hospitals reported the excessive payments to ``various
individuals,'' he said, but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the illegal payments escaped notice by auditors at
the Health Care Finance Administration and by federal prosecutors.
Prosecutors did not learn of the scheme until July 1998, seven
years after the payments were made.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have already recovered about $25 million of
the $32.4 million in unwarranted payments, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company that made the illegal payments was Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Connecticut, which merged in August 1997 with Anthem
Health Plans of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants for the resulting company, Anthem Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Connecticut, discovered the payment scheme in May
1998 and started an internal investigation, said Jim Parker, a
company spokesman. Around that same time, federal prosecutors began
their investigation, Robinson said.

FARMLAND STILL OPEN TO CENEX MERGER, MEMBERS TOLD AT ANNUAL
MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The ``door is still open'' for a merger of
Farmland Industries Inc. and Minnesota-based Cenex Harvest States
Cooperatives, said Harry Cleberg, head of the Kansas City-based
farm cooperative, at its annual meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the nation's two largest farm cooperatives voted on a
merger in late November. Although Farmland members overwhelmingly
supported it, the Cenex vote fell just short of the required
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think it is the right direction to go,'' Cleberg said
near the end of Farmland's two-hour general session.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg also said there was continued merger interest at Cenex,
whose members held their annual meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely surprising and unbelievably
disappointing ... if that issue didn't come up for re-evaluation on
their part,'' Cleberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The two co-ops have said a merger would save $500 million over
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, however, have said previously that many of those
savings could come from joint ventures without a merger. Some Cenex
members also questioned Farmland's financial condition because of
its greater use of debt.
</P>
<P>
   The topic played prominently in Cleberg's speech, which was a
review of the 70 years that Farmland has been a cooperative. He
emphasized moments when the board of directors agreed to borrow
heavily to expand or enter new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the co-op ``bet the farm'' on its first oil well,
Cleberg said. Though the well paid for itself in 18 months, the
move was risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some think Farmland is stretching its balance sheet today,
boy, they should have been around in 1940,'' Cleberg said. ``Yes,
Farmland has been gutsy and aggressive ... since its early
beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg also pointed to the co-op's decision in the late 1940s
to build its first nitrogen fertilizer plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was again when Farmland stretched its balance sheet,'' he
said. ``It was so tight they had bankers sitting around the board
table.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Cleberg told the members, ``you bet the farm again when
you entered the pork business.'' Similarly, expansion and mergers
throughout the 1990s have depended on borrowing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Block, who was secretary of agriculture in the Reagan
administration, also spoke at the session. He urged Farmland
members to accept the reality of industry consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's undeniable,'' Block said. ``Figure a way it can work for
you, especially if farmer co-ops can have some of that muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Members and employees of three local Farmland co-ops who
attended said they would support another attempt to merge with
Cenex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll try,'' said George Bett, an employee of
Farmers Cooperative Elevator Co. in Garden Plain, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby Moon, a member and director of Prairie Ag Cooperative in
Mount Union, Iowa, said Farmland had benefited from the increased
attention and discussion sparked by the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for the co-op system to have this,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest applause came when Cleberg talked about Farmland's
victory last week in a 16-year dispute with the Internal Revenue
Service. The tax court ruling lifted a potential $400 million tax
bill from Farmland, though the IRS may appeal the ruling. An IRS
spokesman said Wednesday that the agency would not comment on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Junior Strecker, general manager of the Scott
Cooperative Association in Scott City, Kan., received the 1999
Dreyer Award. The award annually recognizes outstanding management
of a local cooperative in the Farmland system.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: ADAMS TELLS OF CAR BUG
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, accused the British intelligence services of
planting a listening and tracking device in his car during recent
negotiations on a Northern Ireland settlement. Adams said he had
protested to the British and Irish governments, which co-sponsored
the talks. ``I think this is a hugely serious breach of faith,'' he
said, and called upon British Prime Minister Tony Blair to find out
who was responsible.

   The Ulster Freedom Fighters, the biggest Protestant paramilitary

But it said it would consider disarming only when the Irish
Republican Army had ``already begun to decommission its arsenal of
weaponry.'' An IRA representative has already met with the
disarmament group.

   A compromise over the jailing of Abdullah Nouri, a popular

convicted him of anti-Islamic activities agreed to an early appeal.
The court had earlier denied the 50-year-old cleric the right to
appeal, and he had said he preferred to serve his five-year
sentence. Nouri's lawyer said the cleric would enter his candidacy
for elections in February, which his conviction appeared intended
to block. A successful appeal would allow him to lead the reform

QUILTY PLEA EXPECTED IN COMPUTER VIRUS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A New Jersey computer programmer will plead guilty Thursday to
having unleashed a computer virus in March that disabled thousands
of corporate e-mail systems, several people close to federal and
state prosecutors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The programmer, David L. Smith, 31, was arrested on April 1
after FBI agents and officials from America Online helped
investigators from the New Jersey attorney general's office
identify the Internet access provider that was apparently first
used to send the virus. The program, named Melissa, spread faster
than any previous virus and was reported to have infected more than
100,000 computers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who will plead to both federal and state charges, will
acknowledge that the Melissa program caused more than $80 million
in damage, a sum largely reflecting the hours spent by computer
system administrators to remove the virus, people familiar with the
plea negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 million figure is significant, legal experts said,
because it suggests that Smith will receive the maximum sentence
provided under a federal computer crime statute: five years in
federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   The length of a sentence in such cases is determined by factors
including the amount of damage, cooperation with prosecutors and a
guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is trying to send a message that they
take these kinds of Internet crimes very seriously,'' said Mark D.
Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is president of the Global
Integrity Corp., an Internet security company based in Reston, Va.
``This is also a recognition that a single individual with a
computer has the ability to cause tens of millions of dollars of
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies including Microsoft were forced to shut down their
electronic mail servers and cut themselves off from the outside
world temporarily to clean out the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, no federal charges had been brought against Smith,
with state prosecutors taking the lead. He was initially charged
with violating four state laws; if convicted on all the state
counts, he faced a maximum of 40 years in prison and a $480,000
fine. Several people involved in the case said he would plead
guilty to one state count and one federal count.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa program spread by making use of features in the
Microsoft Outlook e-mail program that permitted it to automatically
mail itself to people in the user's electronic address book. The
subject line of the resulting message read, ``Important Message
From'' and then listed the name of the sender, who was likely to be
known by the person receiving the message. The message itself said,
``Here is that document you asked for, don't show anyone else.
;-).''
</P>
<P>
   The attached document contained a list of passwords to
pornographic web sites. When an unsuspecting computer user opened
the document, a program hidden within the file spread the virus
through electronic mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Melissa virus did not intentionally destroy data on infected
computers. But because it spread with exponential speed, it caused
electronic mail congestion and stoppages around the country and led
to widespread panic in corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   Although the virus was intended to be the work of an anonymous
author, investigators said Smith had made several errors that led
to his quick apprehension. They said he had left a variety of
digital ``fingerprints'' in the virus-carrying document that
included his name, the names of several of his employers and a
serial number that identified the computer upon which the virus had
been created. That information was quickly discovered by amateur
antivirus investigators and computer security experts and turned
over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although the program was first posted to an Internet
news group from a stolen America Online account, investigators used
Internet connection data and telephone records to quickly trace the
starting point to Smith's apartment in Aberdeen Township.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Edward Borden Jr., and state and federal
officials declined to comment Wednesday on the terms of the plea
bargain. But state officials issued a statement that a court
proceeding involving the Melissa case would take place Thursday
morning at the Monmouth County Superior Court in Freehold.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the United States attorney's office said a news
conference had been scheduled for immediately after a court
proceeding on the case Thursday afternoon at the Martin Luther King
Federal Courthouse in Newark.

 AMAZON.COM SHOPPING OFFERED ON iNTERNET-READY SPRINT PCS PHONES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint PCS customers now can ring the
registers at Amazon.com using their wireless telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based online retailer and Sprint PCS introduced a
service Wednesday that will allow customers with Internet-ready
phones to open accounts or to access existing ones and browse a
series of menus to buy items ranging from music and books to movies
and toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, this is shopping from your wireless
phone,'' said Andrew Sukawaty, president of Sprint PCS. ``It opens
up a whole new avenue of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   As wireless phones and the Internet grow in popularity,
carriers, software companies and content providers are rushing to
move popular Internet services to mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS' agreement with Amazon.com is unlikely to generate
big merchandise sales or lots of calling volume this holiday
season, analysts said. The number of customers using Web-capable
phones is still tiny, and most consider Web browsing on a wireless
phone tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS has 5 million customers, about 1 million with
Internet-ready phones. It won't say how many customers have
subscribed to its wireless Web service, but the Kansas City company
could help Amazon.com add customers as the mobile Internet market
grows.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a Yankee Group study, the companies estimated that 48
million consumers would use ``smart'' phones by 2002, and 204
million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Amazon.com deal is a significant marketing
announcement for Sprint PCS, which is trying to include as many
brand-name content providers in its service as possible, including
Yahoo, CNN, Bloomberg and Ameritrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``About every 45 or 60 days, you'll see another one of these
content deals,'' Sukawaty said. ``We're very much focused on what
people want, on people's lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Mark Zohar of Forrester Research, consumers will
demand price plans with unlimited Web access, phones that are more
Web-friendly and applications that are more customized before they
will adopt wireless Internet devices en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very early in this game,'' he said. ``The pricing
isn't there, the devices aren't there, and the applications are
rudimentary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sukawaty agreed that the services were still in their infancy
but said the company already was seeing a fair amount of general
browsing through the existing sites.
</P>
<P>
   He said consumers would see the services evolve constantly and
probably would see new pricing packages this year geared
specifically to Internet usage rather than voice calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS also aims to sell its services to trucking, delivery
and utility companies, which often are heavy users of wireless data
applications. Earlier this month, Sprint PCS announced an agreement
with IBM Corp. to develop custom applications for companies that
would allow employees to access their corporate networks through
their wireless phones.
</P>
<P>
   Sukawaty would not release financial details of the Amazon.com
deal but said, ``We get a share of the activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS stock closed Wednesday at 99 1/2, up 5 3/16, after
hitting a 52-week high of 100. Amazon.com ended at 88 9/16, up 2
1/2.

WOMEN'S TOURNEY TO BE MOVED UP TO 2002

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of all the euphoria in the qualifying draw for the
men's 2002 World Cup, Sepp Blatter, the president of sport's
worldwide governing body, announced on Tuesday that the next
women's World Cup would be moved up a year, from 2003 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can present us with a unique financial obstacle,'' Jim
Moorhouse, a spokesman for the U.S. Soccer Federation, said
Wednesday from the federation's headquarters in Chicago. ``We have
a 50-50 breakdown for men and women, and it can be a problem
committing money and resources for both in the same year.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's World Cup in Japan and South Korea will be played from
June 1-30. The women's is expected to be scheduled for the fall,
very likely in Australia, and Blatter apparently wants the hoopla
of the men's tournament to carry over to the women.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's team will compete in the Australia Cup next
month. The defending World Cup champions will play the Czech
Republic on Jan. 7, Sweden on Jan. 10 and Australia on Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   As the defender, the U.S. women automatically qualify for the
women's next World Cup. The American men must go through qualifying
rounds to advance to the finals.  &QL;

WOMAN CELEBRATES AT LEAST 113 YEARS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Today is the 114th birthday anniversary of
Susanne Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Or the 113th or the 115th.
</P>
<P>
   The records in Texas, where she was born, near Houston, haven't
survived as long.
</P>
<P>
   And don't ask Lynn how old she is. It's a touchy subject, and
she won't answer.
</P>
<P>
   Her 82-year-old granddaughter, Lula Jackson, thinks 1885 is the
correct year of her birth. It couldn't be much later because Lynn
had a baby in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a birthday party at 2 p.m. at the Medicalodge Post
Acute Care Center at 6500 Greeley Ave., Kansas City, Kan., where
she has lived nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the birthday girl will attend remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very feisty, very strong,'' said Tammy Boisselle,
activity director. ``If she doesn't want to do something, she's not
doing it. She'll hold her wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff at the Medicalodge calls her ``grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandma. Even her granddaughter has grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's health is about as good as it can be for her age, Jackson
said. She can hear if you speak up. She can see well with her one
good eye.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said her grandmother was a gardener who enjoyed eating
vegetables, especially greens such as turnip, mustard and collards.
Fatback and greens was a familiar dish in her household.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn's other ingredients for longevity are staying out of the
hot sun and living as close to the Ten Commandments as possible,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn is a Baptist who always attended church.
</P>
<P>
   Her face lit up when asked if she was looking forward to meeting
Jesus some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always ready to go all the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't say much, but when the soft-spoken woman does, it
helps to have someone who is familiar as an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her favorite expressions are, ``Lord have mercy,'' and
``I don't know why I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked Wednesday how much longer she wanted to live, she
said, ``I want to live a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly she is a favorite among her caretakers, who greet her
with hugs and kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing assistant Yvonne Jackson, who is not related to Lula
Jackson, stopped for a kiss at the end of her workday and agreed to
help interview Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you drink alcohol?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you smoke?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you chew tobacco?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like snow?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like sweet potato pie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um-hum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like snakes?''
</P>
<P>
   No response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like to swim?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Only in a tub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like men?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like to cook?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. Eat, too. All the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Jackson promised to bring Lynn some candy for her
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something easy to eat,'' Lynn cautioned. ``Don't bring me no
tobacco.''

FIRE DEPARTMENT BURIES BELOVED DEPUTY CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TRISHA L. HOWARD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jim Schneider had two loves in life: His
family and his fire department.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, both families laid the lifelong Raytown, Mo.,
resident to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, deputy chief of the Raytown Fire Department, died
Saturday after a two-year battle with brain cancer. He had
undergone three surgeries and many rounds of chemotherapy. Through
it all, he kept his job with the department he had served for
almost 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a strong will to survive in the face of adversity,''
Fire Chief Rick Mawhirter said.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Raytown Fire Department attended, in dress uniform,
the funeral of a man they described as quiet, gentle and, above
all, dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, 49, joined the department as a volunteer in 1970.
Even then, he would sometimes spend nights at the station, said
Linda Schneider, his wife of 28 years. On their wedding day, when
Linda went to pick up Jim's tuxedo, she spotted him dressed as
Smokey Bear, riding on the Fire Department's float in the Raytown
Roundup Days parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the men liked so much about him was that, rather than
assigning them something to do, he was right there doing it with
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Being a firefighter was a job made for Schneider, who spent much
of his childhood in Raytown helping out at his father's bus
company. That early love of buses and big trucks lived on in
Schneider's career with the department, Linda said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cheatham, a former Raytown firefighter, couldn't count the
number of fix-it projects that he and Schneider undertook. They
built a storage cage for the department's tools. They replaced the
plumbing in the old fire station on 63rd Street, saving the fire
district the cost of a plumber. They overhauled an old pumper
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they designed a portable cascade system to fill
firefighters' fresh-air bottles at the scene of a fire. When
Cheatham left the department in 1986, Schneider ordered the parts
from a catalog and put the system together by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``His need to keep these trucks running kept him running,''
Cheatham said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was until the end. Schneider returned to work a week after
his first operation, two years ago. Almost every morning, he
struggled to get out of bed, to perform even such simple tasks as
putting on his socks and shoes, Linda Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to keep doing what he had done for as long as he
could,'' she said. ``And when he couldn't do it anymore, he came
for the companionship of the men.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schneider was frustrated at all the tasks he could no longer
do, said Battalion Chief Kevin Foster. More than once, Foster found
him out in the department's garage, cleaning the wheels of the fire
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Through the pain and the exhaustion, Schneider kept pressing on,
until, finally, a week ago, he was so sick that his co-workers had
to carry him home.
</P>
<P>
   But family and friends alike said that work had kept Schneider
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he would have stayed in bed those mornings, we would have
lost him sooner,'' Foster said. ``He was an inspiration to us
all.''

NEW CYBERSQUATTING LAW TOUCHES OFF LAWSUITS OVER NAMES IN
CYBERSPACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been less than two weeks since President
Clinton signed a new law banning ``cybersquatting,'' _ registering
trademark names as Internet addresses in the hope of selling them
at huge profits. But trademark holders around the country are
already filing lawsuits to win the rights to names they consider
their property.
</P>
<P>
   In California, New Zealand's America's Cup team Wednesday won a
temporary injunction preventing two New Zealand men who own the
americascup.com domain from using it for a Web site. Harvard
University accuses two men of trying to auction off a number of
Harvard-related domains, and the National Football League has sued
a man who runs NFL-related sites that it says violate the league's
trademarks and promote gambling.
</P>
<P>
   All three suits cite the anti-cybersquatting legislation that
was signed into law Nov. 29 as part of the omnibus budget bill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law say large companies will use it to muscle
coveted domain names, as Internet addresses are known, away from
small companies and individuals with legitimate claims to the
addresses. But even they see a bright side to the suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argued against the law,'' said A. Michael Froomkin, a
University of Miami law professor. ``But now that we have it, I
guess we will all win by getting some convergence on what the
standards are.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was also opposed by the Clinton administration, which
feared it would undermine attempts by the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, to cut the number and cost of
complicated international lawsuits over cybersquatting by
consigning trademark-related spats to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was picked by the administration last year to take over
management of the Internet's domain name system. It has already
approved rules for assigning trademark disputes to international
arbitration centers. Those rules, however, only apply to domain
names dispensed by newly created registrar companies.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the more than five million domain names
already assigned with the popular .com, .net and .org suffixes were
distributed by Network Solutions, a Herndon, Va., company that
until this year had a monopoly over those domains. Only domains
Network Solutions assigns after Jan. 1 will be subject to Icann's
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The first dispute under the Icann process was filed last week
with the World Intellectual Property Organization. The names of the
parties have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Icann rules were intended to give trademark holders recourse
against cybersquatters who were, in effect, using domain names to
extort money from trademark holders, or in some cases to
intentionally mislead or misdirect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But trademark holders felt the rules did not go far enough. They
persuaded Congress to pass the new law, which allows them to sue
cybersquatters for possession of domains and to seek up to $100,000
in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The America's Cup suit was filed by Quokka Sports, a company
handling the Web sites for the New Zealand America's Cup yachting
team, the same day the law was signed.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand team first began trying to wrest americascup.com
from two Auckland men, Arron Brett and Justin Nicholas, in June,
but the dispute has been tied up in litigation in New Zealand ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Quokka's lawyer, Terry Gross, Wednesday persuaded a federal
judge in San Francisco to issue an injunction barring the use of
the americascup.com domain until it can be determined whether the
address should be turned over to the America's Cup New Zealand
team, which as the current holder of the cup also holds the
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Gross insists it is a clear-cut case of cybersquatting, that the
men were using the trademark to attract advertisers and to
misdirect people looking for the official America's Cup site,
americascup.org. He said they also violated trademark laws by using
official race logos.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Brett and Nicholas, however, insists the
case is an example of trademark holders trying to abscond with a
legitimately owned domain name that the plaintiff covets after
failing to register it.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Peter Dengate-Thrush, said: ``These young
entrepreneurs are being singled out unfairly. How are they going to
defend themselves in California?''
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast, meanwhile, Harvard filed a suit Monday in
U.S. District Court in Boston, alleging that Michael Rhys and
Michael Douglas registered 65 domain names that use the words
Harvard and Radcliffe. The men are accused of violating both
cybersquatting and trademark infringement laws.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard says that after the names were registered through
Network Solutions at its standard $70 rate, the defendants put the
names up for auction on the Web site HarvardYardSale.com, asking
thousands of dollars per name.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, the National Football League filed suit in U.S.
District Court in New York City, accusing Ken Miller of Clearlake
Park, Calif., and his Web sites _ NFLtoday.com, NFLtoday.net and
NFLtoday.org _ of violating a number of trademark and
anti-cybersquatting rules.

PINCAY WITHIN ONE OF SHOE

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay did have cause for celebration
Wednesday _ it was his son's 24th birthday and the Panamanian
Mother's Day _ but the steak dinner that will follow the jockey's
record-setting victory would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   After winning aboard Millie's Quest in the sixth race at
Hollywood Park to draw within one victory of Bill Shoemaker's
career-record 8,833, Pincay finished out of the money in two
attempts at the mark and will have to try again with four scheduled
mounts this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do it (Wednesday)`'' Pincay said, intending the
record as a gift for his older son, Laffit III, and mother,
Rosario. ``And I really thought I was going to do it. . . . But
it's only one (away), so I know someday I'm going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay rallied the slow-starting Millie's Quest through traffic
to a half-length victory for trainer Bobby Frankel and owners
Charles and Audrey Kenis in the sixth race. Millie's Quest was the
2-1 second choice of the bettors in the 1 1/16-mile turf race.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Panama native finished second with well-backed
Golden Arches in his first race of the day, and no closer than
fourth with four other mounts, including two tote-board favorites.
Russemira, morning-line favorite in the fourth race, was reported
ill and scratched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (early) races, I couldn't do any good,'' Pincay said. ``I
used to get stressed out when I couldn't win on favorites, but now
I realize my horses just weren't running good enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's four mounts today include morning-line favorite I Be
Casual in the fourth race and a mare auspiciously named Finally in
the fifth. He's scheduled to ride five horses Friday.

MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER IN WIFE'S DISAPPEARANCE IN 1985  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.D., N.J., Nev.)   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen years ago, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum stormed out
of her apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side after an argument
with her husband and never returned. At least that is what police
documents show her husband, Robert Bierenbaum, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, prosecutors with the Manhattan district
attorney's office offered another explanation as they arraigned
Bierenbaum, 44, on charges of second-degree murder. They say there
is evidence that Bierenbaum, a plastic surgeon who now lives in
Grand Forks, N.D., killed his wife, drove her body to Essex County
Airport in Caldwell, N.J., then dumped her body as he flew his
private plane over the Atlantic Ocean somewhere between Montauk
Point, N.Y., and Cape May, N.J. Her body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``powerful and compelling case,'' Assistant
District Attorney Daniel Bibb told Judge Leslie Crocker Snyder of
State Supreme Court Wednesday that more than a decade of
investigation had led prosecutors to this conclusion, adding that
Bierenbaum had been free for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they could not detail the evidence that had
surfaced recently but added that much of it had to do with
inconsistencies in how Bierenbaum had explained his wife's
disappearance to others over the last several years. Bierenbaum's
lawyer, Scott Greenfield, refused to comment on the case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's sister, Alayne Katz, sat in the courtroom
weeping silently, holding close to her brother and her husband as
Bierenbaum entered a plea of not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on a $500,000 bond after he turned over both his
pilot's license and passport. The judge ordered him not to venture
outside New York City or New Jersey, where his parents live.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Mrs. Katz broke into sobs as she
described the years of waiting for this day and the pain she had
felt as Bierenbaum went on with his life. Bierenbaum, who left New
York a few years after his wife disappeared, moved first to Las
Vegas and then to North Dakota. He is remarried and has a small
child.
</P>
<P>
   Bierenbaum reported his wife missing on July 8, 1985, a little
more than a day after he said a quarrel drove her to leave their
apartment on East 85th Street, according to police documents. In
the missing person's report he filed, Bierenbaum said that he and
his wife had been quarreling during the previous weekend and that
they had been seeing a marriage counselor. He added that Ms.
Katz-Bierenbaum, a clinical psychology student, had been treated
for depression and that she had attempted suicide in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bierenbaum told investigators that he thought his wife
had gone to Central Park to ``cool off'' and that his building's
doorman had said he remembered seeing her leave.
</P>
<P>
   But by July 13, the police were beginning to doubt Bierenbaum's
story. During further questioning, he said the doorman might have
been talking about another day. When he was asked to recount what
he did between the time his wife disappeared and he called the
police, Bierenbaum did not tell the police he had gone on a
two-hour flight, the documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Police documents show that the police were told of several
instances in which Bierenbaum was moved to violence. But Bierenbaum
did not want to talk about them when the police interviewed him
after he reported his wife's disappearance, the documents show.

NEW TOY IDEAS DANCE IN THE HEADS OF PRECOCIOUS INVENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Mich., Colo., La., N.J., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the holiday season marches on, children fill their
wish lists with action figures, Furbies and the oh-so-popular
Pokemon. Next year there may be a new item on those lists: Mr.
Itchy Pants.
</P>
<P>
   The wiggling stuffed doll, which sings ``I've Got Ants in My
Pants,'' was chosen from 40 finalists as a grand-prize winner of a
toy invention contest for children. It is expected to be
manufactured and sold in time for next year's holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Itchy's creator, 11-year-old Nadia Smith of Voorhees, N.J.,
based the doll on a variety of acquaintances. ``There is a boy in
my class who never sits still, so we named him Mr. Itchy Pants,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Itchy's waggling eyebrows were inspired by another friend.
Among other phrases, the doll asks, ``Hey, do you think you can
help me out?'' and says, ``I'm still itchy!''
</P>
<P>
   The prototype, made from five knee-high nylon stockings, is
autographed on the stomach by its creator. Nadia said she never
thought her idea would take first prize, and was in tears of joy
and surprise after receiving the award. Her mother, Ellen Smith,
remembers that her daughter was reluctant to attend the event. She
says she would say, ``No, Mom, everyone's going to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Nadia advises other children to ``try hard and never give
up.'' She will receive a $10,000 college savings bond, as well as 7
percent of the royalties from the doll.
</P>
<P>
   The ants-in-the-pants doll was one of several humorous toys
spotlighted in a gathering Saturday in Manhattan. A clay prototype
submitted by Natalie Perach, 11, of Farmington Hills, Mich., showed
a monkey that smashed a banana in its face if the listener did not
laugh at its jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Monster Spy Truck, designed by 6-year-old Scott Klein of
Antioch, Calif., came with a hidden camera behind the windshield
and could be used for several undercover purposes. ``There is a
remote control to drive it,'' Scott wrote in the description, ``and
then you can take a picture of your sister without her noticing.''
His sister, Erinn, 3, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   There was the House for Change by Rebekah Glickman-Simon, 8, of
Boston, a doll house bank that divides a child's money into
Savings, Spendings and Charity. Rebekah got the idea for the house
when her parents increased her allowance, with the condition that
she organize her fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only had glass jars for my money,'' she said. Her doll house
has room for all her change, as well as a closet to stash that
other childhood treasure, candy.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was divided into two age groups, 8 and under and 9
to 12, with 20 finalists chosen from each group. The runners-up
were Daniel Fremont, 8, of Palo Alto, Calif., and Megan Griffin,
11, of Englewood, Colo., each of whom will receive a $2,000 college
savings bond.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel won for his Robopet, a cone-shaped remote-controlled pet
robot that wheels around and talks. ``I just thought about what
children would like,'' he said philosophically. Robopet ``will
follow you, and if it crashes into something it will say, `Ouch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Megan's design was the Karaoke Hair Care Brush, which plays
music and features a microphone so kids can sing along. ``My
friend's younger sister has a toothbrush that plays music and you
sing to it,'' she said. ``I thought it would be neat to have a
hairbrush that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan, with wavy, waist-length hair, admits she already uses her
hairbrush as a microphone when jamming to the radio with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The grand prize for inventors 8 and under went to Nicholas
Englisis, 7, of Morganville, N.J., who created a doll with a
picture-frame face where a child can put a snapshot of a friend.
Nicholas suggests that his My Favorite Friend doll come with a
disposable camera to take the pictures, as well as trading cards
that can be personalized with information on the friend. Also, the
doll should have different types of hair. ``You can change the
hair,'' he said, ``if your favorite friend changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Page, 8, of West Monroe, La., creator of the
action-figure Karate-Chop Kenny, had lots of ideas on marketing.
``Who knows,'' Matthew wrote in his proposal, ``there may be a
movie of him, and it will be good! And maybe a comic book to come
with it!''
</P>
<P>
   Another idea came from Jay Lonski, 10, of Shelby Township, Mich.
His bath-time boat, the Tubtanic, is designed to break up when it
hits the side of the tub and dump lifeboat-shaped soap into the
water. ``If I win, I am planning on making a sister ship called the
Sudsoapia,'' Jay said, ``and when it travels along, liquid soap
comes out the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest was sponsored by Amazon.com. Jeff Bezos, the
company's founder, was a judge. ``We wanted to do something to
celebrate toys, to celebrate innovation, and to celebrate kids,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two grand prize toys will be manufactured and sold online
through Amazon.com Toys. Seven percent of the royalties will be put
in a college fund for the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The four other judges, in addition to Bezos, were: the Olympic
skating gold medalist Katerina Witt; Lonnie Johnson, inventor of
the Super Soaker water gun; Richard Levy, a developer of the Furby
doll; and Thomas Edison Sloane Jr., a veteran of the toy industry
and a great-grandson of Thomas Alva Edison. The gathering also
featured a sticky Velcro Wall and Human Bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Each child appeared onstage to introduce his or her toy. ``It
was very emotional to see the kids come up and introduce their
toys, and say, `I invented this,''' Bezos said. Although the event
featured fun and games, the presence of the toy manufacturers
showed that toy making is also a serious commercial endeavor. After
the ceremony, Levy, who has developed more than 100 toys and other
products, said the children showed creativity that is often lost in
adults. ``I just hope they stay like this, because they don't know
what can't be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose Johnson Research and Development, in Atlanta,
focuses on toys, said of Nadia Smith: ``I wonder if she understands
how much her life has changed this day. Itchy Pants has the
potential to make her a millionaire.''

EDITORIAL: ENDING THE BRUTALITY IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   In the name of combating terrorism, Russian troops are
threatening to destroy anyone who does not, or cannot, leave the
Chechen capital of Grozny. Of the more than 20,000 residents, who
remain huddled in rooms without heat, light or even windows, many
are too old or frightened to leave. Most of these holdouts are
innocent bystanders, far from the ``bandits'' who are the declared
targets of Kremlin leaders. It is time for Russia to show
restraint, to start making certain its armies observe basic
humanitarian principles and to begin searching for a way out of
this tragic war.
</P>
<P>
   The global outrage about Russian killing of civilians in
Chechnya comes as Russians prepare to elect a new Parliament on
Dec. 19, and with each round of international censure,
anti-Westerners move up in the polls. Thus some analysts suggest
that any political settlement in Chechnya cannot occur until after
that date. This pressure makes the public statements of Russian
leaders more understandable, but it does not relieve them of the
obligation to stop troops from razing Grozny and indiscriminately
killing innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   This military strategy, as President Clinton noted, does not
work, since it punishes Chechen civilians more than the Chechen
rebels. With every Russian abuse, Chechen moderates also become
more radical. Moreover, the carnage, increasingly visible on world
television, damages Russia's stature as other nations come to
recognize habits from its authoritarian past.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at his news conference Wednesday that he saw no
workable way to impose international sanctions, since Russia has a
veto in the United Nations Security Council. He argued that cutting
United States aid that helps dismantle nuclear weapons or promotes
democratic capitalism is not in America's best interest. The
International Monetary Fund, however, has continued to delay a $640
million credit for Russia. Though the IMF insists that its action
is based solely on financial grounds, the delay rightly serves
notice to Moscow that Western help is not entirely unconditional.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians rained thousands of leaflets on Grozny this week
declaring to Chechens on the ground: ``You have lost!'' Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders should pay
attention to their own message, declare their military operation at
an end and quickly find a route to a political settlement.

NATHAN JACOBSON, 89, A LEADER IN ABSTRACT ALGEBRA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ala., Miss.)   (bl)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Nathan Jacobson, a renowned mathematician who developed
fundamental theorems and concepts and wrote many widely used
textbooks, died Dec. 5 at his home in Hamden, Conn., near New
Haven. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, an emeritus professor of mathematics at Yale, was
regarded as one of the world's leading researchers in abstract
algebra. He was best known for his research in basic algebraic
structures called rings. Among his leading contributions in this
area were the Jacobson Density Theorem, a fundamental theorem in
the discipline, and the Jacobson radical, a mathematical structure
that plays an important role in analyzing rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you understand the Jacobson radical, then you have an
entree into understanding the ring more completely,'' said Dr.
Michael Rosen, Jacobson's son-in-law, who is a professor of
mathematics at Brown University. ``It's part of the algebraic
language one learns.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was also known for his political efforts on behalf of
Jewish mathematicians from the Soviet Union, many of whom he helped
bring to the United States. In the early 1970s, when he was a vice
president of the International Mathematical Union, he became
embroiled in a battle with the organization's other vice president,
L.S. Pontrjagin of the Soviet Union, over that nation's refusal to
allow many of its mathematicians, mostly Jews, to address or even
attend meetings of the International Congress of Mathematicians.
The matter was never officially resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and last year won the
American Mathematical Society's highest honor, the Leroy P. Steele
Prize for Lifetime Achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He was also known to mathematics students around the world as
the author of more than a dozen standard textbooks, and many of the
30 or so graduate students he advised have become prominent
mathematicians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Seligman, a student of his who later became his
colleague at Yale, recalls visiting him in the final stages of
thesis work, frustrated by the many details still to nail down.
When he complained, Jacobson replied, ``Well, you're young.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I interpreted that as saying that if it's worth doing, then
it's worth knocking yourself out to do,'' Seligman said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Warsaw in 1910, Jacobson came to the United States with
his family in 1918. He was reared in Mississippi and Alabama, and
graduated from the University of Alabama in 1930. He received a
doctorate in mathematics from Princeton in 1934, advised by Dr.
Joseph Wedderburn, who proved some of the most basic results in the
theory of algebras. Jacobson later extended and generalized
Wedderburn's work.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson taught mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, the University
of North Carolina and Johns Hopkins University before being hired
at Yale in 1947. In 1963, he was named Henry Ford II professor of
mathematics. He retired from Yale in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's wife of 54 years, Florence Dorfman Jacobson, also a
mathematician, died in 1996. He is survived by a son, Michael, of
Norwalk, Conn.; a daughter, Pauline Jacobson of Providence, R.I.; a
granddaughter, and three great-grandchildren.

SOME FAITHS ARE OFFERING SPIRITUAL ALTERNATIVES TO MILLENNIAL
PARTYING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In and of itself, New Year's Eve is not a religious
occasion, though there have always been people who have felt drawn
more to churches than to parties full of Champagne and noisemakers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the sense of historic transition into the new
millennium appears to have increased the yearning among many for a
spiritual experience. If priests, ministers, rabbis and zen masters
in and around the city are correct, thousands of people will be
sitting in pews as the ball drops in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Some have decided to hold services and let their parishioners go
on to activities of their own choosing. Others are building the
celebration into the service.
</P>
<P>
   For example, parishioners at the Episcopal Church of the
Intercession in Harlem will hold a prayer vigil on Dec. 31. At 11
p.m., they will renew their Baptismal vows and receive the
Eucharist. They will stay on for a blow-out party in the church
with African-American, West Indian and Hispanic food and music.
</P>
<P>
   Worshipers at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rose of Lima in
Rockaway Beach, Queens, will pray the rosary in the different
languages of the neighborhood _ English, Spanish, French, Polish,
Italian and Gaelic _ watch the ball drop in Times Square on a giant
television screen, say Mass, and remain for Champagne and soda
bread and bagels until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are looking for something more. The Graymoor
Spiritual Life Center in Garrison, N.Y., sold out its annual New
Year's retreat months ago. Normally, 30 people come. This year, the
center, which is the world headquarters for the Franciscan Friars
and the Sisters of the Atonement, expects more than 100. They will
gather on top of the Mount of the Atonement near the chapel and
wait in silence for midnight. When the clock strikes 12, they will
march down the mountain carrying torches as onlookers ring bells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come close to extinction in this century through
natural disasters and through things people inflict on each
other,'' said the Rev. James J. Gardiner, director of the center.
``I think that somehow, for some strange reason, the year 2000 is
getting through a lot of clutter out there, and people are being
touched deep within themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Buddhist Village Zendo Temple in Greenwich
Village will go on a retreat to Litchfield, Conn., for six days of
silent meditation that they will break by chanting and ringing
bells at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the holiday poses a dilemma this year. New Year's Eve
falls on a Friday night, coinciding with the Sabbath, whose
observance is sacrosanct. The last time that a new Christian
century began on the Sabbath was in 1200.
</P>
<P>
   As an observant Orthodox Jew, Danny Heumann, a 24-year-old New
York University law student who runs social events for young Jewish
professionals, was aware of that when he began getting inquiries
about New Year's Eve last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to have an experience within the parameters of
observing the Sabbath,'' he said. So he rented Mendy's, a Kosher
restaurant in Manhattan, planning a sit-down Sabbath dinner, ``with
blessings over the wine, challah, a traditional dinner and a speech
about the weekly Torah portion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it was on a Friday night there was to be no music
except for Sabbath songs, and mainly we were planning schmoozing,''
Heumann explained. (Kosher restaurants may open on the Sabbath if
they are paid in advance for meals, the food is cooked in advance
and no Jew works on that day.)
</P>
<P>
   Heumann sold 150 tickets at $150 each and was expecting an
additional 100 reservations. But he didn't reckon with the
objection of the Orthodox Union, an organization that certifies
that food production facilities and restaurants meet Kosher
standards. When the union learned that the restaurant planned to
have an open bar until 1 a.m., it forbade the restaurant to hold
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an open bar till 1 a.m., what started out in the
first part of the night to be a Shabbaton suddenly becomes a
subterfuge for a New Year's Eve party,'' Dr. Mandell Ganchrow,
president of the Orthodox Union, said, using the Hebrew word for a
mixture of prayer, discussion, and social events. ``And New Year's
Eve is a Christian holiday. My friends and I don't celebrate New
Year's Eve, no matter what night it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are telling people is `Please remember it may be the
millennium, but the fact of the matter is that Shabbos has been
around for 3,500 years and will be here for the indefinite future.
The future of your children, family and people depends on
Shabbos,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Heumann found another site for his dinner, a vacant
space at Columbus Avenue and 89th Street. Yes, he said, there would
be an open bar.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis in the Conservative movement expect their adherents to be
in synagogue for Sabbath services too, but they advocate
acknowledging the millennium rather than ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that this is the millennium New Year's Eve, not a
small event in anyone's lifetime, and we also recognize the fact
that this is our Shabbat,'' Bruce Greenfield, executive director of
the New York Metropolitan Region of United Synagogue for
Conservative Judaism, said. ``We are asking congregations to have
family dinners that night, with singing and dancing, and perhaps
bring in a scholar-in-residence or a rabbi to do a program to
combine the holiness of Shabbat and recognition of the new year as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   He was astonished, he said, by the number of Conservative
synagogues _ more than 60 out of the 120 in the metropolitan area _
that announced they were planning special celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Islam, there will be little if any recognition
of the millennium. ``Muslims acknowledge that this is the beginning
of a secular new year, but it is not the Muslim New Year and
everyone will be preoccupied with Ramadan,'' said Peter Awn,
professor of Islamic religion at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Some churches in the neighborhoods surrounding Times Square, the
epicenter of New York City's celebration, have logistical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   On every Friday evening before the first Saturday of each month
for 30 years, there has been an all-night vigil with Masses and
prayers at St. John the Baptist, a church on 31st Street between
Seventh and Eighth Avenues. ``It was only canceled once in all
those years, when the church had a fire in 1997,'' The Rev. Francis
Gasparik said, ``and we were certainly planning it this month, on
the eve of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the people who run it started getting anxious when they
heard major restaurants were closing, theaters were going dark,
wondering about Y2K and whether the subways would work,'' he said.
``To me this is all paranoia. In anxiety we are supposed to trust
in God and not crawl into a hole, but unfortunately we had to make
a decision not to have the vigil this one time.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will Gasparik and his associates do instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll lock up and then have a New Year's Eve party in the
friary,'' he answered. ``We've been known to take a drink now and
then.''

NEW YORK LEGISLATURE CONSIDERING A CIGARETTE TAX INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Negotiators for Gov. George Pataki and the New
York Legislature are considering an increase in the state's
cigarette tax by at least 25 cents a pack to pay for a health care
plan that would expand medical coverage for low-income New Yorkers,
according to people involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are being driven by several factors: the looming
expiration of a state law that imposes surcharges on hospitals
bills to pay for care of the poor and the training of young
doctors; a consensus in Albany to use a significant part of the
money from the national tobacco settlement on health care; and a
growing recognition among lawmakers that something should be done
for the more than three million uninsured New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks say an agreement could be reached this
week, but they caution that a long list of issues remain, like the
governor's call for holding the line on Medicaid spending and the
demand by Democrats and labor unions for a plan that would cover
most of the uninsured, rather than a smaller percentage of them, as
Republican lawmakers have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the negotiations is a state law that adds $2.6
billion in surcharges to hospital bills, largely to help hospitals
train doctors who are just out of medical school and to care for
poor people who are not insured. The law expires on Dec. 31, and it
would be a crushing financial blow to the state's hospitals if it
were not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   In the current negotiations, Democrats are calling for the state
to provide coverage directly for the uninsured, starting with about
300,000 people. But Pataki's aides are concerned that such a plan
would encourage private employers to stop paying for their workers'
medical insurance and instead let the state provide it, people
close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wants to provide coverage mostly for the unemployed
while providing incentives for private employers to expand coverage
for their workers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers must also agree on how to pay for their plans.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree that some of the money will come from the $500
million a year that New York state expects to receive from the
settlement of the national lawsuit against tobacco companies. But
there are already competing plans being discussed for that money _
the state Senate, for instance, wants to subsidize the cost of
prescription drugs for the elderly _ and what is left is not nearly
enough to pay for the kinds of coverage for the uninsured that
state leaders are negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, has prompted negotiators for Pataki and
legislative leaders to consider raising the state's tax on
cigarettes, now 56 cents a pack, according to the people involved
in the negotiations. The increase was initially proposed by leaders
of 1199, the hospitals and health care employees union, a major
player in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the tax increase has not been determined, but one
proposal under serious consideration would increase it by at least
25 cents a pack, which would generate more than $250 million in new
revenue for the state.
</P>
<P>
   By approving such a measure, the governor and lawmakers would be
addressing criticism that the state government has been reluctant
to cross the tobacco industry by approving tougher anti-smoking
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The state last adopted a significant anti-smoking law in 1993,
when lawmakers raised the cigarette tax from 39 cents a pack, to 56
cents. At the time, that was the highest rate in the country, but
13 other states have since adopted higher ones. If the tax in New
York were raised by 25 cents, to 81 cents a pack, it would be the
highest in the region. New Jersey's cigarette tax is 80 cents a
pack, and Connecticut's is 50 cents. Hawaii and Alaska, on the
other hand, impose a cigarette tax of $1 a pack.
</P>
<P>
   If New York state raises its tobacco tax, it will also mark the
first time that Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph
Bruno, both Republicans, have agreed to a tax increase since they
rose to power five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A new tobacco tax would also put Bruno and Pataki in front of an
issue _ the fight against tobacco _ that has been led mostly by
Democrats. Anti-tobacco groups have long contended that the
additional tax will discourage thousands of teen-agers from ever
smoking and will encourage thousands more people, including many
adults, to quit.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry has long opposed tax increases, saying
they depress sales perhaps more than any other tobacco restriction.
The industry also says that such a tax is regressive, hitting the
poorest consumers the hardest, and that it encourages the smuggling
of cigarettes from states with lower taxes.

MARVIN KRATTER, 84, DEVELOPER WHO BUILT HOUSING AT EBBETS FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Ariz., Nev.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marvin Kratter, the New York real estate investor whose holdings
once included the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Ebbets Field (which
he eventually replaced with an apartment complex), died Oct. 24 at
a hospital in Encinitas, Calif. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatitis, said his son, Leslie M. Kratter, of
Hillsborough, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter's wide-ranging business interests also included
ownership or part ownership of the Boston Celtics basketball team,
a brewery and a pharmaceutical company. In 1956, he bought the
legendary Ebbets Field from Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter leased Ebbets Field back to O'Malley. But after O'Malley
moved the team to Los Angeles after the 1957 season, Ebbets Field
was demolished, and became the site for a development called Ebbets
Field Apartments. It was built under the Mitchell-Lama subsidy
program, which gave developers tax breaks and low-interest
mortgages as incentives to build middle-class housing.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,327-apartment complex, which stands on the block bounded
by Bedford Avenue, Montgomery Street, McKeever Place and Sullivan
Place in Crown Heights, was completed in 1962. It was later sold to
a Minneapolis company.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter headed a variety of companies, including Kratter Corp.,
National Equities and Countrywide Realty. He was also known for
building, in 1961, the Bridge Apartments above the Manhattan
entrance to the George Washington Bridge. The four 32-story
buildings were among the world's first aluminum-sheathed high-rise
structures.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge project was considered an imaginative use of air
rights over a public facility. Air rights were transferred by the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to the city, which sold
them at auction to the Kratter Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter also developed the St. Tropez, at 340 E. 64th St., in
Manhattan, one of the first condominium apartment buildings in the
city. For a while, he also owned the St. Regis Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter also bought the Knickerbocker Brewery, and his ownership
of the Boston Celtics was an effort to promote the beer in New
England. He owned the team from 1965 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He then moved to Rancho La Costa, Calif., befriended the singer
Steve Lawrence, and recorded a solo album, ``What I Did for Love,''
on the RCA label, using the stage name Mark Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Las Vegas for several years, serving as president of
Rom-American Pharmaceuticals. He retired to Del Mar, Calif., where
he lived at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter was born on Nov. 9, 1915, in Brooklyn and graduated from
Brooklyn College and Brooklyn Law School. He was also a certified
public accountant and worked as an accountant at the start of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Tucson in the late 1930s, and, in 1945, he started a
dude ranch, Rancho del Rio Estates, that went bankrupt in 1949. He
also filed for personal bankruptcy in 1953 but quickly recovered
financially, moved back to New York and became one of the early
practitioners of real estate syndication. He became a millionaire a
few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Kratter's wife, Lillian, died in 1994. Besides his son Leslie,
he is survived by a second son, David E. Kratter of Bellevue,
Wash.; a daughter, Sherry Santa Cruz of San Diego; a half-brother,
Arnold Kratter of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.

KNICKS ARE COOLING THEIR HEELS OVER EWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For more than two weeks, Patrick Ewing's teammates
have watched him plodding around the paint like a grape-stomper
without signs of a limp, a wince or trepidation. And still, Ewing
waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him back before now,'' Allan Houston said Tuesday
night. ``He looks like he's not scared of being banged. I don't
know. You can't judge anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks, Ewing's teammates have seen him wave
for the ball in the post and turn plays that left coach Jeff Van
Gundy marveling last week at how the 37-year-old center was one of
the New York Knicks' best players _ as is. And still, Ewing waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on with the guy,'' Marcus Camby
said. ``He just does his thing, and he doesn't say anything to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he began to practice all-out Nov. 22, Ewing has said very
little at all. For violating league policy on news media
accessibility, Ewing was fined $10,000 Wednesday by the National
Basketball Association, while the Knicks were assessed a $25,000
penalty for not enforcing the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But as members of the Knicks' organization have experienced, it
is hard to prod the stubborn Ewing into doing anything he doesn't
want to do. That is why his comeback will be on his terms, on his
schedule, when he says so.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not fully explain Ewing's cloak-and-dagger
behavior. On the rare occasion that he has uttered an update, Ewing
has said that his Achilles' tendon feels fine but that his body
needs time to get in ``basketball shape.'' Even so, as Van Gundy
has acknowledged, most athletes coming off an injury get in game
condition only by playing games.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't he playing? One theory behind Ewing's protracted
wait is far more complex than any physical reason for his absence:
maybe he is afraid. After missing 88 regular-season games over two
seasons, after coming back from a devastating wrist injury only to
endure a partly torn Achilles' tendon, after watching his number of
great nights decrease with each injury-marred season, Ewing may be
wondering just how much superstar is left in him.
</P>
<P>
   Is he still one of the league's elite centers? Will his taped-up
body betray him again?
</P>
<P>
   Each question could be causing him to pause and make sure he
returns with as grand an entrance as possible, whether that is
Friday against Philadelphia or next week. Appearance has always
been important to the proud Ewing. Even when no one else expects
miracle recoveries, he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to go out, have a great game and score
50,'' Ewing said after playing against Indiana in the 1998
playoffs, his first game in four months after major wrist surgery.
``No, not really. But I thought I would have had a better game than
I did.''
</P>
<P>
   He shot 3 for 11 in 27 minutes that day. In the summer months
afterward, teammates close to Ewing that season said he was wounded
when he read that his best days were over and that it was time to
phase him out as the team's go-to man.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Ewing proved those theories wrong _ to a point.
After takeout food and long nights behind close doors in the labor
negotiations, Ewing emerged from the lockout last January mentally
drained and physically soft, but pushed onward in a cram-session
season. Playing with Achilles' tendinitis, his numbers dropped off
and he missed a series of game-winning shots, but he also unearthed
an amazing effort to save the Knicks from playoff elimination in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, his Achilles' tendon partly tore. In a suit and
tie, Ewing watched the team go on to the finals. Latrell Sprewell,
Houston and Camby emerged as a trifecta of entertainment for the
Madison Square Garden crowds that adored their style.
</P>
<P>
   In Ewing's absence, the Knicks had grown new stars. Now, it is
hard to tell exactly where Ewing fits in on the star charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is such a macho league that `whose team is it?'
becomes a question that matters to some people,'' Van Gundy said.
``The answer should be, `We're a team, and we share in success
together.' Maybe that is bothering him. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one fully understands what is at work in Ewing's mind. He has
become increasingly reclusive and has growled at teammates who have
discussed his progress. The one player he has chosen to befriend
speaks little English and fawns over Ewing. It is an odd match, but
Mirsad Turkcan may offer Ewing something other teammates don't:
unconditional respect and 24-hour flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ewing is not viewed as ``the man'' in the locker room,
there is no underestimating the impact he can make on a team that
is an unspectacular 11-9 this season without him. Although he may
not openly admit it, Ewing may be ready to play a supporting role
next to Houston and Sprewell, as David Robinson has learned to do
beside Tim Duncan in San Antonio. Or he may, as he has suggested
since last summer, resist changing his ways.
</P>
<P>
   In whatever capacity he returns, the Knicks need Ewing as a
low-post force who can help their woeful rebounding, ease the
burden on Houston and Sprewell and stand side by side with Camby to
block shot after shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how people go back and forth,'' Van Gundy said.
``Some players don't want him back and say, privately, they believe
they are just as good without him. And yet they know that's false.
They just don't want him to take away from their individual
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ewing can play, isn't he displaying an act of selfishness? No
one will take away the heroic way he played through pain last
season, but if he is truly feeling fine after two weeks of
full-throttle practice, why isn't he playing? After all, Camby is
playing through tendinitis and so is Larry Johnson. Whatever the
reason _ whether he is wary of his physical condition or afraid of
what he will look like _ Ewing is keeping a few bewildered
teammates guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they see him practicing and wonder what is
happening,'' Van Gundy said. ``I'm sure, for some of them, it's a
tough situation.''

TASK FORCE QUESTIONS CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Some members of the task force seeking a home for a
new Arizona Cardinals stadium say it's time for the team to answer
the multimillion dollar question:
</P>
<P>
   How much will the team put up?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phoenix are hoteliers are up in arms over reports
that the panel is eyeing a new hotel-motel bed tax to raise public
funds for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, appointed by Gov. Jane Hull, began talking about
financing for a proposed $329 million stadium last week. But some
members say their recommendations hinge on how much public money
will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody will know that amount until the Cardinals and the NFL
disclose how much they plan to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a number that doesn't exist,'' said Robert
Fannin, a Phoenix attorney on the task force. ``It's kind of hard
to come up with a number when we don't know what the team will come
up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Task force member C.A. Howlett, an America West senior vice
president, said the atmosphere will be ``fraught with suspicion''
if the panel arbitrarily recommends public and private funding
levels without knowing how much the team and the league will ante
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the committee to be of value to the governor and
the Legislature, the committee needs to make recommendations which
are fair to all parties,'' Howlett said. ``The only way to make
fair decisions is to have adequate, accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   Howlett already has asked for projections showing how much money
the Cardinals would earn from a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Developer David Beckham, another task force member, said the
panel also is supposed to learn at its next meeting, scheduled for
next Thursday, Dec. 16, how certain Arizona taxes compare with
those in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals public relations director Paul Jensen said Wednesday
that team Vice President Mike Bidwill thinks it is ``premature to
get specific.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too many variables in the air,'' Jensen said,
including the site and type of stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we'll do the right thing,'' he said. ``The
Cardinals are committed to being a major contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   The team committed $75 million to Rio Salado Crossing, a
proposed stadium and convention center rejected by Mesa voters
earlier this year. The NFL said it would have allocated about $25
million to the cost, a commitment that would probably remain the
same, said Ted Ferris, Hull's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants told the task force last week that private funding,
on average, accounted for 29 percent of construction costs in 14
new NFL stadiums. Public funding supplied the rest. But Ferris said
that won't be acceptable to Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to have to be more private money,'' Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that, based on a cost of $329 million, the
Cardinals would have to spend more than $75 million to make a
stadium deal fly.
</P>
<P>
   As for the public portion of the financing, Hull has said she
wants the panel to focus on user fees, such as sports ticket
surcharges, and specialized taxes, such as a bed tax or a rental
car tax.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris reiterated Wednesday, Dec. 8, that Hull will not consider
a general tax increase to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   But tourism officials said Wednesday that the local hotel
industry is in an economic slump and unprepared to pay a new tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members certainly are not supportive of a tax to pay for a
Cardinals stadium,'' said Debbie Sweeney, executive director of the
Valley Hotel and Resort Association. ``There's no benefit to them
paying for a Cardinals stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   During meetings this week, Ferris discussed a proposal to pour
more money into state tourism promotion activities, using some of
the money raised by a new hotel bed tax.
</P>
<P>
   David Flack, a Scottsdale resort manager who is vice president
of the resort association and a member of the Arizona Tourism
Alliance, said such a plan makes the bed tax ``more palatable, but
it doesn't make it a slam-dunk by any stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, he said, hotel bookings through October were down
7.5 percent, compared with last year. Most hoteliers don't think
the industry is healthy enough to take on an added burden.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has complained for several years that Arizona's
tourism promotion lags behind other states, but the Legislature has
not responded with extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McDermott, director of the Arizona Office of Tourism, said
this year's budget is $8.8 million, with the national average being
$10.8 million. Arizona, he said, spends about half what the top 20
tourism states spend on average.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Hotel &AMP; Motel Association is meeting next week to
hash out its position on the issue. Executive Vice President
Michele Eckert said only one thing is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern about any increase in the bed tax,'' she
said, ``in an economy where the hotels are having a tough year.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the ghosts refuse to go away, you might as well
learn to dance with them. So there is Liza Minnelli, that most
haunted of popular entertainers, acting as an anxious but willing
hostess to a whole party of phantoms at the Palace Theater, where
her new concert show, ``Minnelli on Minnelli,'' opened Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Minnelli also has six cosmetically perfect chorus boys to
keep her company, but they are little more than window dressing.
It's the spectral presences of her famous father, the director
Vincente Minnelli, and her even more famous mother, Judy Garland,
who are her real co-stars here.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they and the shadows of her former selves, from the child
of Hollywood and backstage corridors to the hard-partying,
love-seeking gamine whose erratic career, love life and medical
problems were tabloid fodder for decades. There was a time when Ms.
Minnelli, 53, tried to ignore such ghosts when she performed. Now
she invokes them eagerly. As she is the first to say, she needs all
the assistance she can get these days.
</P>
<P>
   Liza Minnelli comeback concerts, and there have been many, are
phenomena unto themselves, glittery but unsettlingly primitive
exchanges of affection between a star and her fans. This is, of
course, an element in every veteran performer's courting of an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Minnelli is no contemptuously cool Marlene Dietrich or
flamboyantly strutting Mick Jagger, daring those watching not to be
impressed. She lets her needs and her neuroses take center stage,
and she has never articulated them as consciously and bluntly as
she does here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnelli on Minnelli,'' which has been directed and written by
lyricist Fred Ebb, the star's longtime friend, has been shaped as a
tribute to the films of Minnelli senior. But if you focus just on
the slide show of family photographs and the clips and songs from
those movies, performed by Ms. Minnelli and her solicitous chorus,
you're missing the point. And that is watching Ms. Minnelli's
presence grow from a fitful ember to a full if unsteady flame, fed
by those who come not just to worship but to reassure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dying up here,'' Ms. Minnelli seems to be saying as soon
as she steps onto the stage where her mother, who died in 1969,
perfected the art of show business as support therapy in legendary
appearances in 1951 and 1967. ``Bring me to life.''
</P>
<P>
   The process, in this instance, requires a shaky, even painful
first act. Only in the evening's second part does Ms. Minnelli look
and sound as if she is feeling at home again. It is that evolution
rather than any sustained slickness of presentation that makes
``Minnelli on Minnelli,'' which runs through Jan. 1, so perversely
compelling. The exorbitant $125 top ticket price is for the
spectacle of raw emotion, not professional polish.
</P>
<P>
   Though she still sports the black helmet of hair that has been
her trademark for decades, Ms. Minnelli is at first almost
unrecognizable. It's not just that she is substantially heavier;
it's that the famously dynamic Ms. Minnelli, who has had hip
replacement surgery several years ago, seems so sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   When she raises her arms and points her fingers, to signal
projections of photographs and film stills and sequences associated
with her father, who died in 1986, the gestures are tentative, as
if this fabled Tony and Oscar winner had never tried them out
before.
</P>
<P>
   In her spangly, form-concealing Bob Mackie outfits she initially
brings to mind a rich suburban housewife who has always wanted to
pursue a singing career and now, finally allowed to do so, is
scared out of her mind. The big, brimming eyes, however, sending
out their silent S O S, are pure Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is the voice, although it is definitely more limited in
range and rougher at the edges than it once was. This is
particularly true in the opening numbers, which include the
standards ``If I Had You,'' delivered statue-still before a
microphone, and a more animated rendition of ``Taking a Chance on
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of most of the dancing falls to the handsome young
men who act as fawning suitors to Ms. Minnelli's uneasy diva. They
are, for the record, Jeffrey Broadhurst, Stephen Campanella (whom
Ms. Minnelli ogles in a tiresome and repeated bit of comic
business), Billy Hartung, Sebastian LaCause, Jim Newman and Alec
Timerman.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these singer-dancers have been seen to better advantage
in other Broadway shows. Here they are the male equivalents of
Vegas chorus girls, cozying up seductively to Ms. Minnelli,
striking provocative poses or pushing the star around in a chair to
the strains of ``Shine on Your Shoes'' from ``The Band Wagon.''
Their time alone onstage, haplessly tumbling and kicking to such
would-be show-stoppers as ``That's Entertainment,'' is largely time
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the second act, which is also the occasion for Ms.
Minnelli's scripted reminiscences of life with father, that she
finds her own feet, not to mention her larynx. Her hypnotic,
luxurious interpretation of ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads'' (from
``Kismet'') is the evening's most fully accomplished vocal moment.
And she does a truly stirring version of Lerner and Lane's ``What
Did I Have That I Don't Have'' that resurrects the high-gear
Minnelli of yore.
</P>
<P>
   When she takes her final leave of her audience, after a musical
ode to her father written for the occasion by John Kander and Ebb,
the professional gestures are all in place again, right down to the
don't-forget-me smile she flashes over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, this strange, awkward evening will be remembered less as
one of song than as a conscious manipulation of a fragile, needy
persona. She admits to having ``a panic attack'' in the middle of
one song, adding that she quelled it by thinking of ``all of you.''
When she observes that people still treat her as if she were 16
years old, a middle-aged man in the audience yells out, ``That's
because we love you!'' and it is one of many such declarations.
</P>
<P>
   The show also features a drolly revised version of ``I'm Glad
I'm Not Young Anymore'' (from ``Gigi''), with new lyrics by Ebb, in
which she alludes to her friends in Alcoholics Anonymous, her salad
days at Studio 54 and even her weight gain: ``How sweet to eat food
not caring that/Someone will say, `My God, she's fat.''' The
central premise of this exercise in theater as therapy is clearly
that things are better dealt with out in the open.
</P>
<P>
   You should also know about the production's most brazen act of
ghost-raising, which occurs just before the encore, in which Ms.
Minnelli sings along with ``The Trolley Song,'' while Judy Garland
performs the number in a clip from ``Meet Me in St. Louis.'' It's
worth noting that while Vincente Minnelli is mentioned often, by
his full name, Garland is referred to as ``my mother.'' Those who
don't know the reference, and what it signifies, will be utterly at
sea at this show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A chemical explosion Wednesday morning at a nuclear bomb factory
in Oak Ridge, Tenn., injured three workers, one seriously, and
contaminated a fourth worker with uranium.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred about 9:30 a.m. as workers tried to clean
up a mixture of sodium and potassium that had been spilled last
Friday. Something, possibly water, reacted with the sodium to cause
the explosion, plant officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One worker was airlifted to a hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn.,
with second-degree burns over 25 percent of his body, said Margaret
Morrow, acting vice president for defense programs at
Lockheed-Martin Energy Systems, which runs the factory for the
Energy Department. The worker was in serious but stable condition,
she said. Two others with lesser burns were admitted to a hospital
in Oak Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is assembling a team for an investigation.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Twelve Texas A&AMP;M University students died horribly on
his watch, and the thing Ray Bowen really wants you to be upset
about is an editorial cartoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-seven young people were hurt. Another remains in critical
condition. All of the injuries, all of the deaths, could have been
pre vented by university President Bowen and the other grown-ups in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bowen rails against a car toon by The Arizona
Republic's Steve Benson, turns down The Re public's $10,000
donation to victim relief funds, and says in a letter to the
newspaper that accepting the money would ``do violence to our
ethical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The university president mentions nothing about the violence
done to young bodies when a 40-foot pile of logs collapses on them.
</P>
<P>
   He says nothing about the violence done to the families of
students crushed under an avalanche of tim ber. &QL; 
A LOT OF SMOKE &QL; 
He says nothing in his letter about the ethical standards that
allowed a largely unsupervised group of kids, some of them drunk,
to attempt to construct what amounts to a four-story building with
no blueprint and little professional guidance.
</P>
<P>
   It made a big mess.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to cover up that much debris is with a lot of
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Texas now say that one of two crane operators
working on the annual Bonfire at A&AMP;M when it collapsed was a
student, not a licensed operator.
</P>
<P>
   The university also has admitted that freshmen and sophomores
were al lowed to work on the upper levels of the log tower, another
violation of school rules.
</P>
<P>
   A former A&AMP;M construction science professor and Bonfire adviser
said recently that he believes the structure collapsed because
safety and design features were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, there was not someone over seeing all of this to make
sure it was being done,'' said Larry Grosse, a professor at
Colorado State Univer sity.
</P>
<P>
   However, the thing we should be most concerned about, according
to President Bowen, is a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``violence to ethical standards'' Bowen mentions doesn't
include the man he named to lead an investiga tion into the
disaster. He's the head of a construction company who also happens
to be chairman of Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which pushed for
limits on punitive damages in injury and death cases.
</P>
<P>
   Like, maybe, lawsuits filed against the university. &QL; 
NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   Another member of Texans for Lawsuit Reform is the owner of a
company that supplied one of the cranes used to build the Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   All of them say there is no conflict of interest. No violence to
anyone's ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies have shown that two of the 12 who died were legally
drunk, and another had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The university could have outlawed the Bonfire years ago. Near
as I can tell, the only defense offered for cutting down and
burning thousands of trees _ rather than using the timber to, say,
build houses for the poor _ is ``tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   The last excuse for any bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Benson's cartoon pictured the Bon fire disaster sharing space
with the inferno at Waco and the racially motivated murder of James
Byrd in Jasper, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter turning down the 10 grand, Bowen says, ``Texas A&AMP;M
will not allow itself to become an agent for The Arizona Republic
as it tries to manage the public criticism it is receiving.''
</P>
<P>
   He should have added, ``Instead, I'd like to deflect the
criticism we should be receiving by raising a big stink over a
cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice try.
</P>
<P>
   But when the smoke clears, any violence done to the ethical
stand ards at Texas A&AMP;M will prove to have been self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   And the university bigwigs will find out you can't reclaim the
moral high ground by standing on the bodies of the dead. &QL;

55 ARE INDICTED IN INQUIRY INTO JET SKI THEFTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Puerto Rico)  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city that is constantly struggling to reduce
crime and improve the quality of life, few have noticed a
bedeviling problem on the city's edges: Jet Ski theft.
</P>
<P>
   This evil has not gone ignored by city, state and federal
authorities, however. Wednesday, some of the city's top law
enforcers announced that they had smashed a network of Jet Ski
thieves who scouted the city's waterways and snapped them up, and
then resold them in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound like a ``Baywatch'' plot line transferred to the
Rockaways, but officials said it was all too real: a 17-month
sting, naturally called ``Operation Jet Ski,'' resulted in the
indictment of 55 people and the recovery of 27 of the 55 Jet Skis
they traced, worth $412,000. Teaming up for the arrests were the
Queens district attorney's office, state and city investigators and
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the ring was suspected of
stealing 300 Jet Skis, three-quarters of all the ones stolen in the
metropolitan region since 1995. Nevertheless, only 27 such thefts
were reported last year as the investigation continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jet Skis are proliferating all over the United States,'' said
Safir, standing by one of the stolen watercraft in the Queens
district attorney's office. ``This sends a message that anyone
stealing Jet Skis will wind up in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   While one might have thought Jet Skis as alien to the city as
dog sleds, 60,000 such motorized water scooters are registered in
New York state, and aficionados have taken a shine to the coastal
waters around New York City, including Jamaica Bay and the Rockaway
Inlet, said a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the police department's vessel theft unit noticed an
increase in stolen water scooters, and notified police precincts
containing waterfronts.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, 1998, police officers from the 100th Precinct on the
Rockaway Peninsula of Queens noticed a suspicious truck with four
water scooters by the waterfront, and ``Operation Jet Ski'' was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Officers followed a crime wave that the authorities said led
from the home of Kim Aiello Jr., 21, of Mill Basin, Brooklyn, to
Wascar Valenzuela, the owner of Caribbean Central Sport, in San
Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Officials contend that Aiello oversaw a band of thieves who
either stole water scooters or gave up their own to defraud
insurance companies. At least 52 craft were stored at Aiello's
residence and then shipped to Puerto Rico with the help of
middlemen in Oceanside and West Hempstead on Long Island, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello's lawyer, Joseph Mure Jr., said his client pleaded not
guilty yesterday. ``They got him down as a ring leader, but he's 21
years old and he really doesn't have a criminal past,'' said Mure.
``He has Jet Skis of his own, but he claims to have no involvement
in sending these Jet Skis to Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela could not be reached for comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Forty people have been arrested, and 15 more are being sought. &QL;

A SMOKE SCREEN FOR A BONFIRE

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Twelve Texas A&AMP;M University students died horribly on
his watch, and the thing Ray Bowen really wants you to be upset
about is an editorial cartoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-seven young people were hurt. Another remains in critical
condition. All of the injuries, all of the deaths, could have been
pre vented by university President Bowen and the other grown-ups in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bowen rails against a car toon by The Arizona
Republic's Steve Benson, turns down The Re public's $10,000
donation to victim relief funds, and says in a letter to the
newspaper that accepting the money would ``do violence to our
ethical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The university president mentions nothing about the violence
done to young bodies when a 40-foot pile of logs collapses on them.
</P>
<P>
   He says nothing about the violence done to the families of
students crushed under an avalanche of tim ber. &QL; 
A LOT OF SMOKE &QL; 
He says nothing in his letter about the ethical standards that
allowed a largely unsupervised group of kids, some of them drunk,
to attempt to construct what amounts to a four-story building with
no blueprint and little professional guidance.
</P>
<P>
   It made a big mess.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to cover up that much debris is with a lot of
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Texas now say that one of two crane operators
working on the annual Bonfire at A&AMP;M when it collapsed was a
student, not a licensed operator.
