<HEADLINE> Lobbying for China Trade Steps Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When lawmakers opened their hometown  
newspapers recently, they found full-page ads from the Business 
Roundtable declaring that China's growing economy meant an 
increased appetite for U.S. food, cars and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	When their aides brought in the mail, they found letters from  
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with exact figures on how much in 
products and services their home states exported to China last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	And when they returned home for the Fourth of July recess, they  
found local members of the National Association of Manufacturers on 
their schedules for meetings to discuss China trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been making a point (that) at every one of those  
meetings ... somebody stands up and says, `I want to explain the 
importance of the China issue to the American manufacturing 
community,''' said Howard Lewis, the NAM's vice president for 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bumpy year in U.S.-Chinese relations, the U.S. business  
community is taking nothing for granted in its annual battle to 
renew China's normal trade relations with the United States. U.S. 
businesses exported $18 billion in goods and services to China last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced on June 3 he was renewing the  
status, but Congress has 90 days to overturn it if it chooses. 
Lawmakers are set to vote as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The business lobby particularly is concerned that a bipartisan  
congressional investigation that recently concluded Beijing stole 
U.S. nuclear secrets might jeopardize the decision to allow free 
trade between China and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is harder,'' acknowledged Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., former  
chief executive officer of Corning Inc., known for its 
glass-science breakthroughs, and a strong supporter of normal trade 
relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	The stepped-up lobbying effort is visible everywhere. For  
instance, the Business Roundtable targeted just a dozen lawmakers 
last year during its China trade lobbying efforts. This year, its 
sights are set on 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has not been an issue more heavily lobbied,'' Rep.  
Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Chamber of Commerce officials argue that normal trade  
relations and problems outlined in the espionage report by the 
committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., are separate 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Espionage is a way of life. We have to protect against it.  
That has nothing to do with trade,'' chamber lobbyist William 
Morley said. He is telling lawmakers that their vote will be 
counted when the organization compiles its annual vote ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber's president, Tom Donohue, delivered a similar  
message to Cox, who agrees that the two issues should not be 
linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible to have any China policy one wishes while  
attending to the counterintelligence and security problems in our 
report,'' Cox said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents cite both the Cox report and the 1996 campaign finance  
scandal as reasons for rejecting normal trade relations. Rep. Frank 
Wolf, R-Va., brings it up during his discussions with GOP freshmen, 
urging them to vote no. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer has made  
his opposition to China trade well-known. ``I'm a janitor's son, 
and I believe in free enterprise, but I don't believe in putting 
your country second and putting your profits first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters are hoping for an overwhelming vote of support to  
give impetus to efforts to bring China into the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sending heavyweight corporate executives to talk  
to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, they also have asked lower-level 
employees in congressional districts to call the district offices 
of their local representatives to deliver the same message: Free 
trade means jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Each lawmaker has gotten a letter from the Chamber of Commerce  
with state-by-state statistics showing the value of trade with 
China. For example, New York exported $679 million worth of goods 
in 1998, California $2.4 billion.

	Arraignment Expected in Yosemite Murder  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A hotel maintenance man who was  
arrested in the beheading of a naturalist at Yosemite National Park 
is expected to be arraigned tomorrow, the FBI said today. Cary 
Stayner was accused of killing Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, whose 
decapitated body was found near her Yosemite housing on Thursday. 
Stayner is also a suspect in the killings of three park sightseers 
earlier this year. The 38-year-old man was arrested yesterday.

	Shuttle May Have Leaked Fuel  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia may have been  
leaking hydrogen fuel all the way to orbit last week from one of 
its main engines, NASA said today. If it proves to be a leak as 
photographs suggest, the engine could have shut down abruptly if 
more fuel had seeped out, resulting in a never-before-attempted 
emergency landing within minutes of launch. As it turned out, 
Columbia made it safely to orbit Friday under the control of Air 
Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a U.S. 
spaceship.

the United States would not mediate between them. Richard Bush said 
Washington wanted the two sides to engage in more dialogue and 
avoid provocations, an apparent criticism of a recent statement by 
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui that demanded Taiwan and China be 
recognized as equally legitimate states.

	RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- World leaders walked solemnly through  
screaming crowds in this ancient North African capital today to 
honor Hassan II, for 38 years king of a poor, placid nation 
committed to peace in a tumultuous region. Hundreds of thousands of 
Moroccans, wailing and chanting in the July sun, watched the royal 
cortege and its escort of Western, European, Middle Eastern, 
African and Asian heads of state, including President Clinton. 
Hassan died Friday at age 70.

	Test-Tube Babies Can Trace Parents

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As the world's first test-tube baby celebrated her  
21st birthday today, the government announced plans to give 
children born from donated sperm or eggs the right in adulthood to 
trace the donors. The announcement dismayed the country's largest 
donor organization, which said there would be a fall in donors, 
fearful of being traced decades later by offspring who are total 
strangers. The Department of Health said a consultation paper will 
be published in the next few months on ways of changing the law 
that guarantees anonymity to donors.

	Pope Laments Treatment of Elderly  
</P>
<P>
	CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) -- Himself slowed down by old age,  
Pope John Paul II today lamented that the elderly are increasingly 
shunted to the sidelines of advanced societies. ``In societies with 
advanced industrial and technological development, the condition of 
the elderly is ambivalent,'' the pope said during his vacation in 
Castel Gandolfo. ``On one hand, they are ever less integrated into 
the family and social fabric. On the other hand, instead, their 
role becomes ever more important, above all for the care and 
education of grandchildren,'' John Paul continued, speaking from 
his balcony.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Internet security researchers at Georgia Tech  
believe the neural networks they are working on may be the key to 
stopping hackers. Even though Georgia Tech's The Sentinel Project 
doesn't ``think,'' the group of programs is set up in different 
``nodes'' much like a human brain. The network is designed to 
recognize abnormal data, which could signal that someone has broken 
into the system.

two years ago, Armstrong sprinted to the finish line on the 
Champs-Elysees to claim the inspirational victory that had seemed 
certain for days.

<HEADLINE> Crowd Cheers at Brett's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- They cheered. They laughed. They wiped  
away tears. 
</P>
<P>
	But mostly they cheered.  
</P>
<P>
	Watching George Brett's Hall of Fame acceptance speech on the  
huge Jumbotron at Kauffman Stadium Sunday proved as thrilling for 
Kansas City fans as all the clutch hits and heroic plays he made 
during his memorable 21-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started watching George when I was 13. I grew up watching  
him and now my sons are George Brett fans, too,'' said Howard Cline 
of Kansas City, Mo. ``I think he's the greatest ballplayer of his 
day. And now everybody in the world knows he's one of the greatest 
of all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the crowd of 21,000 who sweated through 100-degree heat  
watching the Royals rally to beat Oakland 13-11 in 10 innings stuck 
around to watch a tape of his speech, which had actually taken 
place during the sixth inning when the home team trailed 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll never forget that 1980 season when he hit .390,'' said  
Tom Flaherty, who drove down from Omaha, Neb., just to watch Brett 
several times a year. ``That was the greatest season I ever saw any 
ballplayer have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Brett was careful to thank almost everyone who  
had a hand in his career, and the crowd applauded at the sound of 
almost every familiar name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hal McRae would do whatever it took to win a game,'' Brett  
said. Big applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Then an even bigger cheer went up when Brett mentioned the late  
Dick Howser, who managed the Royals to the 1985 World Series title, 
and Whitey Herzog, who took them to three straight AL West 
championships from 1976-78. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whitey said, `George, you're going to play third and hit third  
every day I'm managing,''' Brett said as the fans applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	When he thanked his mother for all she'd done and said in a  
choking voice, ``I love you,'' Jan Cook of Lee's Summit, Mo., had 
tears running down her cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's so sweet. But that's just like George,'' she  
said. ``I think it was just beautiful the way he thanked his family 
and all his teammates and everything. We were really lucky to have 
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When George said how lucky he was to have Kansas City, the crowd  
really cut loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``You welcomed me into your beautiful city and into your  
homes,'' Brett said. ``And to this day I am so proud to call Kansas 
City home. I have so many things to be thankful for and you made it 
possible for me. Thank you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you, George. Thank you,'' several fans shouted.

<HEADLINE> Alaskan Animals Get Run of Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) -- Set gray wolves loose in Idaho and you  
hear the ranchers' howls. Allow wild turkeys to hob-gobble about 
Connecticut and you get letters to the editor. Release a prairie 
dog in Colorado and you have the locals up in arms. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
	But up here in the Great Land, talk of troublesome turkeys and  
pesky prairie dogs is met with a great big yawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Read the license plates, fella. This is The Last Frontier.  
The corner of America where critters outnumber people 5-to-1. (Only 
critters larger than Dall Sheep are counted in Alaska.) The land 
humans and hairy ones share and share alike. 
</P>
<P>
	As a moose controller on the Talkeetna rail gang, Sunday  
Bumanglag's job is to make sure moose don't become moose meat when 
the Seward-to-Fairbanks train passes through. Mind you, moose 
control can be tricky. Especially if a 7-foot, 1,600-pound bull has 
taken a liking to a particular section of track. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumanglag normally tries the whistle first.  
</P>
<P>
	No response? He blink-blinks the headlights.  
</P>
<P>
	Moose didn't blink? The foreman CA-RONG!s a warning shot with a  
hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	If Bullwinkle still doesn't get the picture, Bumanglag goes to  
Plan D. 
</P>
<P>
	He waits.  
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, for half an hour. If passengers start to grumble,  
Bumanglag makes an announcement: ``We have a stubborn moose, ladies 
and gentlemen.'' That's usually enough to turn scowls to smiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, this is moose country,'' Bumanglag says. ``We're just  
guests in the mooses' living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Alaska, critters are everywhere and humans do a pretty good  
job of living alongside them. Non-Alaskans might say that's because 
farming never took root here and because the state's so big that 
humans and animals don't trip over each other. 
</P>
<P>
	But folks here note that while the Paul Bunyans of the Lower 48  
were scalping forests and pushing many animals toward oblivion, 
Alaskans came to appreciate their critters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bush makes you a different person,'' says Steve Mahay, an  
outdoorsman in Talkeetna, an assemblage of log cabins and house 
trailers in Susitna Valley. He earns a living by taking visitors on 
trails and on his riverboat to gawk at things non-human in the 
bush. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saratoga, N.Y., where he was raised on a farm in the '60s,  
Mahay loved catching muskrats in steel traps. When suburbia came 
creeping, he gathered his guns and his wife and rode the ``Alaska 
Highway'' west in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahay built a trapper's cabin and lived off game meat. With a  
.44 magnum and a .22 rifle he killed 11 bears during his first few 
years in the bush. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't do it anymore, though. ``I don't get any pleasure  
shooting them,'' Mahay says. ``Funny how that changed.'' Now he 
counts how many bears he spots from his riverboat. His single-day 
record: 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Lloyd, director of the Nature Center at Chugach State  
Park, doesn't know Steve Mahay but insists she can explain his 
change of heart. ``When you live in the wild,'' she says, ``you 
learn tolerance for all living things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is a land where bald eagles lunch on poodles and  
dachshunds; where flocks of Canada geese keep jetliners in holding 
patterns; where an intruder in your home is likely to slobber and 
leave a pile on the rug. 
</P>
<P>
	In Juneau, the state capital, black bears poke through trash  
bins, raid bird feeders, even duck into supermarkets. Eight years 
ago, a cub entered the Barlett Regional Hospital emergency ward. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody called 911.  
</P>
<P>
	Laura Stats, a nurse, found the bear sitting on a bed. She fed  
it some milk and apples, sedated it, called the Fish and Game 
Department and returned to her rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anchorage, where half of human Alaska resides, nobody is  
surprised to drive home from work and find a moose on the roof. 
``Happens all the time,'' says Rick Sinnott, a wildlife biologist. 
At his desk at the Fish and Game Department, the phone rings 
nonstop, people calling to report critter capers: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A porcupine falling out of a tree into some woman's new  
hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A squadron of ravens chewing up the windshield wipers on cars  
parked at a mall. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A moose dragging away a kid's swing set.  
</P>
<P>
	-- A bear mauling a bear-shaped archery target.  
</P>
<P>
	``We still aren't sure if the bear was playing or trying to mate  
with it,'' Sinnott says. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is one misconception humans have about critter country,  
it is that pets will feel at home here. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple on vacation from Georgia learned otherwise a few years  
ago after stopping at a Valdez gas station. When the woman let her 
Chihuahua out to relieve itself, a bald eagle swooped down, 
snatched it by the scruff and circled up and off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dog gave one yelp,'' Dennis Fleming, the station  
attendant, says, ``and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaskans know wild animals are not Disney characters. Moose  
cause more than 100 traffic accidents a year in Anchorage. They 
destroy fences, eat shrubbery, and ``we tend to have a stomping 
every couple of years,'' says Bruce Bartley, a spokesman at Fish 
and Game. 
</P>
<P>
	The last death by moose stomping in Anchorage was in January,  
1995. Myong Chin Ra, 71, was walking on the University of Alaska 
campus when a cow moose charged. He died hours later of multiple 
head fractures and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Hoonah, a village in southeastern Alaska, a  
grizzly attacked 14-year-old Cody Mills as he walked a trail. The 
boy was in surgery for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ain't the zoo,'' says Sgt. Darlene Turner, chief of state  
troopers in Kodiak. ``You should appreciate animals, respect them. 
But you can't romanticize them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly not at a crime scene.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were taking photographs at a murder scene when a  
moose appeared -- head down, ears back, hackles up. Then it charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were diving over balconies, running back and forth, around  
parked cars trying to get away from that thing,'' Turner remembers. 
The smile on her face fades. ``It sounds funny now, but when a 
moose's on YOUR tail, it's not that comical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After three times around the lot, an idea struck: The siren.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once he heard it,'' she says, ``Mr. Moose was off like a  
shot.''

<HEADLINE> Nintendo Chairman To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Howard Lincoln, who helped build Nintendo into a  
household name in the United States, is planning to retire from the 
video game maker next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln, chairman of the company since 1983, will remain on  
Nintendo of America's board, though he won't be involved in 
day-to-day operations, said Perrin Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the 
Redmond-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln will retire Feb. 14, his 60th birthday, Kaplan said.  
</P>
<P>
	His retirement announcement has fueled speculation that the  
Seattle Mariners co-owner could be in line for the team's chief 
executive post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lincoln is among 16 owners of the Seattle Mariners and has been  
at the forefront of a recent battle between the owners and county 
politicians over financing of Safeco Field, the team's new 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaplan refused to speculate on whether Lincoln would be taking  
over the Mariners except to say, ``He's obviously very deeply 
involved with the Mariners and has a deep love for baseball as 
well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariners CEO John Ellis, 70, recently told The Seattle Times  
that he was considering retiring as head of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Lincoln's leadership, Nintendo of America, the U.S.  
subsidiary of the Japanese game maker, grew from a tiny startup 
with a half-dozen employees to a major powerhouse in the video game 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo is the No. 2 seller of video games in the nation, after  
Sony. The company's video game systems include Nintendo 64 and Game 
Boy.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Pushes Welfare State Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Undaunted by attacks from leftist allies,  
Germany's chancellor on Sunday defended his ambitious plans to trim 
the country's welfare state and spur private enterprise in a bid to 
revive a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhard Schroeder, who has sought to emulate Britain's Tony  
Blair and President Clinton by pushing his Social Democrats party 
toward the political center, accused his left-wing critics of being 
out of touch with reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the overwhelming majority in my party and, by the way  
... the majority of voters, has understood the necessity of 
economizing,'' the chancellor said in an interview with German 
television ZDF. ``Whoever talks of anti-social imbalances simply 
has no idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders -- traditional allies of the Social Democrats -- and  
some in the party's own left-wing have attacked Shroeder's budget 
plans as heartless and socially irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Cabinet approved an austerity budget for 2000  
that includes $16 billion in across-the-board cuts and $4.2 billion 
in corporate tax relief. Parliament is to vote on the package in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Hans Eichel, who wants to balance the budget in  
eight years, warned that more cuts were on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The efforts to save must become even greater,'' he was quoted  
as saying in Sunday's Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder was elected last fall primarily on a promise to put  
Germans back to work. But with unemployment still stuck above 10 
percent, his government's poll numbers have been in a steady 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	His 9-month-old government has suffered from internal bickering  
between market-friendly forces led by the chancellor and old-style 
leftists. 
</P>
<P>
	Leftists, however, lost their most powerful advocate, Oskar  
Lafontaine, who left his post as finance minister in March, 
allowing Schroeder consolidate his grip. 
</P>
<P>
	In the television interview, Schroeder called the push for a  
balanced budget ``economically and politically correct,'' noting 
that the U.S. economy is booming in large part because it has 
already achieved it. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Schroeder's critics were outraged at a report released  
last week by Economics Minister Werner Mueller, who called on 
Germans to show more personal initiative and reduce their 
dependence on state handouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Mueller, who has no party affiliation, suggested the government  
concentrate social programs on the ``really needy'' and called for 
a sharp cut in government spending relative to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Sunday interview, Mueller denied he was trying to undo  
Germany's cherished welfare state built up in the postwar boom 
years, but only to ease the increasing demands on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``For decades, many believed that the state could solve every  
problem,'' he told Der Tagesspiegel newspaper. ``So it's difficult 
... to turn back this belief in a full-insurance state. But when 
the public treasury is empty, there's nothing else left.''

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Rules Out Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political  
ally, on Sunday ruled out IRA disarmament by May, dealing another 
blow to the shaky prospects of implementing last year's peace 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Implementation of the peace accord in this British province is  
stalled over the outlawed IRA's refusal to hand over any of its 
weapons. The main Protestant politicians, the Ulster Unionists, 
have refused to sit in a Cabinet with Sinn Fein while the IRA 
remains armed. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties last week missed a third deadline for forming a  
Protestant-Catholic coalition Cabinet envisaged in the peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie  
Ahern, then persuaded former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, the 
architect of the accord signed on Good Friday last year, to again 
help with negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord does not specify that the IRA must start disarming  
before Sinn Fein can hold Cabinet positions. It says, however, that 
the IRA and pro-British Protestant paramilitary organizations must 
surrender all weapons by May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell hopes to break the deadlock with what Blair calls a  
``review'' of the accord, which will begin Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein leaders said Saturday after a preliminary meeting with  
Mitchell that they would deliver a ``considered assessment'' of the 
state of the peace process later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell has said he believes the agreement can still be made to  
work -- despite gloomy signals from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, after the second anniversary of its  
latest cease-fire, the IRA blamed the British government for the 
failure to implement the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA also noted that it broke its previous cease-fire with a  
massive London bombing in 1996 following demands for disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, described the  
statement as ``rather menacing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Sinn Fein's Doherty reiterated the position held by  
his party and the IRA that the accord is in trouble because the 
Cabinet has not been formed. 
</P>
<P>
	Disarmament, he said, ``has to be in the political context, and  
there is no political context at the moment.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia, Mir Crews Chat in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts  
took a break early Sunday to chat with the only other humans in 
orbit -- the three men aboard Russian space station Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio chat was to be a conversation between Frenchmen Michel  
Tognini on Columbia and Jean-Pierre Haignere on Mir, but Mir's 
commander broke in to greet his counterpart on the shuttle, Eileen 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Afanasyev congratulated Collins on becoming the first  
woman to command a U.S. space flight. After first trying to say it 
in English, Afanasyev settled for eloquence in his mother tongue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart,''  
Afanasyev said in Russian. ``You are a courageous woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Spasibo,'' Collins replied, thanking him in Russian. She has  
visited Mir twice, in 1995 and 1997, when she served as a shuttle 
co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The space travelers chatted in French, Russian and English  
across a ham radio link for about 10 minutes as Mir and Columbia 
soared some 7,700 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was something of a reunion for Tognini and Mir cosmonaut  
Sergei Avdeyev -- both spent two weeks aboard Mir in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again we're flying together,'' Tognini said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see each other but we can imagine each other,''  
Avdeyev responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Tognini congratulated Avdeyev, who holds the record for the most  
time in space -- 714 days over three flights. When Avdeyev returns 
to Earth at the end of August, he will have been on Mir for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation was a short break for the Columbia astronauts,  
who were spending their third day in space performing various 
scientific experiments. The experiments remain the focus for the 
crew members, who completed their main objective Friday by 
releasing the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory into space. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, the first of five engine firings to boost  
Chandra's orbit was performed successfully. Another four rocket 
firings -- the next of which is scheduled for Sunday night -- will 
put the world's most powerful X-ray telescope in an orbit extending 
one-third of the way to the moon.

<HEADLINE> $82.5M Van Gogh Painting Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- No one in the art world seems to know the  
whereabouts of the most expensive painting ever sold, even though 
it has not been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The painting is a portrait by Vincent van Gogh of Paul-Ferdinand  
Gachet, the doctor and friend of the artist who watched over him in 
the last weeks of his life. Many consider the 1890 painting to be 
van Gogh's last important portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York tried to find  
the painting for its current exhibition, museum officials could not 
locate the masterpiece, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday. 
The exhibition catalog noted the absence with the words ``present 
location unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Japanese businessman Ryoei Saito paid $82.5 million at  
an auction for ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' the most money ever paid 
for a painting. Saito, the honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper 
Manufacturing Co., said he stored it in a warehouse after looking 
at it once. 
</P>
<P>
	That year, shortly after paying the Japanese government a $24  
million tax bill, he told friends that the van Gogh and a Renoir he 
bought at the same auction should be burned at his cremation so his 
heirs would not have to pay an inheritance tax. At the time, it was 
regarded as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, he died at age 79. It is unclear if anyone has  
seen the van Gogh since. 
</P>
<P>
	``The painting belonged to Mr. Saito and not the company. So  
we're not quite sure where it is now,'' Daishowa Paper spokesman 
Iwao Sakamoto said. ``But we heard that they sold the painting to 
somebody else. There's no fact to the rumor that he brought the 
painting to his coffin. Somebody owns that painting.''

<HEADLINE> UN-Iraq Deadlock Hurting Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Consumer goods sales have come to a virtual  
standstill due to an all-time low demand, forced by Iraq's 
plummeting currency rate and growing uncertainty about the 
country's future, traders said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is so grim that some of us are seriously  
thinking of shutting down,'' said Assaad Isameal, the owner of a 
clothing store in Arasat, Baghdad's most fashionable thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn began after the December 1998 airstrikes on Iraq by  
the United States and Britain to punish it for forcing out U.N. 
weapons inspectors searching for Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the strikes, the Iraqi dinar nose-dived to 2,250 to a  
dollar after it had stayed firm around 1,500 during 1998. It is now 
hovering around 2,000. But consumer confidence remains weak amid 
dwindling hopes that the U.N. Security Council will act swiftly to 
lift U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions cannot be removed until the council certifies that  
Iraq has gotten rid of all its illegal weapons. That objective 
remains unreachable while Iraq remains adamant about not allowing 
the resumption of weapons inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions crippled Iraq's economy in the initial years, but  
many Iraqis, including commodities traders and transporters, began 
making money after the United Nations started the oil-for-food 
program in December 1996. The program allows Iraq to sell oil under 
U.N. supervision to buy food and other essential items for its 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The free rations left many Iraqis with spare cash for the first  
time in years and Baghdad's shopping areas began to flourish last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders say gloom has descended again as no one appears to  
know how the 7 1/2-month-old Iraq-U.N. crisis will unfold, especially 
since Security Council members themselves are divided over how to 
deal with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Television shop owner Ahmed Mohammed cannot remember when he  
last sold a set. ``It was long time ago and I am afraid may not 
happen again,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinan Hussam, a tailor, said landlords are slashing rent to  
ensure tenants do not close businesses. But even his rent of around 
$5 dollars a day is hard to afford. ``To tell you the truth I am 
not earning (that) much,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Astronaut Tells of Bumpy Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- As the first American woman in  
space, Sally Ride had to contend with reporters asking if she wept 
at work and with flight planners obsessing over whether she should 
take along makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	And after her space shuttle mission, she said, the attention was  
so intense she wished someone else had been first. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen years later, as commander of the orbiting Columbia,  
Eileen Collins has broken the shuttle program's last gender 
barrier. And while NASA no longer frets over makeup and 
menstruation aboard ship, the publicity factor hasn't changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part of her flight is actually going to be the  
post-flight, all the attention that she gets, all the demands on 
her time,'' Ride said last week. ``She's going to be whisked from 
one public appearance to the next public appearance, and it's very 
trying, very stressful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a 42-year-old Air Force colonel, acknowledges she's not  
ready for the hoopla that awaits her following Tuesday night's 
scheduled landing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you could ever be ready for it,'' she said  
from orbit over the weekend. But she promised to do her best ``to 
go out and spread the word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ride, now 48, left NASA in 1987 after flying once more in space  
and is now a physics professor at the University of California at 
San Diego. She called Collins before the mission to wish her good 
luck, just as she did when Collins flew as the first female shuttle 
co-pilot in 1995. She was present for Collins' first launch attempt 
early Tuesday but had to leave before Columbia finally took off 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview following a women's aerospace panel discussion  
last Monday, Ride recalled how NASA shielded her from the press 
before her flight aboard Challenger in June 1983. She was too busy 
training as the crew's flight engineer and robot-arm operator to 
make speeches or do interviews, other than the traditional crew 
news conference a few weeks before launch. 
</P>
<P>
	A male reporter asked Ride if she wept when things go wrong; the  
question still annoys her. One journalist wanted to know if she 
planned to have children, and another wondered if she'd wear a bra 
in space. ``There is no sag in zero-g,'' she replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Although her shuttle crewmates and most everyone else at NASA  
were accustomed by then to working with female astronauts, at least 
on Earth, Ride said experimenters came up with all sorts of things 
to do ``to me or for me'' during the six-day flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was, `Oh my gosh, how do we handle a female who might  
have her period in orbit?' There was 'Hmmm, I wonder if we should 
be carrying makeup on space shuttle flights?''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Makeup ended up on board, but Ride didn't use it. As for the  
``problem'' of menstruating astronauts, tampons simply were added 
to the shuttle toiletries kit. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Steven Hawley, who was married to Ride during her  
space-flying days and happens to be aboard Columbia with Collins, 
remembers far more fuss made over his ex-wife than Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of that just could be that the shuttle program itself was  
much younger back then, and this was the first woman flying in any 
capacity,'' Hawley explained before the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven American women have followed Ride into orbit, among  
them Mae Jemison, who became the first black woman in space in 
1992, and Shannon Lucid, who became the world's female space 
endurance champion with her six-month Mir mission in 1996. Teacher 
Christa McAuliffe never made it to space; she was killed in the 
1986 Challenger accident along with Judith Resnik, who two years 
earlier was the second American woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
	Ride said she never wanted or sought attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``My personality was the personality of a physicist who wanted  
to be an astronaut, not the personality of someone who wanted to be 
a public figure,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ride still guards her privacy. She recently made a cameo  
appearance on CBS-TV's ``Touched by an Angel'' and granted a few 
interviews during last week's countdown for Collins, but that's 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not so much that I don't like the attention. It's that I  
want to have a life. I want to be able to go to the supermarket. I 
want to be able to teach my classes. I want to be able to do 
research,'' she said. ``The nice thing about teaching at a 
university is that college students have to be cool, so they can't 
look like they're too excited.''

<HEADLINE> Shuttle May Have Leaked Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- One of space shuttle Columbia's main  
engines may have been leaking hydrogen fuel all the way to orbit 
and could have shut down abruptly if more fuel had seeped out, 
resulting in a never-before-attempted emergency landing, NASA said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If it proves to be a leak as photographs suggest, the possible  
engine shut down could have caused an emergency landing within 
minutes of launch, either in Florida or West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Columbia made it safely to orbit Friday under  
the control of Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to 
command a U.S. spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle, carrying five astronauts and the world's biggest  
and most powerful X-ray telescope, fell seven miles short of its 
intended orbit. A fuel leak could explain why the engines shut down 
one second or so early. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's mission operations representative, Wayne Hale, stressed  
there is no proof that one or two cooling tubes in the nozzle of 
the right engine were cracked and leaking hydrogen. Until the 
shuttle returns to Earth on Tuesday night and the engine is 
examined, no one will know for sure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when you're dealing with main engines, and they  
have a lot of energy flowing through that system, you want them to 
operate exactly down the middle of the pike because bad things 
might happen,'' Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think this is a case that even approaches that.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hydrogen has leaked from cracked tubes in engine nozzles during  
a couple other shuttle launches, but at a smaller rate than appears 
to have happened this time, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference, Hale showed a video frame of Columbia  
10 to 15 seconds after liftoff. A bright streak was clearly visible 
on the inside of the right engine nozzle. The two other engine 
nozzles were spotless. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooling tubes, if split, would have begun leaking one or two  
seconds before liftoff and continued leaking throughout the 
8 1/2-minute climb to orbit, Hale said. He estimated the potential 
leak rate at 3 pounds to 5 pounds of hydrogen per second -- ``not a 
lot of flow'' -- which would be equivalent to, at most, two broken 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Each engine nozzle has more than 1,000 of these slender steel  
tubes through which hydrogen flows to cool the bell-shaped nozzle 
and also to preheat the super-cold hydrogen fuel to improve engine 
efficiency. The circulating hydrogen comes from the giant external 
fuel tank strapped to the shuttle and flows directly into the 
engine combustion chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem -- whatever it was -- was unrelated to the short  
circuit that occurred five seconds into Columbia's flight. The 
prime controllers on two of the three main engines were knocked out 
by the half-second short, and the backup controllers kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins discovered a popped circuit breaker aboard Columbia late  
Saturday, which leads NASA to believe the short occurred either in 
the engine controller or in the electrical wiring that leads to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the three main engines are not used after propelling the  
shuttle into orbit, neither problem will affect the rest of 
Columbia's five-day flight, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and her crew went about their business Sunday,  
conducting science experiments and chatting by ham radio with the 
three cosmonauts on Mir, as flight controllers in Massachusetts 
kept track of the free-flying Chandra X-ray Observatory and flight 
controllers in Houston pored over the shuttle engine data. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always risk in space flight,'' Collins told a radio  
interviewer. ``Our job is to minimize the risk.''

<HEADLINE> Midpoint on Tax Cut 'Unacceptable' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton would veto a compromise  
splitting the difference between the $792 billion tax cut the 
Senate plans to act on this week and the $250 billion reduction he 
has proposed, administration officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and National Economic  
Council chairman Gene Sperling, on separate news programs, made 
clear that a $500 billion figure being offered as middle ground 
between the White House and congressional Republicans is 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will veto a tax cut of $800 billion or $500  
billion because it threatens our ability to secure Medicare and 
Social Security and pay down out national debt,'' Sperling said on 
``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted that projected budget surpluses -- estimated  
at almost $3 trillion over the next decade -- ensure they can meet 
the goals of saving Social Security and Medicare and reducing the 
debt while also giving Americans a needed tax break. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is who spends the surplus and the president has  
taken on almost a reckless approach to the facts,'' Sen. Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said on 
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys are shameless,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said to  
Sperling. Gramm said the GOP's proposed $800 billion tax cut was 
outstripped by administration plans for more than $1 trillion in 
new spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate this week is expected to approve its version of the  
10-year, $792 billion tax cut. The House last week, in a vote that 
broke largely along party lines, passed its bill that matched the 
Senate's version in size but differed in the nature of some of the 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton repeatedly has attacked the size of the cuts. At a  
Democratic fund-raiser in Colorado on Saturday, the president said 
it would ``imperil the future stability of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Breaux, a moderate Democrat from Louisiana, said he  
planned to offer a compromise that would combine a tax cut of 
around $500 billion with a Medicare reform bill including the 
president's goal of extending Medicare coverage to prescription 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get together we are heading for a major train  
wreck which I think would be terrible for the American people,'' 
Breaux said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the House and Senate put off sending a bill to the  
president, ``take a breath of fresh air'' over the August vacation 
period and return in September ready to talk taxes and Medicare 
with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said last week he  
would be open to a compromise in the $500 billion to $600 billion 
range. In any case, it is likely the GOP bill would not go to the 
White House until after Labor Day, so Clinton could not veto it 
when Republicans are away from the capital on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would reduce the tax rate on the bottom bracket  
from 15 percent to 14 percent, differing from the House version 
that includes a 10 percent across-the-board cut over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill offers capital gains cuts while the Senate plan  
raises the amounts individuals can put into individual retirement 
accounts. Both would ease the so-called marriage penalty, although 
the Senate bill is more generous.

	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Joan Benoit Samuelson, gold medalist 15  
years ago in the first women's Olympic marathon ever run, insists 
she's now a simple soccer mom interested more in her kids' games 
than her own races. 
</P>
<P>
	But she still laces on running shoes every day and last fall  
qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 42, Samuelson says she's thrilled with the growing  
excitement over women's sports, especially the recent U.S. victory 
in World Cup soccer and the rapid expansion of the Women's National 
Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were pioneers in sports that opened the door for me, and  
I would like to think in some small way, I helped open the doors 
for the young women ... today,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt of that. Samuelson showed regular people  
what they could accomplish with a lot of hard work, says Marjorie 
Snyder, associate executive director of the Women's Sports 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joan, as an athlete, came along at the right moment and had  
the right attitude about sport,'' Snyder says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was certainly helpful she won'' the marathon, Snyder adds.  
``It's like the women's World Cup. If they'd finished third, I 
don't think there would be quite as much excitement about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelson's victory in the inaugural Olympic marathon, Aug. 5,  
1984, also silenced naysayers who claimed women were physically 
incapable of running 26 miles, 385 yards, says Donna Lopiano, the 
foundation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never slowed, she never faltered. She ran with a  
determination that from beginning to end never wavered,'' Lopiano 
says. ``It closed the book on whether women were made of the right 
stuff in distance running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If her age today might seem an obstacle to a berth in the next  
year's Sydney Olympics, back then it was surgery on her right knee 
-- just 17 days before the trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelson had felt a twinge in her right knee in March 1984.  
Cortisone shots didn't help, and a month later, she could barely 
hobble through three miles. In late April, she had arthroscopic 
surgery, then a relatively new procedure. She won the trials with a 
time of 2:31:04. Three months later, she collected the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Samuelson -- who still holds the U.S. women's marathon  
record of 2:21:21, set in Chicago in 1985 -- was looking for another 
marathon, hoping to beat 2 hours, 42 minutes to qualify for the 
trials in 2000. She had a short list of cities drawn up but found 
herself in New York City over the Halloween weekend, speaking for 
Nike, the athletic equipment giant that sponsors her in running 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to enter the New York Marathon just that Sunday  
morning. She finished in 12th place -- in 2:41:06. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samuelson insists family, not the the finish line, is now  
her prime interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Running ``is not my entire life. With children and marriage  
priorities, my focus has changed,'' she says by telephone from her 
seaside home in Freeport. ``The most important thing is to have a 
healthy balance with everything you do in your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house she shares with her husband, 11-year-old daughter,  
Abby, and 9-year-old son, Anders, in Freeport is only a half hour 
up the coast from where her impressive running career began. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, she fulfilled her long-held dream of establishing a  
hometown race with the first Beach to Beacon 10K, which attracted 
thousands of world-class athletes and recreational runners. 
</P>
<P>
	The course begins near Crescent Beach State Park in her hometown  
of Cape Elizabeth and offers ocean views en route to the finish 
line at Portland Head Light. It's a route Samuelson traced many 
times while growing up and showcases some of the benchmarks of her 
career, including the high school where she began running, the 
bronze statue outside the library that honors her Olympic triumph 
and her childhood home, not far from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no name more associated with marathoning in America  
than Joan Benoit Samuelson,'' says Dave Mingey, a Nike spokesman. 
``Long before Los Angeles and long after, she was one of the most 
dominant marathoners in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is so beloved at Nike that several buildings at its  
Beaverton, Ore., headquarters are named in her honor, Mingey says. 
The company's Boston Deli recalls her two Boston Marathon wins; the 
convenience store is called Blackberries because she likes to pick 
blackberries when she visits Beaverton. Her pictures dot walls all 
over the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her work with Nike, Samuelson promotes charitable and  
athletic events and does TV ads for a Portland bank. She speaks 
frequently to schoolchildren and urges them to enjoy sports for 
themselves, not to please others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just tell all the youngsters I address to follow your heart,  
and I tell my children the same thing,'' she says. ``If there isn't 
passion, there isn't fire.''

<HEADLINE> Albright: US-China Tensions Easing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The United States and China remained at odds on  
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade but showed signs 
Sunday that their tattered relations might be on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed the Taiwan crisis must be solved quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	After a lunch meeting with the Chinese foreign minister,  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cited an ``easing of 
tensions'' and ``the restoration of communication over a very 
friendly lunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan announced that Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin has accepted President Clinton's offer to 
meet separately in New Zealand in September during an economic 
summit of Asian and Pacific nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the Taiwan question remained touchy, although Albright  
said efforts by Taiwan's president to explain his provocative 
statements suggesting sovereignty ``thus far don't quite do it,'' 
and both she and Tang urged a peaceful resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang refused to rule out force as an option, however, and  
cautioned the United States to avoid doing anything that would 
``fan the flames'' of Taiwanese independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albright-Tang meeting, held outside a conference of Asian  
leaders, was the highest-level contact between the two countries 
since the May 7 bombing in Yugoslavia that killed three Chinese 
citizens and injured more than 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Tang indicated China remains not persuaded the bombing  
was accidental despite repeated public and private assurances from 
American officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want additional reviews,'' said Albright. She said that  
even though the explanation would not change, more U.S. officials 
would go to Beijing to reiterate the U.S. position and to discuss 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	At his separate news conference, Tang said: ``The U.S.  
government should appropriately handle the Taiwan question and 
fully understand the damage the bombing incident has brought into 
this relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Albright-Tang session came at a conference of the  
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Monday, the 10 member 
nations will meet with a their more powerful partners, including 
the United States, Japan, Russia and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also met with India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh.  
They talked about recent Indian clashes with Pakistan in disputed 
Kashmir and about India's imminent elections, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over Taiwan, and the state of U.S.-Chinese  
relations, was a chief topic of conversation among leaders gathered 
for the conference, almost overshadowing talk about Asia's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	China has expressed its indignation at comments earlier this  
month by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui suggesting 
``state-to-state'' relations in the future. That appeared to 
undermine the so-called ``one-China'' policy under which the 
mainland and Taiwan have long coexisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Richard Bush, the U.S. envoy to Taiwan, made clear  
to Lee over the past few days ``that there needs to be ... a 
peaceful resolution to this and a dialogue. And I think that the 
explanations offered thus far don't quite do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a senior administration official, speaking on the  
condition of anonymity, said Lee appeared to be looking for a way 
to put his earlier statements ``in context'' to not provoke a 
confrontation. ``This is still a work in progress,'' the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long been pledged to defend Taiwan in the  
event of an invasion from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she brought up human rights issues with Tang,  
including China's recent crackdown on members of Falun Gong, an 
outlawed Buddhist-based spiritual movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did mention the fact that obviously there are sects in other  
countries that may create problems but that the right of assembly 
and the right for a peaceful expression of views is very 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she and Tang also talked about the potential  
instability that could come to the region if North Korea goes ahead 
with a second multistage missile launch, like one it launched over 
Japan last August. Some experts suggest North Korea may test a 
missile in the next month capable of reaching Alaska or Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told reporters that  
any further missile testing by North Korea ``would be a very 
serious development in regional security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuhisa Kawamura, a spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign  
Affairs, said Tokyo may suspend a $1 billion contribution to a 
North Korean nuclear energy project if the North goes ahead with 
the missile test.

<HEADLINE> Medical Journal Editor To Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) -- The editor in chief of the New England  
Journal of Medicine will step down next year because of differences 
over administrative and publishing issues, the head of the group 
that publishes the journal said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerome P. Kassirer, 66, will begin a 7-month sabbatical on Sept.  
1, concluding his contract with the journal on March 31, 2000, said 
Dr. Jack T. Evjy, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, 
which owns and publishes the journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It became evident that, despite our mutual best efforts, Dr.  
Kassirer and the Medical Society were unable to find common ground 
on these matters,'' Evjy said. 
</P>
<P>
	An interim editor would likely be announced in the next two  
weeks, according to Frank Fortin, spokesman for the Massachusetts 
Medical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortin refused to comment on what issues divided Kassirer and  
the society. 
</P>
<P>
	Envy said Kassirer achieved many accomplishments during his  
eight-year tenure at the journal. Some of those included shortening 
the turnaround time for manuscripts and bringing attention to 
critical medical developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored to have served as editor-in-chief of the New  
England Journal of Medicine and privileged to work with editors and 
staff who have never deviated from their singular focus on 
quality,'' Kassirer said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Washington Bids Farewell to Kennedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An estimated 4,500 people gathered Sunday at a  
huge Catholic church in the nation's capital to pay respects to 
John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Kennedy Bessette and Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass honoring the trio killed in an airplane crash July 16  
was held at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate 
Conception, the largest Catholic church in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy ``was a symbol of a generation coming into its own,''  
said the Rev. William E. Lori, Auxiliary Bishop of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``He revered his famous father, shared the life of his famous  
family, yet carved out a path all his own,'' Lori said during the 
homily. ``Carolyn and Lauren, while not so completely in the 
spotlight, were women of accomplishment in their own right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Holmes Norton, District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate  
to the House of Representatives, said she came to the mass because 
Washington ``in many ways is Kennedy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just John F. Kennedy, but this family changed this town,''  
Norton said. ``They came to a Southern town -- not terribly 
cosmopolitan. When they left, they left a world-class city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending was the capital city's mayor, Anthony Williams.  
``Our city represents very much a national service, as well as on 
the local level,'' Williams said. ``John Kennedy contributed to 
that tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mass drew Washingtonians as well as tourists from across the  
country. Some audience members were moved to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been grieving all week. This will bring some closure,''  
said Trudy Gallager, 60, of Falls Church in suburban Virginia. 
``When you grew up in my day, you were told if you were a woman or 
Catholic, you couldn't be president. John Kennedy began to break 
through that.''

<HEADLINE> Limb Snaps From Tree, Kills Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY VILLAGE, Ohio (AP) -- A large tree limb fell about 35 feet  
onto a table and killed three people attending a backyard picnic, 
police and firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear what caused the limb to snap around 9 p.m.  
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not raining and there was no thunder, but there was  
some wind,'' Police Chief David Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said 40 mph winds were reported  
about 7 p.m., but no strong winds were reported at the time of the 
accident in the suburb west of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The tree limb, about 1 1/2 feet to 2 feet in diameter and 35 feet  
long, was so large four men couldn't lift it, said Timothy 
McDonough, who lives on an adjacent street and was walking by when 
he heard the limb crash. 
</P>
<P>
	A 46-year-old woman died at the scene, a 30-year-old man died en  
route to St. John West Shore Hospital and a 32-year-old man died 
shortly after arriving at Lakewood hospital, police and nursing 
supervisors said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japanese Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen in  
morning trading Monday, while Japanese stocks rebounded from 
Friday's decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 116.92 yen as of midmorning, up 0.06 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
116.55 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average wiped away most of  
Friday's declines, ending the morning trading session up 128.78 
points, or 0.73 percent, at 17,663.32. On Friday, the average 
closed down 195.90 points, or 1.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar added to last week's gains on speculative buying by  
dealers aiming to capitalize on any further dollar-supportive 
intervention by Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened in recent weeks to stem the  
yen's rapid rise against the greenback as part of Japanese 
financial authorities' attempts to help the nation's fledging 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains in the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while cutting the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.42 yen, up from  
122.64 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose as investors looked for  
bargains following a sharp drop in the Nikkei late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronics giant Sony Corp. was among the early gainers as  
investors used last week's 10 percent fall in share price as a 
chance to increase their holdings in one of the country's top 
manufacturers and exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 9.05 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,445.54. The 
TOPIX closed down 22.53 points, or 1.54 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond traded unchanged at 1.685 percent. It cost 100.90 yen.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge approved a $3.3 million  
settlement for 1,800 employees of a nationwide discount brokerage 
firm who said they were required to work through lunch in exchange 
for a sandwich, a drink and chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed last October, sought to recover unpaid salaries  
and overtime for past and present telephone brokers at New 
York-based Waterhouse Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which followed several months of negotiations,  
was approved Friday by U.S. District Judge Charles Legge. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the employees will get as much as $3,750 from the  
settlement, and assistant managers will get half that amount, said 
Michael Rubin, a lawyer for the employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the suit, Waterhouse argued that the brokers were  
required to take their overtime claims individually to a New York 
Stock Exchange arbitration board, rather than suing as a group in 
court, under agreements that all brokers are required to sign when 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees' lawyers argued that federal overtime law entitled  
an aggrieved worker to go to court. The Clinton administration's 
Labor Department filed arguments supporting the employees on the 
arbitration issue, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> TV Commentator Agronsky Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime television commentator Martin  
Agronsky, a voice from radio's golden age who helped pioneer the 
``talking heads'' television news format and retired in 1988 as 
popular as he ever was, died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 84.  
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky began in newspaper journalism, became a war  
correspondent on radio, then from 1943 until he retired in 1988 was 
a Washington correspondent, foreign correspondent and commentator 
for U.S. television. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky's son David Agronsky said his father died at his  
Washington home of congestive heart failure. Stricken by a massive 
heart attack in early June, Agronsky recently returned home after a 
lengthy hospitalization, his son said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've been one of the few people who fought the battle for  
the news and for seriousness against commercialism and schlock,'' 
commentator Tom Oliphant, a permanent panelist, told Agronsky as he 
ended his syndicated television program ``Agronsky &AMP; Company'' at 
the beginning of 1988 after an 18-year run. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which began as a newscast on Washington's WTOP-TV, now  
WUSA-TV, was among the first to use the informal format of 
reporters talking among themselves rather than interviewing 
newsmakers. Agronsky described it as a bull session among 
first-class reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The format, generally with newsmakers participating, became the  
stock-in-trade of today's Sunday talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agronsky &AMP; Company'' ran less than a year as a local newscast,  
but the concept was spun off into a program syndicated on 
commercial and public television stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Penner, director of the San Diego Press Club and host of  
a program on a San Diego public radio station, worked for Agronsky 
for three years in the 1950s, when he worked on NBC's ``Today'' 
show, then hosted by Dave Garroway. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky ``was a perfectionist, sexist, macho, and he knew  
everybody,'' Penner told an interviewer for an Internet profile. 
``It was the toughest three years anybody could have in what was 
really an apprentice position. ... A lot of what I do today I do 
because I was so well-trained by Agronsky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Zama Agronsky was born Jan. 12, 1915, in Philadelphia, a  
son of Russian Jewish immigrants. His first job was in 1936 as 
general assignment reporter for the Palestine Post, now the 
Jerusalem Post. Before he retired, he had worked for all three 
major networks and PBS, generally in high-profile positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agronsky &AMP; Company'' was the nation's top-ranked public  
affairs program when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	His son said Agronsky's proudest accomplishment was winning the  
1952 Peabody Award for distinguished reporting for his work at ABC 
on the excesses of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's efforts to weed 
communists out of U.S. society. He broadcast his commentary each 
morning from a studio above a downtown Washington drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lost at least half his sponsors, if not more,'' David  
Agronsky said. Every day's mail brought more expressions of hate, 
casting aspersions on his Jewish roots, ``calling him a commie, a 
traitor,'' Agronsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of the turmoil, he said, his dad was summoned to  
New York. ``He thought he was going to be canned,'' Agronsky said. 
``Instead, they congratulated him and took him to lunch.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Martin Agronsky's proudest accomplishment,  
says his son, was winning the 1952 Peabody Award for distinguished 
broadcast reporting for his work on the excesses by Sen. Joseph 
McCarthy as he tried to cleanse U.S. society of communists.

<HEADLINE> New Gene Tailoring Technique / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Corn that resists pesticides and herbicides.  
Soybeans that are heart-healthy like olive oil. Coffee beans that 
don't need to have caffeine removed because they're genetically 
programmed to grow with less caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
	All are possibilities from a new gene-altering technique known  
as chimeraplasty, billed as a potential treatment for up to 80 
percent of human genetic diseases, but also showing promise in 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique could lead to more accurate modifications to crops  
and faster delivery of new seeds to farmers while also alleviating 
some of the problems associated with genetically altered crops, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be much faster, first for the farmers to see a  
benefit and then the consumers to see a benefit,'' said Charles J. 
Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant 
Research at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Arntzen conducted the research on corn with Kimeragen Inc. of  
suburban Philadelphia and Pioneer Hi-Bred International of 
Johnston, Iowa. Two articles on the research were published last 
week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant research was a direct spinoff of studies involving  
human gene therapy and the Amish, who have a higher-than-normal 
rate of genetic diseases, Arntzen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In humans, we're usually trying to correct a defective gene,''  
he said. Defective genes in plants, however, are thrown away and 
replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chimeraplasty allows scientists to replace small components of  
genes in specific areas. The research showed that plant resistance 
to a commonly used herbicide could be mutated into the genes of 
corn and the changes were inherited by a second generation of 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could insert traits in a more accurate way that we haven't  
had tools to do so in the past,'' said Donna Ramaeker Zahn, 
research communications manager for Pioneer Hi-Bred. She said the 
first seeds made with the technique should be available to farmers 
in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arntzen said the new technique could cut the total time required  
to bring a new genetically engineered seed to farmers to three to 
five years. Using the traditional methods, eight years would be a 
typical timeline, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The old method of genetically altering crops meant inserting a  
gene from another plant. The new plant had to be bred for a few 
generations to ensure the foreign gene had inserted properly, said 
Peter R. Beetham, a Kimeragen scientist. For example, the bacterial 
gene Bt has been inserted into corn and cotton to make the plants 
resist bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new method, however, uses nature's own ability to mutate to  
change the genes of the crop plant instead of adding a foreign 
gene. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a way for having these changes occur at will rather  
than waiting for nature to do them,'' said Mike Blaese, Kimeragen's 
science director. 
</P>
<P>
	Peggy Lemaux, the head of a genetic engineering lab at the  
University of California, Berkeley, said the new technique should 
be valuable for selecting easy-to-spot traits in crops such as 
herbicide resistance. But she cautioned that more work needs to be 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Science has yet to improve nutritional value, but this research  
may help, she said.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Muse Chance of 'Three-Peat' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Rod Smith has temporarily traded his  
traditional No. 80 practice jersey for No. 3 to remind his 
teammates of their potential place in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Romanowski and Glenn Cadrez walked to lunch Sunday wearing  
T-shirts emblazoned with the words, ``Back to back to BACK.'' John 
Mobley arrived at training camp and promptly boasted ``Time for No. 
3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of winning an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl is  
hardly taboo among the Denver Broncos. In fact, it's motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you come in and say, `We want to make the playoffs,' hell,  
you might as well not even play,'' Smith said. ``The thing is to 
win the Super Bowl. It just so happens that we're going for three 
in a row. It's something special, something that's never been done. 
Why wouldn't you want to address that? I'm not coming out here to 
go 7-9. I'm out here to win it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The straightforward approach is a contrast to last year when  
Denver was pursuing a different piece of history. The Broncos won 
their first 13 games and tried to deflect all questions of joining 
the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only team to finish the season 
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions became moot when the New York Giants upset the  
Broncos in their bid for victory No. 14, but the prospect of being 
the first team to win three straight Super Bowls has led to a new 
buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, it's in the back of your head,'' said defensive  
end Harald Hasselbach. ``You never like to talk about `three-peat,' 
but it's in your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winning three straight titles would not be a first in the NFL.  
Green Bay captured the NFL championship in 1965 and then won the 
first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967. The Packers also finished 
as NFL champs from 1929-31. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's quest is slightly more difficult considering there were  
24 teams in the NFL and AFL 33 years ago. The Broncos will have to 
emerge from a 31-team field this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day people talk to us about the possibility to do  
something that no one else has ever done,'' head coach Mike 
Shanahan said. ``It's obviously there, but we understand that you 
don't win championships by talking about what's going to be done at 
the end of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from retired quarterback John Elway, the Broncos have a  
chance to win their third straight title with virtually the same 
lineup that pounded Atlanta in January and surprised Green Bay a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Their personnel situation is similar to the Buffalo Bills, who  
made it to four straight Super Bowls in the '90s. Of course, the 
Bills made dubious history by losing all four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of look at their little run of four years straight,''  
running back Terrell Davis said. ``Had they won those four games 
... they would have been the only team to do it, so it's 
possible.''

<HEADLINE> Rogers Introduced, Beltran Demoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In his first attempt at pitching with a New York  
baseball team, Kenny Rogers had a mediocre record with the Yankees. 
He's confident things will change with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little different because it's the National League  
and I've never been a National League pitcher before,'' Rogers said 
Sunday. ``But when I'm healthy I've proven that I'm a pretty good 
pitcher. ... one of the best in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, 34, who was 5-3 with a 4.30 ERA in 19 starts with  
Oakland this year, was traded to the Mets on Friday for minor 
leaguers Terrence Long and Leoner Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
	In his two seasons with the Yankees in 1996 and 1997, Rogers was  
18-15 with a 5.16 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first year I thought I was pretty good,'' Rogers said,  
referring to the 1996 season when he was 12-8 with a 4.68 ERA in 30 
starts. ``But I look at it for myself because I want to do better 
here. The key is staying healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions varied on Rogers' effort in New York two seasons ago.  
Some thought he was pitching with a bad shoulder, while others 
believed he felt too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a little too coincidental to say there was too  
much pressure,'' Rogers said. ``My second year, I was pretty much 
in limbo for most of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Rogers on their 25-man roster, the Mets  
optioned left-handed reliever Rigo Beltran to Triple-A Norfolk 
before the start of Sunday night's game with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Rogers was 16-8 with an 11-0 record at the Oakland  
Coliseum, becoming the first pitcher to go undefeated at home since 
Tommy Green was 10-0 at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	With his trade to the Mets, the left-hander rejoined manger  
Bobby Valentine, who managed Rogers during his first season in the 
majors with Texas in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he planned to give Rogers his first start  
Wednesday, when the Mets conclude a three-game series with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go out and do something like this, you want to make  
sure it fits,'' Valentine said. ``I think he'll fit. He's a good 
athlete and he knows how to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are looking for another pitcher to come out of the  
bullpen, but are satisfied with what Rogers might be able to give 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Rogers) is a quality left-handed pitcher,'' said Mets  
outfielder Brian McRae. ``There aren't a lot of lefties out there 
who are durable and can give you a lot of innings like he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beltran was 1-1 with a 3.48 ERA in 21 appearances with the Mets  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy when I heard (the Mets) got another starter,''  
said Beltran, who had been demoted to the minors three times before 
Sunday. ``But it's tough for me because I feel like I was doing the 
job here.''

<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Clint Mathis and Ezra Hendrickson scored  
21 minutes apart as the Los Angeles Galaxy edged the Kansas City 
Wizards 2-1 on Sunday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis scored 22 seconds into the match -- the fourth-fastest  
goal in Major League Soccer history -- and Hendrickson followed with 
a goal 21 minutes later to give the Galaxy a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 35th minute, Alex Bunbury pulled the Wizards within 2-1  
when his shot from the penalty area bounced off the hands of Los 
Angeles goalkeeper Kevin Hartman and into the goal. It was 
Bunbury's third goal in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards had three strong chances to tie the score in the  
final 12 minutes. Shots by Bunbury and Chris Klein hit the crossbar 
in the 78th and 86th minutes, respectively, and a free kick by 
Preki in the 80th minute sailed just wide of the right goal post. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman made one save as the Galaxy won for the sixth time in  
seven matches, moving within a point of Chicago and Dallas for 
second place in the Western Conference.

half-century mark, but that doesn't make him feel old. He sees the 
milestone as a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels fine,'' Gere says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I'm

<HEADLINE> 39-year-old Johnny Gray Wins 800 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- With Princess Anne in attendance,  
Johnny Gray performed royally and regally. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Gray shook off questions about his age and a  
younger Norberto Tellez of Cuba to win the 800 meters at the Pan 
American Games on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public dwells in your head that you're too old and you're  
supposed to believe it,'' Gray said. ``I don't. To have held up the 
way I did today shows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dogged Tellez, 27, matched Gray stride-for-stride down the  
final straightaway. At the end, it was Gray's lean that gave him 
the edge by .02 seconds in a season-best and games record 1:45.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the judges took a couple of minutes to determine the  
winner, Gray began his victory lap around the packed University of 
Manitoba stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my experience, you take the victory lap and they'll give  
it to you,'' Gray said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Gray's second Pan Am title; his first was in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a better runner and in better shape than I was then,'' he  
said. ``I struggled to run 1:46 then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the elder statesmen of the sport, Gray is held in awe by  
many of the younger runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, `Mr. Gray, it's an honor to line up with you,' '' he  
said. '' `I was 7 years old when I saw you in the 1984 Olympic 
Games. Because of you guys (the media) saying that I'm 39, I can't 
tell them that I'm 29 anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has been in four Olympics, winning the bronze medal in  
1992. He had not run as well this year because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great that I had that test today, because now I know  
I'm ready,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Cuba's delegation claimed its athletes are being  
encouraged to defect through the Canadian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a Cuban athlete and a journalist have defected, and  
Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, 
said ``our delegation is very upset about publications inciting 
Cuban athletes to desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before the  
games. Sources said Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has sought 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are annoyed by stories that have appeared in the  
Winnipeg Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' Fernandez said. ``The Cuban delegation 
does not accept these methods, which are contrary to the spirit of 
friendship and hospitality with which the Canadian people have 
received us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was most angry about a statement signed by Enrico  
Blanco, a boxer who left Cuba in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is here now, inciting desertion,'' Fernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bernard Williams ended the 12-year U.S. drought in  
the men's 100. Tim Harden, the more heralded of the two Americans 
in the 100, was last out of the blocks and never compltely 
recovered, finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra Sturrup gave the Bahamas its first-ever Pan Am track  
gold, overtaking NCAA champion Angela Williams of Southern 
California to win the women's 100 in 11.10. Sturrup trains with 
Marion Jones, the world's No. 1 sprinter, at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams nearly didn't run. She aggravated a hamstring while  
warming up and the U.S. team trainer told her not to compete. 
</P>

	Chris Huffins, the two-time U.S. champion in the decathlon, set  
a games record in beating teammate Daniel Steele by 100 points with 
a score of 8,170 points. The score was one of Huffins' worst in 
years, and he blamed it on the officials, claiming some races were 
run in the wrong wind direction to accommodate television. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they did for the cameras didn't help the scores at all,''  
he said. ``My score is not indicative of the efforts I put in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's career-best 8,070 qualified him for next month's world  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men's winners were Jamaica's Greg Haughton in the 400;  
Vanderlei Lima of Brazil in the marathon; and Joel Bourgeois of 
Canada in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other women's events, Letitia Vriesde won the 800 for  
Surinam's first-ever track and field gold at the games, upsetting 
American Meredith Rainey Valmon; Mexico's Ana Guevera took the 400; 
Erika Olivera became the first Chilean marathoner to win a Pan Am 
medal with a games record 2:37:41; Mexico's Adriana Fernandez won 
her second straight 5,000 title; Argentina's Alejandra Garcia took 
the games' first pole vault for women; and Osleidys Menendez of 
Cuba won the javelin at 216-0, also a Pan Am record.

	U.S. men's track coach Ralph Lindeman, 48, was hospitalized  
Saturday night with chest pains. Dr. Dan Carr, had physician at the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Two Golds in Greco-Roman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Champions Dennis Hall and Matt  
Lindblad led a U.S. parade to the medal stand Sunday night in 
Greco-Roman wrestling at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	All eight American wrestlers won medals, collecting two golds,  
four silvers and two bronzes. It was the seventh straight time the 
United States won medals in every weight class at the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall claimed his second Pan Ams gold medal when he pinned  
Roberto Monzon of Cuba in 2 minutes, 39 seconds at 58 kilograms. 
That topped off an outstanding day for Hall, who pinned Canada's 
Mike Francis in 2:44 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	In the finals, Hall was trailing 2-0 when he stepped over an  
attempted gut wrench by Monzon and suddenly pinned him. Hall also 
won a gold medal at the 1995 Pan Am Games and was the Olympic 
silver medalist in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are good friends with the Cubans, but it is war when we  
wrestle,'' Hall said. ``He's a tough competitor. I beat him, but 
not soundly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindblad took the gold at 76 kilograms with an 8-1 victory over  
Cuba's Filberto Azcuy, the 1996 Olympic champion. Azcuy defeated 
Lindblad 7-3 at a meet in California two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wrestled six of that hardest minutes of my life,''  
Lindblad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans won the gold medal in the six other weight classes and  
got a silver in the two others. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' silver medalists were David Zuniga (69  
kilograms), Quincey Clark (85 kilograms), Jason Klohs (97 
kilograms) and Dremiel Byers (130 kilograms). Steven Mays (54 
kilograms) and Glenn Nieradka (63 kilograms) won bronze medals.

<HEADLINE> Albright: US-China Tensions Easing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The United States and China remained at odds on  
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade but showed signs 
Sunday that their tattered relations might be on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	They also agreed the Taiwan crisis must be solved quickly.  
</P>
<P>
	After a lunch meeting with the Chinese foreign minister,  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright cited an ``easing of 
tensions'' and ``the restoration of communication over a very 
friendly lunch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan announced that Chinese  
President Jiang Zemin has accepted President Clinton's offer to 
meet separately in New Zealand in September during an economic 
summit of Asian and Pacific nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the Taiwan question remained touchy, although Albright  
said efforts by Taiwan's president to explain his provocative 
statements suggesting sovereignty ``thus far don't quite do it,'' 
and both she and Tang urged a peaceful resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang refused to rule out force as an option, however, and  
cautioned the United States to avoid doing anything that would 
``fan the flames'' of Taiwanese independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albright-Tang meeting, held outside a conference of Asian  
leaders, was the highest-level contact between the two countries 
since the May 7 bombing in Yugoslavia that killed three Chinese 
citizens and injured more than 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Tang indicated China remains not persuaded the bombing  
was accidental despite repeated public and private assurances from 
American officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want additional reviews,'' said Albright. She said that  
even though the explanation would not change, more U.S. officials 
would go to Beijing to reiterate the U.S. position and to discuss 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	At his separate news conference, Tang said: ``The U.S.  
government should appropriately handle the Taiwan question and 
fully understand the damage the bombing incident has brought into 
this relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Albright-Tang session came at a conference of the  
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Monday, the 10 member 
nations will meet with a their more powerful partners, including 
the United States, Japan, Russia and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also met with India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh.  
They talked about recent Indian clashes with Pakistan in disputed 
Kashmir and about India's imminent elections, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over Taiwan, and the state of U.S.-Chinese  
relations, was a chief topic of conversation among leaders gathered 
for the conference, almost overshadowing talk about Asia's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	China has expressed its indignation at comments earlier this  
month by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui suggesting 
``state-to-state'' relations in the future. That appeared to 
undermine the so-called ``one-China'' policy under which the 
mainland and Taiwan have long coexisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said Richard Bush, the U.S. envoy to Taiwan, made clear  
to Lee over the past few days ``that there needs to be ... a 
peaceful resolution to this and a dialogue. And I think that the 
explanations offered thus far don't quite do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a senior administration official, speaking on the  
condition of anonymity, said Lee appeared to be looking for a way 
to put his earlier statements ``in context'' to not provoke a 
confrontation. ``This is still a work in progress,'' the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long been pledged to defend Taiwan in the  
event of an invasion from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she brought up human rights issues with Tang,  
including China's recent crackdown on members of Falun Gong, an 
outlawed Buddhist-based spiritual movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did mention the fact that obviously there are sects in other  
countries that may create problems but that the right of assembly 
and the right for a peaceful expression of views is very 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she and Tang also talked about the potential  
instability that could come to the region if North Korea goes ahead 
with a second multistage missile launch, like one it launched over 
Japan last August. Some experts suggest North Korea may test a 
missile in the next month capable of reaching Alaska or Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told reporters that  
any further missile testing by North Korea ``would be a very 
serious development in regional security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuhisa Kawamura, a spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign  
Affairs, said Tokyo may suspend a $1 billion contribution to a 
North Korean nuclear energy project if the North goes ahead with 
the missile test.

<HEADLINE> Piniella, Segui Ejected From Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Seattle manager Lou Piniella was ejected in  
the fifth inning of Sunday's game at Minnesota for arguing an 
appeal call by third-base umpire Durwood Merril. 
</P>
<P>
	One inning later, Mariners first baseman David Segui was tossed  
by home plate ump Mike Everitt. Segui had been brushed back by 
Twins pitcher Brad Radke before flying out and was ejected for 
yelling at Everitt after returning to the Seattle bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella was tossed after throwing his cap while arguing that  
Raul Ibanez had not left third base early on an apparent sacrifice 
fly by Ken Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle already ahead 4-0, Ibanez appeared to have scored  
from third on Griffey's sacrifice fly. But Minnesota appealed the 
play and Merril made the out call for an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	In his anger, Piniella attempted to lift up third base but  
couldn't, so he kicked dirt on the base instead. When he returned 
to the dugout, he threw several bats onto the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Piniella has been ejected this season. The  
Mariners had lost three straight and 11 of their past 18 entering 
the game.

<HEADLINE> Photos Upset 'Dawson's Creek' Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michelle Williams has appeared on stage totally  
naked and has been on her own since age 15. On top of that, she 
plays a bad girl on ``Dawson's Creek.'' Still, when the teen-age 
actress saw a sexy photo of her on a magazine cover, she was 
horrified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those pictures are not me,'' Williams says in Sunday's Daily  
News, referring to the cover shot and other photos in Maxim 
magazine. ``You should see me in flannel pajamas and greasy hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It upsets me to see those pictures. I hate the fact that the  
girls who watch `Dawson's Creek' will see them. I have a 
15-year-old sister. I don't want to be an unhealthy role model. I 
don't want to see girls like me trivialized and sexualized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 18, moved to Los Angeles from San Diego -- alone -- to  
pursue her acting career, having graduated from high school at age 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the `from-birth-to-16-year-old' blues. It was a  
perpetual mood in my life,'' she said. ``So I moved out. I don't 
know if I was ready, but I was determined.''

	RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Leaders from about 30 countries streamed  
into Morocco today for the funeral of King Hassan II, hailed as a 
peacemaker and anchor of the Arab world, while Moroccans arrived in 
droves to mourn their monarch and spiritual leader. President 
Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli President 
Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak are among those 
attending this afternoon's funeral, expected to last six hours. The 
ceremony began with Koranic readings by the coffin in an ornate

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- In the first test of the new Israeli  
government's settlement policy, Prime Minister Ehud Barak ordered 
the dismantling of mobile homes set up illegally at a West Bank 
Jewish settlement, his office said today. Five mobile homes were 
dismantled by the army late last night and early this morning after 
they were set up yesterday about 20 miles north of Jerusalem. The 
future of the 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip is to be discussed in talks on a permanent peace agreement. 
The Palestinians have said they expect Barak to freeze settlement 
building until the settlements' fate is determined.

Serbs. U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner said tomorrow's meeting 
had been postponed, granting a Serb request. A Serb spokesman said 
the request was made to allow the Serbs to bury the victims. NATO 
troops today searched for the killers of the Serb farmers. 
Peacekeepers stepped up patrols in and around Gracko, the central 
Kosovo farming community where the men were killed by automatic 
weapons fire.

newspaper reported today. Wen Wei Po and several independent Hong 
Kong newspapers also reported that the People's Liberation Army

onto a table and killed three people attending a backyard picnic 
last night, police said. It is unclear what caused the limb to 
snap. The National Weather Service said no strong winds were 
reported at the time of the accident in the suburb west of 
Cleveland. The tree limb, about 1 1/2 feet to 2 feet in diameter and 
35 feet long, was so large four men couldn't lift it. A 46-year-old 
woman died at the scene, a 30-year-old man died en route to St.

today they have reached a tentative trade agreement. The deal, 
which comes after three years of wrangling, still requires approval 
by the U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly. It's 
considered the last major step in normalizing relations following

<HEADLINE> End of Kennedy Search Was a Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Hall had just fallen asleep early  
Wednesday when the telephone rang in his hotel room in Falmouth, 
Mass. Shaking off fatigue from the four-day search for John F. 
Kennedy Jr. and two others, he picked up the receiver and heard the 
voice of his chief crash investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've found a big piece of the airplane,'' Robert Pearce  
told the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
Pearce had just been called on a secure phone line from the USS 
Grasp, which made the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the beginning of the end of a high-pressure search for  
Kennedy, the son of the nation's 35th president, his wife, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette. All three were 
aboard Kennedy's red-and-white Piper Saratoga when it plunged into 
the waters southwest of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., about 9:40 p.m. 
on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The end came five days later, when divers unstrapped Kennedy and  
the sisters from their seats in the plane, put the bodies in body 
bags and brought them to the surface. The remains were then placed 
in aluminum transfer cases, which have the crisp look of military 
caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and his two sons escorted all  
three to land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted those kids to come home with some dignity,'' said one  
person closely involved in the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on interviews with Hall and other government officials,  
The Associated Press has been able to reconstruct the conclusion of 
a search that transfixed two families, and much of America. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy took off in his single-engine airplane from Fairfield,  
N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on July 16. He intended to fly to Martha's 
Vineyard to drop off his 34-year-old sister-in-law to visit 
friends. Kennedy, 38, and his wife, 33, were then to fly on to 
Hyannis, Mass., where they were to be guests the next day at the 
wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of the late 
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	One hour and two minutes into the flight, the airplane went into  
a dive, slipped beneath radar coverage and crashed into the sea 
about 7 1/2 miles off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy won his pilot's license little more than a year earlier.  
He was not rated to fly just with instruments. Veteran pilots and 
flight instructors speculate that he may have become disoriented 
flying in the dark and the haze. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration went to work. It collected  
radar readouts from throughout the region and sent the printouts 
and computer tapes to the safety board. In Washington, analysts fed 
the data into computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates about where the plane crashed were relayed to ships  
and planes operated by Coast Guard, Air National Guard, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Civil Air Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	At 9:45 p.m. on July 18, however, the head of the search and  
rescue effort, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, told a 
news conference that there was no hope of survivors. He said the 
would-be rescuers would now support the safety board with wreckage 
recovery and its accident investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did everything we possibly could to find survivors,''  
Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working through the night on Monday, NTSB performance analyst  
Dan Bowers and aeronautical engineer John Clark narrowed the search 
area to a projected ``splash point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday morning I was optimistic,'' said Hall. ``I thought  
that day was going to be the day we recovered the wreckage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy laid a grid over Bowers and Clark's splash point. Three  
sonar-equipped ships started a crisscross pattern, coming up with 
10 targets on the ocean floor. With a remote-controlled camera, the 
Navy checked the sites one by one. The first five were not airplane 
wreckage; one particularly promising piece turned out to be an 
anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dejection.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, you knew about the anxiety of the families and,  
of course, the many, many people around the world who were paying 
attention to this,'' Hall recalled. ``You always know there is a 
possibility that you can do all of this and not be able to find the 
wreckage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Hall watched the 11 o'clock news and then went to  
bed. About 11:40 p.m., a submersible from the Grasp came across the 
plane's wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief investigator Pearce was at the Coast Guard command center  
at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. He had been sleeping there each 
night. Suddenly, his phone jingled with the news from the Grasp. He 
called Hall shortly after midnight, and notifications continued up 
and down the line -- including to the Kennedy and Bessette families. 
</P>
<P>
	The success, however, was incomplete. While Kennedy's body was  
plainly visible, the remote TV camera could not locate the sisters. 
Divers would have to finish the search. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	When Kennedy's plane went missing, the news reverberated through  
the nation and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, the  
presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains, was told upon 
awakening. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, married to another of 
Robert Kennedy's daughters, pleaded to his colleagues that the 
government not appear to overreact. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the secretary of transportation, the head of the  
Coast Guard and the chief of the Federal Aviation Administration 
were kept abreast of the search. 
</P>
<P>
	All denied that a celebrity like Kennedy was getting special  
treatment, but Clinton said at a news conference on Wednesday the 
family had sustained ``enormous losses'' on behalf of the country 
and he agreed to give extra time to complete the search. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the news media at a distance, the FAA instituted  
unprecedented airspace restrictions around the search area. Once 
the wreckage was discovered and the bodies located, the 
restrictions were increased to keep any aircraft at least five 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA found that some pilots promptly violated the  
restrictions by turning off equipment relaying their aircraft's 
identification information to air traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall recalled seeing such a swarm of reporters only once before:  
the July 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800. By coincidence, Hall and his 
top assistants were on Long Island when Kennedy crashed for a 
Flight 800 memorial service, monument dedication and investigation 
update. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing made Hall and Larrabee especially concerned about the  
Kennedy and Bessette families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is extremely important to the American system that  
we all enjoy, and it's extremely important that the media have 
information,'' Hall said. ``But when the media causes pain and 
suffering on families at a time of grief, that kind of behavior 
should not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 10:40 a.m. Wednesday, the Grasp was able to send down two  
divers. Arriving at the wreckage site some 116 feet under the 
surface, they were quickly able to locate the Bessette sisters amid 
the twisted metal. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery of the bodies wouldn't come until the afternoon,  
after the arrival of Kennedy and his sons Edward Jr. and Patrick, a 
congressman from Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking hours later at a news conference, Larrabee lamented  
that what started as a search and rescue mission early on July 18 
ended Wednesday with a confirmation of death. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think today,'' Larrabee said, looking into the glare of  
television cameras, ``that we were able to bring closure to two 
families, and I think that we realize is very important, and so I 
think this evening we can feel relatively good about our work.''

<HEADLINE> Shuttle May Have Leaked Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- One of space shuttle Columbia's main  
engines may have been leaking hydrogen fuel all the way to orbit 
and could have shut down abruptly if more fuel had seeped out, 
resulting in a never-before-attempted emergency landing, NASA said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	If it proves to be a leak as photographs suggest, the possible  
engine shut down could have caused an emergency landing within 
minutes of launch, either in Florida or West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Columbia made it safely to orbit Friday under  
the control of Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to 
command a U.S. spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle, carrying five astronauts and the world's biggest  
and most powerful X-ray telescope, fell seven miles short of its 
intended orbit. A fuel leak could explain why the engines shut down 
one second or so early. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's mission operations representative, Wayne Hale, stressed  
there is no proof that one or two cooling tubes in the nozzle of 
the right engine were cracked and leaking hydrogen. Until the 
shuttle returns to Earth on Tuesday night and the engine is 
examined, no one will know for sure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, when you're dealing with main engines, and they  
have a lot of energy flowing through that system, you want them to 
operate exactly down the middle of the pike because bad things 
might happen,'' Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think this is a case that even approaches that.''  
</P>
<P>
	Hydrogen has leaked from cracked tubes in engine nozzles during  
a couple other shuttle launches, but at a smaller rate than appears 
to have happened this time, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference, Hale showed a video frame of Columbia  
10 to 15 seconds after liftoff. A bright streak was clearly visible 
on the inside of the right engine nozzle. The two other engine 
nozzles were spotless. 
</P>
<P>
	The cooling tubes, if split, would have begun leaking one or two  
seconds before liftoff and continued leaking throughout the 
8 1/2-minute climb to orbit, Hale said. He estimated the potential 
leak rate at 3 pounds to 5 pounds of hydrogen per second -- ``not a 
lot of flow'' -- which would be equivalent to, at most, two broken 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	Each engine nozzle has more than 1,000 of these slender steel  
tubes through which hydrogen flows to cool the bell-shaped nozzle 
and also to preheat the super-cold hydrogen fuel to improve engine 
efficiency. The circulating hydrogen comes from the giant external 
fuel tank strapped to the shuttle and flows directly into the 
engine combustion chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem -- whatever it was -- was unrelated to the short  
circuit that occurred five seconds into Columbia's flight. The 
prime controllers on two of the three main engines were knocked out 
by the half-second short, and the backup controllers kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins discovered a popped circuit breaker aboard Columbia late  
Saturday, which leads NASA to believe the short occurred either in 
the engine controller or in the electrical wiring that leads to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the three main engines are not used after propelling the  
shuttle into orbit, neither problem will affect the rest of 
Columbia's five-day flight, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins and her crew went about their business Sunday,  
conducting science experiments and chatting by ham radio with the 
three cosmonauts on Mir, as flight controllers in Massachusetts 
kept track of the free-flying Chandra X-ray Observatory and flight 
controllers in Houston pored over the shuttle engine data. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always risk in space flight,'' Collins told a radio  
interviewer. ``Our job is to minimize the risk.''

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Pledges To Restructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The head of ailing Daewoo group  
pledged to faithfully carry out a restructuring to regain trust 
from markets and investors in the conglomerate, which produces 
goods as diverse as ships, cars, electronics, clothes and 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daewoo will complete restructuring by the end of this year as  
promised, with cooperation from creditors, through objective and 
transparent procedure,'' chairman Kim Woo-choong said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were made at a press conference, which was hurriedly  
arranged one day after Economy and Finance Minister Kang Bong-kyun 
said Daewoo has to accelerate selling off assets to resolve its 
cash shortage or it could drag down the entire economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said there have been unfounded rumors about the size of  
Daewoo's debts. He added that as of late June, Daewoo affiliates at 
home had a total of $40.8 billion in debts and its overseas units 
collectively had $6.84 billion in foreign-currency denominated 
loans. That compares to an estimated $65 billion in total assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government said the central bank of Korea will  
supply up to $16.7 billion in emergency funds to investment trust 
companies in case they face problems because of a possible massive 
selloff of stock and bonds by small investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan aims to keep a key short-term interest rate from rising  
above the current 4.8 percent. Experts say higher interest rates 
could cause investors to pull money out of stock and other markets 
and hinder the ongoing restructuring at the nation's large 
conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made after an emergency meeting among the  
government's top economic officials including the heads of the 
Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Financial Supervisory 
Commission and the Bank of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo narrowly escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever  
bankruptcy when creditors agreed Monday to delay repayment of $8.3 
billion in short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion 
in new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo put up $8.42 billion of stock and real estate  
as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubts persisted over Daewoo's commitment and its ability to  
carry out restructuring by selling off dozens of units within six 
months. The Korean Composite Stock Price Index plummeted 7.3 
percent on Friday, marking the third largest drop in the stock 
market's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said Daewoo will concentrate on its two  
main businesses -- the flagship trading arm Daewoo Corp. and Daewoo 
Motors, the nation's second largest carmaker -- and most of the 
other units will be sold off to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said creditors will convert unpaid loans into equity  
to lower Daewoo's debt load from the fourth quarter of this year. 
Creditors began reviewing Daewoo's collateral Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of President Kim Dae-jung has been urging South  
Korea's bloated conglomerates to slim down to improve their 
financial condition. While other conglomerates were selling assets 
and focusing on profitability, Daewoo continued to expand.

<HEADLINE> Texas Hometown Cheers Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Karl Haussmann watched on the Internet as  
Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France, and was astounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``God, this is cool,'' said Haussmann, director of the Lance  
Armstrong Foundation for cancer research. ``This is amazing. It's 
Lance, it's the comeback, it's history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haussman was in his office by 8 a.m. Sunday. The European  
broadcast of a series of still photos from the race was sometimes 
fuzzy and digitally mangled. But it would take more than that to 
spoil Haussmann's day. 
</P>
<P>
	When the race started July 3, few thought Armstrong could win  
cycling's most prestigious and rugged race. After all, the 
27-year-old rider from Austin was recovering from testicular cancer 
that had spread to his lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Armstrong has done it. He won in Paris by 7 minutes, 37  
seconds, and his adopted hometown was ready to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sweet. It's a done deal,'' Haussmann said when images of  
Armstrong on the winner's podium appeared on his screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it was kind of anticlimactic because he had such a  
big lead, I still got an adrenaline rush -- my heart beating faster 
-- thinking about him leading the race and crossing the finish 
line,'' Haussmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	To many in Austin, Armstrong is a hero.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is he a hometown hero, he's a world hero,'' said John  
Crismond, who watched ABC's tape-delayed afternoon coverage with 
about 750 cycling enthusiasts during a party at the Copper Tank 
Brewing Co. The crowd was about 300 more than organizers expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he didn't bring those problems upon himself, but  
he's chosen to carry the banner for people with cancer,'' said 
Crismond, who like many in the crowd wore yellow shirts 
representing the Tour leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996. He had surgery to  
remove lesions from his brain and one of his testicles. He 
underwent months of chemotherapy. His doctors say there is a tiny 
chance the cancer will return. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a guy who we saw with no hair, lying in bed barely  
able to move after brain surgery, and now he's won cycling's 
greatest race,'' Haussmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the Tour de France was Greg  
LeMond, a three-time champion whose last victory came in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	By early Sunday, someone had left a basket of flowers on the  
doorstep of the Lance Armstrong Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep rolling Lance,'' read one of several messages on the  
card. ``You are an inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Austin had thought Armstrong wouldn't live to see this  
year's race, let alone win it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so sick,'' said Sally Koch, a self-described ``terrible  
biker'' but a big Armstrong fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we read about his cancer that he had, it seemed like it  
was pretty much all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jammed shoulder to shoulder in the restaurant, the crowd cheered  
every time Armstrong's face came on the television screens and 
quieted every time he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans also paused for the playing of ``The Star-Spangled  
Banner'' when Armstrong received the winner's trophy before letting 
out a final cheer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a phenomenal thing,'' said Renee Orr, who said she  
rode bicycles competitively until she had children. ``This really 
is a hometown boy done well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong lives part of the year in Austin and Nice, France. He  
will fly to New York this week for interviews before returning to 
France for several exhibition appearances, the Austin 
American-Statesman reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong will return to Austin on Aug. 10, his agent, Bill  
Stapleton, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city is planning a parade and downtown festival upon  
Armstrong's return, said Mayor Kirk Watson, himself a testicular 
cancer survivor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be emotional,'' Watson said.

<HEADLINE> New Latex Rats Used in Experiments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Lab rats, take a load off.  
</P>
<P>
	A new high-tech, hand-crafted rubber rat eventually could save  
the lives of hundreds of thousands of rodents used in laboratory 
experiments each year, say animal rights activists and the Dutch 
pharmaceutical company that developed the lifelike latex 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 rats are killed annually for educational or research  
purposes in the Netherlands alone, where rats and mice are used in 
more than 500,000 tests a year, according to the Dutch anti-animal 
research group Animal Testing Free. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Netherlands, the alternative will save a couple hundred  
rats per year, but it's about more than just the animals which will 
be saved. It is proof that there are realistic alternatives,'' said 
spokeswoman Marja Zuidgeest. 
</P>
<P>
	PVC-Rat, as the new product is called, made its debut in March  
after years of research and development. The rat is specifically 
designed for micro-surgical laboratory experiments in universities, 
hospitals and clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Although one other company makes an artificial rat used for  
practicing intravenous and oral drug administration, the PVC-Rat is 
the first alternative upon which surgical operations can be 
conducted, said chairman Rene Remie of Microsurgical Developments, 
the creation's designer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a real rat, but it's lying on its back with its  
stomach open and you can see veins and the liver and other 
organs,'' said Puck Bossert of Belgium-based Solvay 
Pharmaceuticals, the product's manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Live animals are needed to simulate life signs such as blood  
pressure, heart rate and breathing during surgery. But Bert 
Zutphen, a professor of laboratory animal science at the University 
of Utrecht, said artery stitching and nerve fusion can be practiced 
just as well on the fake rats, which can be used over and over by 
removing sutures after practice surgery, saving on laboratory 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dead rat is no good to anybody,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Medical experts believe the alternative rat -- which is made of  
recycled latex -- will replace some trials in the medical field, 
particularly those in which real rats are used in dissection to 
train university students. But they say real animals will always be 
needed for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsurgical Developments was founded in the late 1980s with  
the goal of reducing the use of animals in laboratory experiments. 
The rat is the company's first breakthrough and international 
attention has spurred demand, Solvay says. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also makes simulation software for surgery,  
plans to refine the rat to enable the performance of more intricate 
``operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each life-sized animal costs about $150 to make, but with  
government subsidies they are sold for $125, including an extra set 
of synthetic organs. Although modest sales of 750 rats are 
projected for 1999, the two companies hope such rubbery rodents one 
day will replace half of the real thing in laboratories worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Zutphen began experimenting with about 150 of the fake rats last  
year. Though they'll never completely replace live rats, he said, 
they're sufficient for introductory surgical techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	``A large portion of surgery can be learned without the use of  
real animals,'' Zutphen said, ``but they will not replace live rats 
as an essential part of laboratory research.''

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard: JFK Search Not Unusual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ron Trenton took off in a Piper Cherokee from  
San Diego's Montgomery Field and headed toward the beach, waggling 
his wings at his fellow lifeguards below. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his routine goodbye before heading out over the Pacific  
Ocean on whale-watching expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was Trenton's last goodbye. Within hours he had become  
the object of one of the hundreds of searches the Coast Guard 
conducts every year for missing planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of these draw little notice from the general public. Not so  
the extensive search for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and 
sister-in-law, and many wonder whether the government would go to 
equal lengths for someone who wasn't the celebrity son of an 
assassinated president. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton assured the country that the initial efforts  
``were consistent with what would have been done in any other 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a review of rescue and recovery efforts in two single-engine  
airplane crashes off the California coast demonstrates the 
difficulty of setting a uniform standard for a search. Trenton's 
family has no complaints. But the sister of Robert Beach, who died 
with three friends in the other crash in question, sees a 
``difference between celebrity and civilian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, says Larry Hall of the U.S. Coast Guard, who oversaw the  
search for Beach's plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter to us if you are John F. Kennedy Jr. or John  
Q. Citizen, we are in the business of saving lives,'' Hall said. 
``We will launch whatever resources it takes. Only when we have 
ruled out any chance of a survivor, and usually it's reluctantly, 
will we suspend the search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the recovery efforts of bodies and wreckage vary, as does  
the number of people assigned to investigate the accidents, said 
Keith Holloway of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the NTSB investigated 1,907 private airplane  
accidents, including 361 fatal crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Kennedy, both pilots in the California crashes were not  
trained on instruments and were flying in less-than-desirable 
conditions. Neither filed a flight plan, nor did they signal 
possible engine problems over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	One important difference is water depth.  
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy crashed in about 180 feet of Atlantic Ocean off Martha's  
Vineyard. Beach is presumed to have gone down in 5,000 feet of 
water, and Trenton in a two-mile deep canyon on the ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, of course, want to find out what caused the plane to  
crash,'' Holloway said. ``But it has to be within realistic limits 
of what can actually be accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trenton, 51, was an experienced pilot who had logged hundreds of  
hours when he took off Feb. 11, 1997 from San Diego to Santa 
Catalina Island, 35 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	He ate lunch on the island, then headed home at about 3 p.m.,  
circling the island and climbing to 2,000 feet before heading east 
to San Diego, FAA radar records show. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 3:15 p.m., his plane began slowly descending. By 3:19  
p.m., he had disappeared from radar. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like he just coasted into the ocean,'' said his brother,  
Doug Trenton. 
</P>
<P>
	When the plane failed to arrive, a friend called authorities,  
kicking off what newspaper accounts would later call one of the 
most extensive searches in San Diego's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Using infrared radar, which detects temperature differences in  
the water, the first Coast Guard helicopter flew along Trenton's 
presumed route. Meanwhile, several boats also searched. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial search area was about 2,000 square miles, divided  
among rescuers, Lt. Drew Cromwell, a co-pilot on that first 
helicopter, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lot of ocean. You just keep going over the area, back  
and forth, back and forth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By the next morning, FAA records narrowed the area to 100 square  
miles. Four helicopters, six airplanes, five ships and two Navy 
vessels joined the search and Trenton's fellow lifeguards rented 
five more airplanes. (The first hours of the Kennedy search 
involved a Coast Guard jet, two helicopters, an Air Force C-130 as 
a command post and, later, 15 small planes and an array of boats.) 
</P>
<P>
	As in the Kennedy search, buoys with transmitters were used to  
help determine the ocean's drift. But by the end of the second day, 
hope was fading. At 56 degrees, the water temperature would be 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there are just some people who refuse to die, even when  
science says they should,'' Cromwell said. ``We hold out hope for 
those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the third day, Coast Guard officials talked to the  
family about ending the search. The pilot was probably dead, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my parents asked them to keep searching and they did -- for  
two more days. They searched for my brother with the hope he might 
be alive for five days. That's longer than they did for Kennedy,'' 
Doug Trenton said. 
</P>
<P>
	No wreckage or debris was ever found. The cause of the accident  
is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron was gone. We knew it. We grasped for five days for  
something, but rationally we knew he was gone,'' Trenton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not the case for Kathy Lanni, sister of 37-year-old  
Robert Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference between celebrity and civilian,'' she told The  
Baltimore Sun in a recent interview. ``Of course, it's unfair. But 
it's the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beach took off from Half Moon Bay in Northern California on May  
22, 1998, in a rented Piper on a moonless night. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, people reported seeing two white lights spinning  
into the ocean or hearing a splash in the water, said Paul Young, a 
member of the Auxiliary Coast Guard who interviewed the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard issued an emergency broadcast -- a message that  
would play every 30 minutes for the next three days -- asking 
boaters and pilots in the area to keep an eye out for survivors and 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard then began its rescue attempt, said Sr. Petty  
Office Guy McNabb, who oversaw the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard helicopter, two boats and a handful of people  
scoured the area in the dark, but found nothing. By the next 
morning, it looked like a false report, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	If there was a plane, radar failed to pick it up and nobody had  
reported a missing plane. It was later determined that nearby 
bluffs likely obscured radar during takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	With no indication of an accident, Hall said, he suspended the  
search. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was renewed that night when the men failed to return the  
rented airplane and a missing persons report was filed with the 
Sheriff's Department. About the same time, the Coast Guard was told 
that somebody on the beach found an airplane seat cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 24 hours, the Coast Guard launched three boats and  
two helicopters, the local harbor master used his boat, and county 
and local police deployed two boats and two airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	A piece of airplane insulation and a Walkman washed ashore on  
the third day. A severed foot in a shoe also was discovered on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was all we ever found,'' Hall said.  
</P>
<P>
	The operation was called off after three days, half a day longer  
than the Kennedy search. 
</P>
<P>
	But no recovery efforts followed, Ms. Lanni said.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't look for wreckage when they feel it's beyond  
rescue,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days after the near round-the-clock coverage of the  
search for Kennedy, Ms. Lanni said she asked herself: ``Can you 
believe what they're doing for him that they didn't do for Bob?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the celebrity situation,'' she said, adding she  
understood the effort to find Kennedy. ``It's holding the public's 
attention. Even I'm scanning the TV set.''

<HEADLINE> Fiorentina Wins Gotham Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Gabriel Batistuta scored a pair of  
goals Sunday as Fiorentina defeated Aston Villa 4-0 in the finals 
of the Gotham Cup exhibition tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Batistuta, the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, was  
supported by newcomer Predrag Mijatovic. Mijatovic had a goal, an 
assist and made a pass that set up a penalty kick by Batistuta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was not surprised with how easily we won,'' Fiorentina coach  
Giovanni Trappatoni said through an interpreter. ``We have some of 
the best players in the world. I am very satisfied with the way we 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rui Costa set up the first goal in the 19th minute when he  
threaded a diagonal lead pass to Mijatovic racing into the box from 
the left. The Serbian striker, who was acquired recently from Real 
Madrid, controlled the ball and placed a low shot just inside the 
far post. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiorentina made it 2-0 in the 36th minute on a penalty kick by  
Batistuta after Aston Villa defender Gareth Soughgate pulled him 
down in the box following a pass from Mijatovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mijatovic and Battistuta were the difference,'' said Aston  
Villa coach John Gregory. ``They taught us a lesson in finishing. 
They're forwards are the best in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batistuta tallied his second goal in the 48th minute when he ran  
onto a cross from Mijatovic on the right side and tucked a low shot 
inside the far post from 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Costa then closed the scoring in the 87th minute running onto a  
long pass from Abel Balbo and slipping the ball into the net from 
close range with the outside of his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the consolation match, Panathinaikos edged Ajox, 3-2.

<HEADLINE> 'Quiet' Kennedy Has Leadership Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- In a family known for glamour, adventure  
and, sometimes, calamitous misadventure, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend 
is often called the good Kennedy, the quiet Kennedy, clean Kathleen 
-- and only partly in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two decades, while more famous relatives moved in  
Washington's power corridors and otherwise made headlines, the 
first child of Robert Kennedy built a career in public service; 
raised four daughters, ages 7 to 21, with her college professor 
husband; and, as the eldest of 30 Kennedy cousins, rallied the 
family in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after five years as Maryland's lieutenant governor, Ms.  
Townsend is in position to step forward as the political 
standard-bearer for her generation of Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	The family patriarch, of course, remains U.S. Sen. Edward  
Kennedy. His son, Patrick, a congressman from Rhode Island, has 
proven himself a skilled fund-raiser and heads the House campaign 
committee that helps elects Democrats. Ms. Townsend's younger 
brother, Joseph, left Congress last year after six terms, but 
speculation has him re-entering politics in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, though, is already considered the frontrunner for  
Maryland governor in the 2002 election, and her name has also 
surfaced -- among many others -- as a possible vice presidential 
running mate for Democrat Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other Kennedy of her generation in elected office is  
cousin Mark Shriver, a Maryland state lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, 48, has the characteristic toothy Kennedy smile  
but has had to work hard to pick up the political skills her father 
and uncles exhibited so effortlessly. One family trait she never 
lacked, however, is the competitive Kennedy spirit, especially in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Joseph Tydings, a close friend of Robert Kennedy,  
remembers a touch football game when Kathleen was 10 or 11. She and 
her father went up against Tydings and another man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they beat us or not, but if they didn't, it  
was damned close,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From an early age, Ms. Townsend was expected to shoulder some  
responsibility for her 10 siblings and many cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most cherished possessions -- framed and hanging in a  
hallway of her Victorian home in suburban Baltimore -- is this 
letter Robert Kennedy wrote to his 12-year-old daughter the day 
President John F. Kennedy was buried: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Kathleen. You seem to understand that Jack died and was  
buried today. As the oldest of the Kennedy grandchildren, you have 
a particular responsibility now -- a special responsibility to John 
and Joe. Be kind to others and work for your country. Love, 
Daddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter referred to her brother Joe and to cousin John  
Kennedy Jr., who had turned 3 that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's son was killed July 16 in a private plane crash  
off Martha's Vineyard. The Townsends accompanied President Clinton 
and his family to New York City for the Kennedy memorial service 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kennedy's trust in his daughter was not misplaced.  
Friends say Ms. Townsend can be counted on in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the lead in defending Joe against criticism he'd tried  
to bully his first wife into an annulment of their 12-year 
marriage, two years after they divorced. In 1979, she went to court 
to become brother David's legal guardian, to try to rescue him from 
drug abuse. He had the guardianship revoked a year later and died 
of an overdose in 1984. Another brother, Michael, was killed in a 
skiing accident Dec. 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, David, said in a 1997 interview with The Boston  
Globe Magazine that Ms. Townsend ``plays an enormous leadership 
role in the family. When something happens, like with one of her 
brothers, she is called immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend's first run for office, for Congress in 1986, made  
her the first Kennedy to lose a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	She picked up the pieces and formed the Maryland Student Service  
Alliance in partnership with the state education department, where 
she developed the nation's only statewide program that requires 
public school students to perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, she joined the U.S. Justice Department as a deputy  
assistant attorney general in charge of community policing 
programs, 
</P>
<P>
	Some might have considered her brief political career long dead,  
but in 1994, Parris Glendening surprised all of Maryland by asking 
her to be his lieutenant governor running mate. They won by fewer 
than 6,000 votes but last year won re-election with a margin of 
almost 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend now ``enjoys extremely strong popularity across the  
state,'' says pollster Keith Haller of Potomac Survey research. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of her beliefs diverge from liberal Democratic  
positions associated with Kennedys -- she supports the death 
penalty, for example -- she has defended her positions as very much 
in line with lessons learned from her father. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime friend, Democratic political consultant Bob Shrum,  
said positions may differ, ``but if the question is, does she carry 
on the underlying idealism that motivated her father, I think it's 
clear she does.''

<HEADLINE> New Pressures for Girls in Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In team sports, girls are where the growth is.  
But as competition increases, some coaches report girls' bad 
sportsmanship is increasing, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major growth in youth sports is the result of increased  
female participation,'' said Thomas B. Doyle, vice president of 
information and research for the National Sporting Goods 
Association. Between 1990 and 1998, the participation rates of 
girls rose faster than those of boys in almost every category, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with the new opportunities in girls' athletics comes  
new pressure. Some coaches are reporting that girls, their parents 
and their fans are developing some of the same bad attitudes that 
have been notorious in boys' sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The NSGA, which looked at baseball, basketball, soccer, softball  
and volleyball, divided participants into two classes -- those ages 
7 to 11 and those ages 12 to 17. In almost every category, girls 
outpaced boys, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	In baseball, for instance, participation among girls ages 7-11  
rose 20.5 percent to about 1.07 million who played least twice in a 
given year. In contrast, participation by boys fell 1.9 percent, 
although more boys -- about 4.7 million -- were on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 12- to 17-year-old soccer players, girls' participation  
rose 17.6 percent to about 1.8 million, while boys' participation 
fell 3.2 percent to about 2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The faster rise among girls than boys is likely to continue a  
few years before it begins to slow, Doyle said. And even though 
girls trail in total participation, this only means that girls 
amount to a growth market. ``There is potentially a lot more young 
ladies that could enter team sports than the boys could,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gender equality has much to do with the jump, Doyle said.  
Federal Title IX requirements that schools divide their resources 
fairly are felt most strongly on the college and high school 
levels, he said. But this lets younger players, their parents and 
their coaches dream about athletic stardom. So the enhanced 
opportunities are creating interest in the elementary and 
recreational league levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pre-Title IX, there was almost a discouragement for girls to  
play,'' said Connee Zotos, athletics director at Drew University, 
Madison, N.J. The common attitude toward female athletes was 
``That's nice, dear,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's changed. With more girls and women competing, the  
pressure for a lead position or more playing time becomes more 
intense, Zotos said. And at the highest levels, such as NCAA 
Division I, ``It's a business,'' she said. ``You either produce 
or....'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those pressures filter down, said Zotos, who took part in April  
in a seminar, ``Screaming Parents, Sobbing Athletes,'' organized by 
the Women's Sports Foundation, a gender equality advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Females are not as bad as males are -- at least, not yet, Zotos  
said. ``I'm hoping it never will be to that degree,'' she said. ``I 
hope women draw it back toward the middle.'' But she is hearing bad 
language in the stands and getting more pressure from parents on 
playing time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	What this means is that females respond like males to the same  
athletic pressures, said Holly Gera, athletics director at New 
Jersey's Montclair State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Where the pressure is lower, the conduct often is better, Gera  
said. ``We've had some parents who were overzealous,'' she said. 
But at her school, where the fan base for women's sports is 
relatively small, things are under control, she said.

<HEADLINE> Women's Sports Boom Buoys Benoit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Joan Benoit Samuelson, gold medalist 15  
years ago in the first women's Olympic marathon ever run, insists 
she's now a simple soccer mom interested more in her kids' games 
than her own races. 
</P>
<P>
	But she still laces on running shoes every day and last fall  
qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 42, Samuelson says she's thrilled with the growing  
excitement over women's sports, especially the recent U.S. victory 
in World Cup soccer and the rapid expansion of the Women's National 
Basketball Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were pioneers in sports that opened the door for me, and  
I would like to think in some small way, I helped open the doors 
for the young women ... today,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt of that. Samuelson showed regular people  
what they could accomplish with a lot of hard work, says Marjorie 
Snyder, associate executive director of the Women's Sports 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joan, as an athlete, came along at the right moment and had  
the right attitude about sport,'' Snyder says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was certainly helpful she won'' the marathon, Snyder adds.  
``It's like the women's World Cup. If they'd finished third, I 
don't think there would be quite as much excitement about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelson's victory in the inaugural Olympic marathon, Aug. 5,  
1984, also silenced naysayers who claimed women were physically 
incapable of running 26 miles, 385 yards, says Donna Lopiano, the 
foundation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never slowed, she never faltered. She ran with a  
determination that from beginning to end never wavered,'' Lopiano 
says. ``It closed the book on whether women were made of the right 
stuff in distance running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If her age today might seem an obstacle to a berth in the next  
year's Sydney Olympics, back then it was surgery on her right knee 
-- just 17 days before the trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuelson had felt a twinge in her right knee in March 1984.  
Cortisone shots didn't help, and a month later, she could barely 
hobble through three miles. In late April, she had arthroscopic 
surgery, then a relatively new procedure. She won the trials with a 
time of 2:31:04. Three months later, she collected the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Samuelson -- who still holds the U.S. women's marathon  
record of 2:21:21, set in Chicago in 1985 -- was looking for another 
marathon, hoping to beat 2 hours, 42 minutes to qualify for the 
trials in 2000. She had a short list of cities drawn up but found 
herself in New York City over the Halloween weekend, speaking for 
Nike, the athletic equipment giant that sponsors her in running 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to enter the New York Marathon just that Sunday  
morning. She finished in 12th place -- in 2:41:06. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samuelson insists family, not the the finish line, is now  
her prime interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Running ``is not my entire life. With children and marriage  
priorities, my focus has changed,'' she says by telephone from her 
seaside home in Freeport. ``The most important thing is to have a 
healthy balance with everything you do in your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house she shares with her husband, 11-year-old daughter,  
Abby, and 9-year-old son, Anders, in Freeport is only a half hour 
up the coast from where her impressive running career began. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, she fulfilled her long-held dream of establishing a  
hometown race with the first Beach to Beacon 10K, which attracted 
thousands of world-class athletes and recreational runners. 
</P>
<P>
	The course begins near Crescent Beach State Park in her hometown  
of Cape Elizabeth and offers ocean views en route to the finish 
line at Portland Head Light. It's a route Samuelson traced many 
times while growing up and showcases some of the benchmarks of her 
career, including the high school where she began running, the 
bronze statue outside the library that honors her Olympic triumph 
and her childhood home, not far from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no name more associated with marathoning in America  
than Joan Benoit Samuelson,'' says Dave Mingey, a Nike spokesman. 
``Long before Los Angeles and long after, she was one of the most 
dominant marathoners in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is so beloved at Nike that several buildings at its  
Beaverton, Ore., headquarters are named in her honor, Mingey says. 
The company's Boston Deli recalls her two Boston Marathon wins; the 
convenience store is called Blackberries because she likes to pick 
blackberries when she visits Beaverton. Her pictures dot walls all 
over the campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her work with Nike, Samuelson promotes charitable and  
athletic events and does TV ads for a Portland bank. She speaks 
frequently to schoolchildren and urges them to enjoy sports for 
themselves, not to please others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just tell all the youngsters I address to follow your heart,  
and I tell my children the same thing,'' she says. ``If there isn't 
passion, there isn't fire.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Makes Comeback in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- He stepped off the podium, wrapped both arms around  
his wife and in the safety of her embrace, Lance Armstrong sighed. 
After three grueling weeks racing over mountains, across flatlands 
and away from doubt, he was less concerned with where he was going 
than where he had been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this sends out a fantastic message to all the cancer  
patients and survivors around the world,'' he said. ``We can return 
to what we were before -- and be even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last chapter of the best comeback in sports was written  
Sunday along the Champs-Elysees, the boulevard that cuts a swath 
through the heart of Paris and where, a half-century earlier, 
another contingent of Americans arrived with the cheers of the 
French ringing in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was Armstrong, riding in the protective slipstream  
of his U.S. Postal Service teammates, coming to claim the 
championship of the 2,306-mile, 23-day-long Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	But the story of how he won the world's greatest bicycle race  
was about liberation, too. And about how a strong-willed Texan rode 
his way into the affections of a land that doesn't warm easily to 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, 1996, Armstrong was a very good but not great racer  
with a deadly case of testicular cancer that spread to his lungs 
and brain with alarming speed. Doctors gave him less than a 50 
percent chance of survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I saw him,'' said Dr. Steve Wolff, one of  
Armstrong's oncologists, ``my concern wasn't racing, just keeping 
him alive. But he's such a fierce human being. The extraordinary 
thing, even back then, was how certain Lance was about one day 
coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That day arrived with Wolff sitting in the grandstand behind the  
winner's podium, alongside other board members of a foundation 
Armstrong created to benefit cancer patients. A row ahead of Wolff 
sat Armstrong's wife, Kristin. Next to her was his mother, Linda, 
occasionally waving a tiny American flag to ward off the shakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag went up each time her only child rushed past in a  
technicolor blur, distinguishable because he wore the leader's 
distinctive yellow jersey -- le maillot jaune. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did everything so fast,'' Linda Armstrong said, then  
paused. A moment later, the accomplishments came spilling out. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance was winning 10-kilometer runs against grownups before he  
finished sixth grade. Soon after, he represented his hometown, 
Austin, Texas, in statewide swim meets. By age 15, he added bike 
racing to his repertoire and became a top-flight triathlete. Two 
years later, he watched fellow American Greg LeMond win the Tour de 
France a second time and decided it was something he, too, could 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, as a 21-year-old, Armstrong made the U.S. Olympic team.  
The next year, edging closer to his goal, he won a road-racing 
world championship. When he made the Olympic squad again in 1996, 
everything seemed in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then,'' Linda Armstrong remembered ruefully, ``along came  
that minor setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's almost possible to think of his bout with cancer that way  
now. Especially hearing Armstrong's doctors marvel over how he 
resumed training between doses of chemotherapy. They counseled 
patience, but Armstrong had a schedule in his head. Gradually, 
almost grudgingly, everyone else began working off that calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	By last year, thanks to an almost insatiable appetite for hard  
work, Armstrong was back at his old discipline -- road-racing -- and 
competitive again. But the Tour de France demands much more than a 
single skill. 
</P>
<P>
	First run in 1903, the race now features 20 stages that take  
some 200 riders around France. A stage can be as short as four 
miles, such as the opening prologue race that gave Armstrong his 
first win, or as long as 148 miles. They can be over flat roads, or 
up and down mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Never known as a strong climber before, Armstrong took control  
of the race for good with back-to-back wins in stages 9 and 10. It 
was the second of those wins, on a difficult climb up the Alps, 
that brought the scrutiny of French newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Tour struggling to recover from a doping scandal last  
year, and the French shut out of even a single stage win for the 
first time since 1926, the potshots began. In headlines loaded with 
double-entendres, they implied Armstrong was using 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to a head Wednesday, during the second of two  
days of racing through the Pyrenees. That's when Armstrong angrily 
appeared at a news conference to explain that trace amounts of 
cortisone found in his system were from a prescription skin cream 
he used to treat saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the lowpoint,'' Armstrong recalled. ``A lot of things  
were happening. The going was tough, we were all fatigued and 
everybody was saying things. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you crack in the mountains,'' he said, ``you lose the  
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong didn't crack. He roared back three days later to win  
his fourth stage overall and lock up the race. And that set the 
stage for his triumphant procession into Paris, where, like his 
countryman LeMond a few years earlier, he was welcomed almost as a 
native son. 
</P>
<P>
	French flags fluttered in a gentle breeze and sunlight washed  
over the wide boulevard as Armstrong soaked in the cheers of a 
crowd that called his name over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more than I ever thought it would be,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage on Rams First Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- St. Louis Rams players had to dress in the  
dark because of a power outage for their first full-pad workout in 
104-degree weather Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The electricity went out at Western Illinois' Brophy Hall about  
2 p.m. -- about 1 1-2 hours before practice -- and it wasn't restored 
for more than three hours. Equipment manager Todd Hewitt borrowed 
two flashlights from campus police and a scented strawberry candle 
from the locker of defensive lineman Jeff Zgonina so he could issue 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Players at first were hoping that practice might be cancelled.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first thing that crossed my mind,'' rookie safety  
Rich Coady said. ``I think that's the first thing that crosses 
anybody's mind when anything's not exactly like it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After those hopes were dashed, they got down to business. The  
only problem anyone had was linebacker Charlie Clemons forgot to 
put on his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Coady, a third-round pick out of Texas A&AMP;M, said he didn't  
really want to skip practice. Coach Dick Vermeil had already given 
players the morning off except for a special teams walkthrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always looking at it as `Hey, we're going to have practice  
unless Coach Vermeil is having a great day or something and lets us 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil wasn't about to do that. Temperatures have been above or  
near triple digits the first three days of camp, but so far he has 
made few concessions. On Saturday he switched a full-pad workout to 
shoulder pads and shorts, and on Sunday he cut the scheduled 2 
1-2-hour workout about 25 minutes short. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to run away from heat up here,'' Vermeil said.  
``You can't set the tone that every time it's hot we're going to do 
something to make it more comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil also pointed out that the Rams, who play home games in  
the air-conditioned Trans World Dome, might face heat in the third 
game of the season at Cincinnati Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be muggier than hell,'' he said. ``We can't ask them  
to take the pads off.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Defends Its Record on Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- CBS has been more diligent than other  
networks in working to include minorities in its schedule, CBS 
executive Leslie Moonves said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast networks have come under fire from the NAACP  
and others for fielding a nearly all-white lineup of new fall 
shows. CBS is not exempt from the criticism, with its new offerings 
largely devoid of color. 
</P>
<P>
	But Moonves, president and chief executive officer of CBS  
Television, said the network does feature ethnic characters in 12 
of its 19 fall series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can, we will do more ... but CBS stands alone as the No. 1  
network aware of its responsibility in this area,'' Moonves told 
the summer meeting of the Television Critics Association. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is the home of Cosby, Cheech Marin (``Nash Bridges''), Della  
Reese (``Touched by an Angel'') and others, Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network will meet with the NAACP within the next month to  
discuss the issue, Moonves said. 
</P>
<P>
	But CBS boasted Sunday about two new shows -- the fall series  
``Now and Again,'' which features black actor Dennis Haysbert as a 
scientist, and ``City of Angels,'' a midseason hospital drama with 
a predominantly black cast. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter, from veteran producer Steven Bochco (``Hill Street  
Blues,'' ``L.A. Law,'' ``NYPD Blue''), stars Vivica A. Fox, Blair 
Underwood and Michael Warren. 
</P>
<P>
	A major reason for doing the series was to use the many black  
actors, writers and directors who are ignored by the industry, 
Bochco said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this extraordinary talent pool underutilized in our  
business, both in New York and Los Angeles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren, who played police Officer Bobby Hill in ``Hill Street  
Blues,'' lamented television's lack of progress since a 
two-decade-old study on the lack of racial inclusiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're asking the same question that was asked 22 years  
ago, something needs to be done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochco called the lack of minorities on TV a function of  
economics rather than racism. 
</P>
<P>
	If audiences fail to watch shows such as ``Paris,'' a drama  
Bochco produced a decade ago starring James Earl Jones, or the 
failed 1995 family drama ``Under One Roof,'' networks don't want to 
take the risk again, he said.

<HEADLINE> Seth Green Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't blame movies, TV and video games for  
school violence, Seth Green says. 
</P>
<P>
	``When tragedies like Columbine happen, everybody wants a face,  
and entity to blame it on -- and movies, TV, music, and video games 
are easy targets,'' Green, who plays the werewolf Oz on ``Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer'' and Scott Evil in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who 
Shagged Me,'' said in the July 26 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, if you want a target, let's look at the gun lobbies that  
have so much power in Washington that they keep the Congress, the 
president and the people from really addressing the situation,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings at Columbine High School prompted the WB network  
to postpone airing the season-ending episode of ``Buffy'' because 
it depicted high school students taking up arms.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Arrested in Park Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos upcoming    	
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A hotel maintenance man was arrested  
in the beheading of a naturalist at Yosemite National Park and is a 
suspect in the killings of three park sightseers earlier this year, 
the FBI said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner was accused of killing Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26,  
whose decapitated body was found near her Yosemite housing on 
Thursday. The 37-year-old man was arrested Saturday at a nudist 
colony and is scheduled be arraigned Monday on a charge of murder 
in a national park, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who was questioned at the time of the three previous  
slayings but ruled out as a suspect, is now believed to have played 
a role in those crimes, said Special Agent in Charge James M. 
Maddock. The bodies of Carole Sund, her daughter Juli, and family 
friend Silvina Pelosso of Argentina were discovered in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have developed specific information linking Stayner to the  
Sund-Pelosso murders,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is indelibly etched in the annals of  
California crime. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Steven Stayner, was a sexually abused kidnap victim  
who was abducted off a Merced street in 1972. The boy was reunited 
with his family seven years later. But as if he lived his short 
life under a cloud, Steven Stayner died in 1989 in a collision with 
a hit-and-run driver at 24. 
</P>
<P>
	A television miniseries later portrayed the saga of his  
abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner was last seen Thursday night by friends and  
coworkers at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, where he works as a 
handyman. He was taken into custody by federal authorities Saturday 
morning at a nudist colony in Wilton, near Sacramento, after a 
person recognized him from news reports and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Armstrong's body was discovered a few hundred yards from the  
park housing she shared with a man and woman, who were away at the 
time. A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told 
The Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	She was last seen alive Wednesday at the park offices of  
Yosemite Institute, where she worked. The institute's main offices 
are in El Portal -- on the outskirts of Yosemite -- and the 
organization has held conferences at the Cedar Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	El Portal is also the town where the victims in the previous  
slayings were last seen alive in February during a sightseeing 
trip. The three women stayed at the Cedar Lodge, where Stayner has 
rented a room above the restaurant for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired there in August 1997 and was laid off in January of  
this year because of a slowdown in business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rehired March 20, a day after Mrs. Sund's and Silvina's  
bodies were found in the trunk of their rental car. Juli's body was 
later found hidden off a lightly traveled highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Carole Sund, Carole and Francis Carrington, were  
at the FBI's press conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy that it looks like maybe the case is over,''  
Carole Carrington said after the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings some closure, no question,'' her husband said.  
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents had previously said they had zeroed in on a  
loose-knit group of methamphetamine users in connection with the 
sightseers case and were confident that some of those responsible 
are already behind bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the new development, Maddock said they would be  
reevaluating the possible roles of others who have come under 
scrutiny in the sightseers case. There is no evidence linking 
Stayner to those people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at whether (Stayner) is solely responsible (for  
the sightseers murders) or if others are involved,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock also said he has asked himself if the FBI could have  
done anything to prevent Armstrong's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I struggled with that issue for the last 24 hours and I  
continue to do so,'' he said. ``I'm confident we've done everything 
that reasonably could have been done.''

<HEADLINE> Turner Has 'Something To Prove' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- After the turmoil and excitement of the  
past two weeks, the three-hour drive to the Allegheny Mountains 
wasn't about to provide any kind of escape for the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a normal urgency, and then obviously there's a lot  
more,'' coach Norv Turner said Sunday as the first players reported 
to training camp. ``I think everyone who's with the Redskin 
organization has something to prove. I certainly feel like I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, who needs to make the playoffs this season to have a  
chance at keeping his job, is trying to get the focus on Xs and Os 
and practice schedules. That's not easy to do when new owner Daniel 
Snyder is shaking up the management and business side of things, 
firing more than two dozen employees and ousting Charley Casserly 
from the general manager's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one's been asking a lot about it,'' Turner said. ``But  
yeah, it's nice to get started on the football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans making the annual pilgrimage to Frostburg are just as  
anxious about the man who spent $800 million for their favorite 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of nervous,'' said Pete Burke, from Syracuse, N.Y.,  
as he stood outside the players' dorm collecting autographs on a 
shirt. ``What's he going to do with everybody? He's got rid of all 
the people in the front office already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 47 players -- rookies, quarterbacks and players coming off  
injuries -- are eligible to practice starting Monday. The rest of 
the roster takes the field Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	If it's any consolation to Turner, the players are the most  
oblivious to the saga. All they've heard is that Snyder wants them 
to shape up and win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really keep up with it at all,'' fullback Larry Bowie  
said. ``I don't think it really affects me. The new owner has his 
opinion as to how he thinks the team should be. I think it'll have 
some effect as far as making some of the guys perform better or 
come out with a different attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Distractions aside, there are plenty of practical football  
matters on Turner's plate. 
</P>
<P>
	His No. 1 priority over the next three days is getting new  
quarterback Brad Johnson in the flow. The Redskins gave up three 
draft picks for Johnson in February, but he missed most of the 
spring workouts because of knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also the battle for the job of starting left tackle.  
Shar Pourdanesh and Joe Paten will get plenty of scrutiny right 
away, and the winner will get to challenge free-agent signee Andy 
Heck when he arrives Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner also has a rare Redskins luxury: His first-round draft  
choice isn't a holdout. If Champ Bailey can get a quick feel for 
the cornerback spot, Turner said he could foresee the No. 7 overall 
pick getting some snaps at receiver on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the newest face in Redskins management, Vinny  
Cerrato, will spend the next month or so shopping for more players. 
The Redskins have three first-round draft picks next year, giving 
Cerrato plenty of room to deal if he sees an obvious gap that needs 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will look into anything that will help upgrade the  
roster,'' said Cerrato, hired on Friday as Casserle's replacement 
and given the title of director of player personnel. ``Those draft 
picks are very valuable, so it would have be something very 
enticing.''

<HEADLINE> Brett, Ryan Lead Hall of Fame Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- The great clutch hitter choked up.  
</P>
<P>
	George Brett, who built a Hall of Fame career excelling under  
pressure, broke down on the podium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty stressful,'' he said after the induction  
ceremonies. ``I felt like I was up there for an eternity. I can't 
keep my emotions in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett followed Nolan Ryan to the stage, and it wasn't long  
before his voice started cracking and tears began forming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today concludes a long journey,'' he said. ``I stand humbly  
before you in Cooperstown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A record crowd estimated at 50,000 jammed an open field a few  
miles from the shrine, watching the largest Hall class since Sandy 
Koufax led a parade of eight in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Yount, Orlando Cepeda and Ryan spoke, and Brett went last.  
Late umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leagues pitcher Smokey Joe 
Williams and turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee also were 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan spent most of his 16-minute speech thanking those who had  
made his career possible. Along with family members and friends, 
the man whose Hall plaque praised him as a ``Texas legend'' paid 
tribute to former players' union chief Marvin Miller and all fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought there was going to be life after baseball,''  
the greatest power pitcher ever said, evenly. ``I didn't realize 
the grip baseball had on me. It took me two full years to get over 
the fact that I was no longer a baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, 52, played a record 27 seasons and holds major league  
marks of seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. He finished 
324-292, yet never won a Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``A fierce competitor and one of baseball's most intimidating  
figures on the pitching mound,'' read his bronze plaque, which 
bears a ``T'' for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and Yount each topped 3,000 hits and Cepeda hit 379 home  
runs. All three were Ryan strikeout victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four Hall inductees -- 15 of them struck out by the Ryan  
Express -- turned out for the 60th anniversary festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, the oldest at 80, stayed more than a hour in the  
sweltering heat before leaving in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the hero of the recent All-Star Game at Fenway Park,  
and Willie Mays, who made a rare return to see former teammate 
Cepeda, got some of the biggest ovations. 
</P>
<P>
	Also receiving a huge cheer was Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the  
former owner of the Texas Rangers. New York Gov. George Pataki, 
mentioned as a possible running mate on a presidential ticket with 
Bush, implored, ``Let's have another great New York welcome for 
Governor Bush!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only boos of the afternoon came for commissioner Bud Selig.  
He was met with calls of ``Where's Pete Rose?'' and ``How about 
Charlie Hustle?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, as has become his custom, was on Main Street, signing  
autographs just blocks from the Hall. Banned from baseball, he's 
ineligible for Hall election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've expressed my opinion to Mr. Selig. My thoughts are Pete  
Rose should be in the Hall of Fame,'' Ryan said later. ``Pete Rose 
should be judged on his merits as a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's inductees increased the Hall membership to 244 --  
with space for only 240 plaques in the main gallery, extra room was 
found in an adjacent rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, first-time candidates include Jack Morris, Goose  
Gossage and Kent Hrbek. Tony Perez and Carlton Fisk will again 
appear on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett had 3,154 hits and batted .305 in a 21-year career with  
Kansas City. ``Played each game with ceaseless intensity and 
unbridled passion,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, 46, brought his family, including son Robin -- named for  
Yount -- and two of his three brothers. Ken was a former big league 
pitcher and Bobby was a minor leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearful during his 17-minute speech, Brett looked at his older  
brothers and said, ``Sometimes I wonder why all this happened to me 
and not you. All I ever wanted to do was be as good as you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, a two-time AL MVP, had 3,142 hits in a 20-year career  
with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bastion of consistency and durability,'' read his plaque,  
which also denoted his ``stoic demeanor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, 43, was afraid his emotions might get the best of him. So  
he called Hall officials about three weeks ago and asked to speak 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed of being in the Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``And  
with all due respect, Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the 
luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, was the second player from Puerto Rico to be  
elected, following Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``His ability to drive the ball with authority was respected and  
feared,'' his plaque read. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda rose to stardom with the San Francisco Giants, and  
entered the Hall wearing their cap. His final season was 1974, when 
he played two months with Brett for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kid is never going to make it,'' Cepeda recalled himself  
thinking, drawing a laugh from Brett. ``Sometimes, you make 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, who worked in the AL from 1954-78, was only the eighth  
umpire elected. Accepting on his behalf was his son, Bob -- Chylak 
was working when Bob was born, learning of the birth on the Yankee 
Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams played in the Negro leagues from 1910-32. In a 1952  
poll by the Pittsburgh Courier, he beat out Satchel Paige as black 
baseball's best pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Selee managed the Boston Beaneaters and Chicago Cubs from  
1890-1905. He is credited with turning catcher Frank Chance into a 
first baseman, creating the Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance infield. 
</P>
<P>
	Also honored were Bob Stevens of the San Francisco Chronicle and  
late announcer Arch McDonald. Stevens won the J.G. Taylor Spink 
Award for writing and McDonald got the Ford C. Frick Award for 
broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Wins Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong rode to victory in the Tour de  
France on Sunday, capping an amazing comeback from cancer and 
becoming just the second American to win cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	Near death two years ago, Armstrong sprinted to the finish line  
on the Champs-Elysees to claim the inspirational victory that had 
seemed certain for days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotion is incredible,'' the smiling Texan said. ``I never  
expected to be here. I never expected to win. It's a wonderful 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finish under brilliant skies couldn't have been more  
different from last year's. The 1998 race ended in rain after a 
disastrous drug scandal nearly ended the event and placed the 
entire sport under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Armstrong was dogged in the last three weeks by  
accusations in the French media that he used performance-enhancing 
drugs. Many people couldn't believe that a cyclist recovering from 
testicular cancer could prevail in one of the most grueling 
competitions in all of sports. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no proof, however. The sport's ruling body, which  
tests the cyclists during the race, said the only drug Armstrong 
used was an approved prescription cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory was simply a remarkable example of grit and  
determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor,'' Armstrong said of his victory ride into  
Paris. ``For American cycling, and for the cancer community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the Tour de France was Greg  
LeMond, a three-time champion whose last victory came in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's mother, Linda, was shaking and waving a small U.S.  
flag as she watched her son wave from the winner's podium. She 
called his cancer a ``minor setback,'' and said ``it was never in 
our minds'' that he wouldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong went into the audience to hug and kiss his wife,  
Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked so hard to get this,'' she said. ``He deserves it,  
every last bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had a commanding 7-minute, 37-second lead over his top  
rival, Alex Zulle of Switzerland, going into the 20th and final 
stage, and only a disastrous fall could have denied him victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was won by Australia's Robbie McEwen. He edged  
Germany's Erik Zabel in a furious sprint. Armstrong finished 86th -- 
in the 86th Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Armstrong won the race's final time trial just as  
convincingly as he'd won the other two in the race, further 
cementing his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996, and  
the disease spread to his brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	After four rounds of chemotherapy and two operations -- one to  
remove a testicle and one for brain lesions -- he began his comeback 
early last year. His doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer 
will return. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to Armstrong's Tour de France victory was his  
ability to master the challenging mountain climbs that had always 
given him trouble. After he easily won the first stage in the Alps, 
he became the prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zulle finished second in the overall standings, and Spain's  
Fernando Escartin came in third at 10 minutes, 26 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's stage was a fairly easy 89-mile ride from Arpajon up to  
Paris, and then past many of the city's grandest sights: the 
Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens with their giant summer ferris wheel, 
the arcaded Rue de Rivoli, the Place de la Concorde with its 
Egyptian obelisk, and then up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de 
Triomphe for a loop that was repeated 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the stage, it was a time for humor and  
camaraderie in the pack. French national champion Francois Simon 
had dyed his hair the red-white-and-blue of his jersey. And not 
only was Armstrong clad in the yellow shirt of the leader, his 
wheel was, too, spokes and all. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Armstrong was to lose that newly decorated wheel to a  
puncture, but his loyal teammates on the U.S. Postal Service team 
helped him back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked as he rode off whether he ever imagined he'd achieve this  
victory after being so ill, he replied: ``No, never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was disappointing for the home country. French cyclists  
did not win a stage for the first time since 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a huge boost for American cycling. Even when LeMond  
won the race, it was not with an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old U.S. Postal Service team had been euphoric  
throughout the race. Early on, team managing director Mark Gorski 
called an overall victory akin to a team of French players winning 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong was most concerned about what the victory would  
mean for cancer survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it sends out a fantastic message to all survivors  
around the world,'' he said. ``We can return to what we were before 
-- and even better.''

<HEADLINE> Media Firm Buys Into NBA Mavericks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The company that owns the Dallas Morning News  
announced plans to buy a minority interest in the Dallas Mavericks 
for $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belo Corp., which also own TV station WFAA, will own 12.38  
percent of the NBA team. A group headed by Ross Perot Jr. owns a 
majority stake in the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Belo obtained a 6.19 percent nonvoting  
interest in The Arena Group, the partnership formed by the 
Mavericks and the National Hockey League Dallas Stars to build and 
operate the new arena under construction in downtown Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is subject to NBA approval, which is expected to take  
about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are excited about the opportunity to have a relationship  
with the Dallas Mavericks and the NBA,'' said Robert W. Decherd, 
Belo's chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major league sports are an important part of the fabric of  
this community. Belo's investment in the Mavericks enhances our 
participation in the immense popularity of professional sports in 
the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the company's largest market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Gaar, Belo's vice president for financial and investor  
relations, said the company will not take an active role in the 
management of the team or the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12.38 percent stake was the interest retained by original  
Mavericks owner Donald Carter when he sold the team to Perot's 
group in 1996. Crescent Real Estate Co., owned by Fort Worth 
financier Richard Rainwater, bought the stake in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo, based in Dallas, also owns seven other daily newspapers  
and 16 other network TV stations.

<HEADLINE> Photos Upset 'Dawson's Creek' Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michelle Williams has appeared on stage totally  
naked and has been on her own since age 15. On top of that, she 
plays a bad girl on ``Dawson's Creek.'' Still, when the teen-age 
actress saw a sexy photo of her on a magazine cover, she was 
horrified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those pictures are not me,'' Williams says in Sunday's Daily  
News, referring to the cover shot and other photos in Maxim 
magazine. ``You should see me in flannel pajamas and greasy hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It upsets me to see those pictures. I hate the fact that the  
girls who watch `Dawson's Creek' will see them. I have a 
15-year-old sister. I don't want to be an unhealthy role model. I 
don't want to see girls like me trivialized and sexualized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 18, moved to Los Angeles from San Diego -- alone -- to  
pursue her acting career, having graduated from high school at age 
15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the `from-birth-to-16-year-old' blues. It was a  
perpetual mood in my life,'' she said. ``So I moved out. I don't 
know if I was ready, but I was determined.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Focuses on Foul Ferries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Durand of Bainbridge Island, Wash., loves  
his daily commute across Puget Sound, where ferry boats cut the 
crisp sea air and offer stunning views of Mount Rainier and 
Seattle's skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be absolutely gorgeous,'' says Durand, a 36-year-old  
manager at a computer software company. ``It's actually a nice way 
to get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a study released this month discloses a darker side of the  
boats that carry millions of passengers in California, Washington, 
Alaska and 32 other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluewater Network, a San Francisco-based environmental group,  
says ferries are 10 times more polluting per passenger than 
automobiles and nearly 13 times more polluting than buses. 
</P>
<P>
	While questioned by some, the study has raised eyebrows among  
environmentalists and ferry buffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency also has turned its  
regulatory eye on ferries and other commercial boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the EPA is supposed to complete a  
rule in November that for the first time will regulate emissions 
from diesel-powered marine engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, to take effect in 2006, would allow 7.2 grams per  
kilowatt hour of exhaust emissions that contribute to ozone -- down 
nearly 50 percent from the 13.3 grams per hour the engines now 
emit. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ferry riders are aware of the black smoke that comes from  
ferry smokestacks but assume the vessels are good for the 
environment on the whole because they carry hundreds of people who 
otherwise might drive cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The study highlights a trend among environmental groups  
increasingly focusing public attention on the down side of 
unconventional modes of transportation such as personal 
water-craft, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferries ``may have gotten a free pass'' as environmental groups  
looked at pollution resulting from cars and sport utility vehicles, 
said Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ferry engines may deserve scrutiny,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bluewater Network used emission and ridership data for cars,  
buses and a popular ferry route in San Francisco to conclude that 
diesel buses emit pollutants of 0.63 grams per passenger mile, cars 
emit 0.80 grams per passenger mile, and diesel ferries emit 7.90 
grams per passenger mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Long, the group's executive director, said that while he  
expected ferries to pollute more than buses or cars, he was shocked 
by the extent of the difference -- and a little saddened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame we have to deromanticize the ferry as a result of  
this,'' he said. ``They're an elegant way to travel to and from 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferries carry 100 million passengers each year in 35 states,  
according to the International Marine Transit Association, a ferry 
group in Hingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges and cars put many ferries out of business earlier this  
century, but the boats have been getting more popular in recent 
years due to gridlock, new waterfront developments and ``fast 
ferries'' that can travel more than 30 mph, said Martha Reardon, 
secretary-treasurer of the ferry group. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very much of a revival,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell Hancock, vice president of the Bay Area Council, a  
business group that wants to add 120 fast ferries in San Francisco, 
said marine engines are dirty because it takes far more horsepower 
to move a ferry through choppy waters than it does to push a bus on 
wheels along a smooth road. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hancock contends Bluewater overstated the size of some  
ferries in the San Francisco plan and understated the amount of 
time cars will spend gridlocked in coming years. Increasing traffic 
means cumulative car emissions will escalate, he said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Skeptical About Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley calls it a threat to the poor.  
Pat Buchanan warns it can ruin families. Steve Forbes voted against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls find that most Americans favor legalized gambling. But  
most presidential candidates are skeptical, if not downright 
hostile, toward the proliferation of casinos, lotteries and other 
forms of state-sponsored or state-sanctioned betting. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans Forbes, Buchanan, Lamar Alexander and Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, and Democrat Bradley, are among the candidates on 
the record criticizing gambling as a bad bet for American families, 
particularly young people and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona may be the candidate  
friendliest to the gambling industry. He is a longtime defender of 
Indian tribal casinos and supported legislation in 1995 paving the 
way for gambling ``cruises to nowhere.'' Las Vegas casino 
executives Steve Wynn and J. Terrance Lanni have each given the 
maximum $1,000 to McCain's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore has parked himself on middle ground  
between McCain and the gambling critics. Gore ``believes it is up 
to individual communities to make the decision about whether 
gambling should be legalized,'' his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because lotteries and casinos are run or regulated on the state  
level, gambling may never emerge as a major issue in federal 
campaigns. Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia now run 
lotteries, while commercial casinos operate in 10 states and Indian 
tribes run casinos in at least 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gallup poll released last month found that nearly two-thirds  
of American adults approve of legal gambling, but that 55 percent 
of them believe it is creating ``a compulsive gambling problem in 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, for one, seems to share that ambivalence.  
</P>
<P>
	He presides over a state lottery approved by Texas voters three  
years before he became governor. Bush himself, as a private 
citizen, voted in favor of creating the lottery, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Bush has made clear that he has qualms about gambling and  
would campaign and vote against the introduction of casinos if 
voters are presented with another ballot question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Casino gambling is not OK. It has ruined the lives of too many  
adults and it can do the same thing to our children,'' Bush 
declared in the report of his state Task Force on Illegal Gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a New Jersey resident, says he voted against introducing  
casino gambling in Atlantic City in 1977. In a 1996 column panning 
proposals to allow video gambling on airplanes, the magazine 
publisher wrote: ``We have enough gambling opportunities on the 
ground. There ought to be a haven in the heavens from these 
temptations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, as governor of Tennessee for eight years, opposed  
gambling except for bingo for charitable purposes. In 1980, he 
opposed legalizing pinball gambling as ``a consumer rip-off that 
preyed on the young and would have attracted organized crime to our 
state,'' according to campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other Republican presidential hopefuls:  
</P>
<P>
	--Gary Bauer has called gambling ``an addictive blight'' and  
challenged other Republicans to turn down campaign contributions 
from gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
	--At a 1995 rally in Iowa, Buchanan called legalized gambling ``a  
vice and an addiction ... destructive to the work ethic (and) 
ruinous to the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch startled the gambling industry in 1997 by  
briefly proposing to close and ban any gambling establishment 
within 10,000 feet of where young people congregate, including 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former Vice President Dan Quayle ``has very serious concerns  
about the impact gambling has on the American family'' but 
ultimately believes the decision is up to individual states, his 
campaign says. 
</P>
<P>
	--Former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole said through  
a spokesman that gambling ``helps communities by creating tax 
revenues (but) also has human consequences that can lead to broken 
families and crime.'' The issue is one for states to sort out, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Gore's hands-off approach to gambling  
contrasts with the views of his only challenger. As a senator from 
New Jersey, Bradley sponsored a 1987 law banning sports betting in 
the 46 states that did not then allow it. He told reporters in New 
Hampshire this year that if he were a governor, he would reject 
more gambling because it attracts and hurts low-income people.

<HEADLINE> New Software Lets You 'Beam' Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODSIDE, Calif. -- Sipping coffee at Buck's Restaurant early  
Friday, a venture capitalist beamed a $3 million investment through 
his Palm organizer to the happy, startup CEO sitting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrons munching their poached eggs and hash browns couldn't  
actually see the flurry of money flying through the air, but that's 
virtually what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Within seconds, the words: ``Would you like to accept the  
money?'' popped up on Confinity CEO Peter A. Thiel's Palm 
organizer. He quickly tapped ``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course that's an understatement,'' said Thiel. ``It should  
say, 'Yes, yes!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus came the official launch of PayPal, an instant payment  
service that allows people to exchange money through their Palm 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works: registered users type the amount they want  
to pay another person into their device. They tap a ``Pay'' button, 
and then point their device at the recipients' Palm organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	The information is sent via infrared beam, the same way a remote  
control sends messages to a television. The recipient later 
synchronizes his device at a personal computer, directing PayPal to 
either deposit the money directly into their bank account, send 
them a check, or just keep it in an account so they can pay someone 
else next time. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiel, who successfully pocketed his $3 million through his  
PayPal on Friday, said he expects most users to be between 20 and 
35 years old, transferring much smaller amounts. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Injury Threatens Dellucci's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- David Dellucci, the promising young outfielder  
for the Arizona Diamondbacks, will undergo surgery on his left 
wrist this week to repair a rare, serious condition that threatens 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the operation to shorten the radius bone in his  
forearm, tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, there is no certainty 
that Dellucci will be able to play professional baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very serious condition. This is not a minor  
problem,'' said Dr. Don Sheridan, an orthopedic wrist and hand 
surgeon who will perform the operation. ``It's also one that is not 
easily fixable or 100 percent fixable. I think David has got about 
a 70 percent chance of having a good result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His condition is a form of vascular necrosis similar to the hip  
disorder that ended Bo Jackson's football career and a condition 
that may be the cause of NFL running back Garrison Hearst's ankle 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wrist, the condition is known as Kienbock's disease. If  
not corrected, it would result in the bone in Dellucci's left hand 
slowly dying and ``turning to rubble,'' Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The condition, which Sheridan classified as an injury, was  
caused by the length of Dellucci's left radius bone combined with 
the repeated jarring that comes with playing baseball, especially 
at the high-octane intensity level that is Dellucci's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci, who was batting .394 in limited duty, had worked his  
way into the starting lineup in recent weeks. He was 16-for-32 in 
his last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci said Sunday that he did not announce he would have the  
surgery until he had a chance to talk to his family late Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scared that there's a chance this may fail, but I can't  
look at it that way,'' he said. ``I've been overcoming odds all my 
life to get here. This is just another bump in the road to get 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci said the wrist has been bothering him for a long time  
but the pain had become unbearable the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I keep playing with it the way it is, my bone would pretty  
much disintegrate in my hand,'' he said. ``The best thing to do is 
get surgery, and the sooner the better. I've never had a broken 
bone. I've never had any trouble whatsoever. This is just a case 
where one bone is longer than the other, and every time I take a 
shot to this hand, nothing is there to brace it. It's a serious 
operation, and it's something I have to do to keep playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The repeated jarring of the radius bone has damaged one of the  
many small, dice-sized wrist bones known as the lunate, Sheridan 
said. That, in turn, has cut off much of the blood supply to the 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``If David continues to play he is at high risk and is almost  
certain to sustain irreversible damage such that it would be 
career-ending,'' Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dellucci's penchant for constant hustle, diving for balls in the  
outfield and sliding head-first on the base paths ``probably 
contributed'' to the problem, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan planned to shorten the radius bone by 3 or 4  
millimeters to more evenly distribute the force across Dellucci's 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	If the surgery is successful and the recovery goes well,  
Dellucci would be ready for spring training next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if anybody has the ability to come back from an injury  
like this, it would be somebody like David,'' Sheridan said. ``He's 
young, is in extremely good physical condition and he's 
demonstrated that he has the desire and motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But would he be able to play with his previous fervor?  
</P>
<P>
	``Depending on how it turns out, hopefully it will be a good  
wrist for him that won't interfere with his ability to play,'' 
Sheridan said. ``But I probably will hold my breath every time I 
see him dive for a ball.''

<HEADLINE> McNabb Absent as Eagles Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Donovan McNabb, the No. 2 draft pick  
expected to lead the Philadelphia Eagles out of one of the team's 
darkest eras, was absent and unsigned Sunday as rookies reported 
for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb did not join first-year players and selected veterans at  
a team meeting Sunday night. First-year coach Andy Reid said McNabb 
and other unsigned players would be fined if they missed any 
practice time. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time the Eagles had unsigned rookies at the  
start of camp since Jeffrey Lurie bought the team in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not allow the signings to be a distraction,'' said  
Reid, hired to replace Ray Rhodes after Philadelphia went 3-13 last 
season. ``We will go forth with those players that are on hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also signed second-round pick Barry Gardner to a  
five-year deal, fourth-round pick John Wellbourne to a three-year 
deal, and sixth-round pick Cecil Martin to a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Four draft picks remained unsigned when Reid convened his first  
official meeting as coach Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid expected about 30 players on the field Monday morning for  
practice, but didn't know when McNabb or the other unsigned rookies 
would report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter whether it's Donovan or whomever,'' Reid  
said. ``Any time a player misses a practice, it's a problem. I've 
talked to you about the quarterback position before. That's an 
important position. It doesn't help his progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb is listed as the backup quarterback to Doug Pederson, a  
31-year-old career third-stringer whom Reid has picked as the 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith, and Eagles executive vice  
president Joe Banner have said that voidable years and a buyback 
clause are the sticking points in negotiations. The Eagles don't 
want voidable years, while Smith is looking to include them after 
three or four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is believed to be considering a seven-year offer worth  
about $50 million, including a signing bonus of up to $12 million. 
Reid talked with Banner Sunday and characterized negotiations as 
``productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides want this to work,'' Reid said. ``They're going to  
exhaust the ends here to make this happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Banner characterized the contract as about 60 percent finished.  
Still, he acknowledged that McNabb would miss practice time even if 
he signed late Sunday night. McNabb's contract will be 20-30 pages 
long when it's finished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic, but I don't want to give the impression that I  
think it's imminent,'' Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's absence placed added pressure on Pederson, a free agent  
from Green Bay who showed up on time at the team's training 
facility at Lehigh University. Veterans report to camp on 
Wednesday, and the team holds its first full-squad workout with 
Reid as coach on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookies hold their first workout Monday morning with or without  
McNabb, the former Syracuse quarterback picked after the Cleveland 
Browns chose Tim Couch.

<HEADLINE> Why Are Prairie Chickens Dying? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLCOMB, Kan. (AP) -- They are known affectionately as the  
``Chicken Boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their mission is to find out why the population of lesser  
prairie chickens is declining on the grasslands of southwest 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although their nickname and the subject of their study might  
sound humorous, diminishing numbers of the bird may be a warning 
that its habitat is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the canary in the mine. If we lose the prairie chicken,  
it's an indication that the prairie isn't healthy,'' said Brent 
Jamison, one of three researchers conducting a study sponsored by 
Kansas State University and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there are no exact figures on the number of lesser  
prairie chickens in Kansas, surveys show the population has 
declined since the 1960s throughout its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesser prairie chicken, which actually is a small grouse  
with brown and white stripes, lives in Colorado, Kansas, New 
Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. Kansas and Texas still have hunting 
seasons for the bird, but the other three states have closed their 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three years, researchers have been studying the  
bird's habitat on 14,400 acres of the Sunflower Electric Power 
Corp.'s plant site in Holcomb. The site includes the sand sagebrush 
prairie that the lesser prairie chicken favors for nesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have trapped 293 birds and have placed radio collars  
on about 160. They now are tracking the movements of 60 birds that 
have been collared this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers point to the conversion of the prairie to  
cropland as the biggest reason for the demise of the lesser prairie 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	This process has occurred largely during the past 50 years,  
Jamison said, and accelerated during the 1960s with the rise of 
center-pivot irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, lesser prairie chickens do not seem to adapt to  
cropland. Of approximately 70 nests found in the Kansas study, only 
one was in a crop field. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet loss of habitat appears to be only one piece of the puzzle.  
</P>
<P>
	Researcher Tom Walker said the bird's numbers have continued to  
decline in recent years despite the fact that grassland no longer 
is being converted to cropland. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor in the decline of the lesser prairie chicken is  
the bird's susceptibility to predators, particularly as chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison said about half of all chicks are eaten by such  
predators as snakes, coyotes, skunks and hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the McDonald's of the prairie. Everything eats them,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overgrazing poses a problem for the bird's habitat in other  
states, Jamison said, but it does not appear to be troublesome in 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers plan to complete their study in August and publish  
their results. A new three-year study scheduled to start next 
spring will seek to develop land management strategies to preserve 
the habitat of the prairie chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, based in Boulder,  
Colo., petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the 
lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. Last year, the 
federal agency made the bird a candidate for future listing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biology tells us that the bird is in serious enough shape  
that it does warrant listing as threatened, but there are more 
species that need help first,'' said Erich Langer, outreach 
coordinator for the agency's field office in Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a way to keep the bird off the list is one of the goals  
of the Kansas research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new way of dealing with things. What we're trying to do  
is jump in and be proactive,'' said Roger Applegate, who is 
coordinating the studies for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Naming the lesser prairie chicken a threatened species most  
likely would ban hunting of the bird. Colorado, New Mexico and 
Oklahoma already have closed their hunting seasons, and Jamison 
said extending this ban to Kansas would alienate a group of the 
bird's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison noted that an excise tax on sporting guns and ammunition  
helped pay for the first Kansas study, and Applegate said it also 
will help fund the second study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunting is not the cause of the decline,'' said Curran Salter,  
another researcher working on the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate agreed, noting that Colorado has experienced  
population declines even though it banned hunting of the bird 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Extinction also would be a blow to bird watchers, who enjoy  
observing the lesser prairie chicken's colorful courtship ritual 
each spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The males gather at breeding grounds where they strut and leap  
to gain the attention of prospective mates. The male courtship 
ritual also includes inflating their pink throat sacs and emitting 
loud noises, which explains why breeding areas often are called 
booming grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every spring, people come from all over the world,'' said  
Jasper Carlton, executive director of the Biodiversity Legal 
Foundation. ``What I fear is that they are coming to see the last 
ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal wildlife officials say they are doing  
everything they can to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's field office in Manhattan  
recently received $75,000 to encourage landowners to enter into 
voluntary agreements to help restore the bird's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Gill, field supervisor for the Ecological Services Division  
at the Manhattan office, said many landowners have expressed 
interest in the program, although no agreements have been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Williams, secretary of the Kansas Department of Wildlife  
and Parks, said he is optimistic about the bird's ability to bounce 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the prospects are good,'' he said. ``The species has a  
lot of attention now. Partnerships are being created between states 
and landowners.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Wins Fake Faulkner Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Samuel Tumey's winning entry in the 1999  
Faulkner write-alike contest, picked by judges John Berendt, Barry 
Hannah, George Plimpton and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
	Where the Southern Crosses the Dog  
</P>
<P>
	There was, not since time immemorial, but beyond the memory of  
the oldest snaggle-toothed farmer, the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley 
Railroad down from Memphis and God-forsaken points North, through 
lifeless cotton barrens past the up-staring soulless faces at the 
State Prison then over the pestilential sloughs of the Yazoo Basin 
and across the Big Black (a dozen times before Jackson) then down 
the imperceptible and unspoken-of divide toward the orphan Land of 
Bienville, relic of every European empire worthy of the name and 
tacked onto the new territory as an afterthought, but before the 
War there was no Greenville, or rather not where it belonged but 
downstream, and after a few gunboats got sniped at there was none 
there either and, after the war, came another Greenville, which 
must have been (by the logic of railroad nomenology) about due West 
of Columbus (which hadn't ever moved) so the Columbus and 
Greenville came after the War (because otherwise it wouldn't have 
run to Greenville) and the train just backed into Greenville 
because it couldn't turn around, but before it was the Columbus and 
Greenville, it was the Southern Railroad of Mississippi, and now 
what's left just belongs to a holding company up North (though 
little boys thought ICG stood for Illinois, Columbus and 
Greenville) and the Y&AMP;MV was long since bought up also -- but time 
was it was just the Yellow Dog line, and undoubtedly, if you 
studied at it hard enough, you could find out whether it was from 
the color or the caboose or what, though in time people forgot what 
the Southern was and what the Dog was, but the words had such a 
ring to them that people remembered that the Southern had crossed 
it once somewhere in some fabled land lost along with Earl Van Dorn 
and Yazoo Pass and all the rest, and it turned out that it was over 
at Moorhead -- which was not fabled or even where anybody much 
wanted to go, but if you had to go there, or if you had an 
obsession to find the very place that your mother had told you 
about (or maybe if you worked for a Yankee newspaper) you could 
find a green sign that says this is the only right angle railroad 
crossing in all the civilized world and there was once a time when 
a train bound from Greenville to Columbus actually crossed here 
while one from Memphis waited (or more likely the reverse) and then 
all the railroad companies bought lemon groves and sold women's 
underwear and ran gambling joints and went broke, and the last 
thing a railroad executive wanted to do was run trains so they took 
up the track, and people will not likely bow their heads for the 
lost railroads, but more likely scratch them in puzzlement over the 
contraption remaining there, but if your grandfather was alive, he 
would nod his and say: So this is where the Southern crosses the 
Dog.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Fly Europe Cheap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISHOP'S STORTFORD, Britain (AP) -- David Leport flaunted his  
boarding pass like a card shark with a winning hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineering student paid all of $27 for a round-trip ticket  
home to Dinard, France, on the regional airline Ryanair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It costs me more to park my car here for five days than it  
does to take this flight,'' Leport, 25, said recently at Stansted 
Airport north of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Leport, a growing number of Europeans are traveling to and  
from small, often remote airports in order to save big money on 
international flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-cost airlines spawned by the recent deregulation of Europe's  
aviation industry are able to offer cheaper fares by avoiding many 
of the costlier, big-city airports favored by their larger rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	While British Airways flies from Heathrow and Gatwick, London's  
two main airports, newcomer easyJet operates from a much smaller 
airport in the outlying town of Luton, 32 miles north of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France serves Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris,  
but low-cost carrier Debonair flies to Cergy Pontoise, a 
little-used airport in an industrial zone of the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	These second-tier airports can be an hour's drive from the  
nearest big city. Yet the surge in flights suggests that 
bargain-hunters are only too happy to fly to them, even if it means 
connecting to their final destinations by bus or train. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no queues for taxis and no queues for check-in.  
There's just not the same stress level as at the bigger, more 
congested airports,'' said Ethel Power, a spokeswoman for 
Dublin-based Ryanair. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by Southwest Airlines and other low-cost U.S. carriers,  
the regional upstarts are attracting customers despite their 
no-frills service and spotty record for punctuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the new airlines are based in Britain, where aviation  
authorities have been among the strongest supporters of the 
deregulation that began in Europe in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trying to steal market share from established  
airlines. What they're trying to do is stimulate additional demand 
that wouldn't have been there otherwise, through the introduction 
of low fares,'' said Guy Kekwick, an analyst in London with the 
U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-cost airlines making short, regional flights command less  
than 5 percent of Europe's aviation market, but they're growing 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger traffic at Luton Airport, home to easyJet and  
Debonair, has increased by almost a third in each of the past two 
years. EasyJet had two flights a day when it began operating from 
Luton in 1995; today, it has 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Stansted, 35 miles north of London in Bishop's Stortford, has  
seen similar rates of growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some big carriers such as Lufthansa and Alitalia, are responding  
with plans for similar low-cost subsidiaries of their own. British 
Airways' entry into the market is called Go. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners from this trend are customers.  
</P>
<P>
	Debonair, for example, flies from Luton to Rome for a round-trip  
fare of $188. By comparison, a typical economy-class ticket on a 
Lufthansa flight from Heathrow Airport to Rome costs $306. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct comparisons with fares on U.S. domestic flights are hard  
to make, due to the myriad special fares possible for flights on 
both sides of the Atlantic. But air travel has typically cost less 
in the United States than in Europe, largely because deregulation 
of the American airline industry began some 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	To help keeps fares to a minimum, the low-cost carriers have  
stripped their in-flight service to its bare essentials, making 
passengers pay for drinks and forgoing in-flight meals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever gives you champagne on the bus. Why are consumers  
brought up to expect that on a plane?'' said easyJet spokesman 
James Rothnie. 
</P>
<P>
	Strict regulations in Europe discourage low-cost airlines from  
cutting corners on safety. The downside to flying with them is 
suggested by anecdotal evidence of delays and penalties for 
changing departure dates. 
</P>
<P>
	But independents like easyJet and Debonair say their fortunes  
hinge on whether they can compete with the low-cost subsidiaries of 
the big airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	And because they fly along some of the same routes, competition  
between the smaller airlines is all the more intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shared madness,'' said Franco Mancassola, Debonair's  
founder and chief executive. ``This business could thrive for all 
of us, even the little guys, if we allow it to develop with 
intelligence instead of trying to muscle each other away from 
routes.''

<HEADLINE> Gere Doesn't Mind Hitting 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard Gere is fast approaching the  
half-century mark, but that doesn't make him feel old. He sees the 
milestone as a new beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels fine,'' Gere says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I'm  
thinking that I should do something special on that day, so I'm 
trying to figure out what. There's certainly nothing negative 
associated with it at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I always said certain things are going to be happening  
when I turn 50, and I would probably be leaving this behind in some 
way. Which I think I probably will, metaphysically and mentally, 
and be moving on to some other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One ``other thing'' he'll be taking on is fatherhood. He  
recently announced girlfriend Carrie Lowell, a former ``Law and 
Order'' cast member, is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Gere, whose 50th birthday is Aug. 31, stars in the upcoming film  
``Runaway Bride,'' reuniting on screen with ``Pretty Woman'' costar 
Julia Roberts.

<HEADLINE> Handyman Arrested in Park Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Photos upcoming    	
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A hotel maintenance man was arrested  
in the beheading of a naturalist at Yosemite National Park and is a 
suspect in the killings of three park sightseers earlier this year, 
the FBI said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner was accused of killing Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26,  
whose decapitated body was found near her Yosemite housing on 
Thursday. The 37-year-old man was arrested Saturday at a nudist 
colony and is scheduled be arraigned Monday on a charge of murder 
in a national park, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who was questioned at the time of the three previous  
slayings but ruled out as a suspect, is now believed to have played 
a role in those crimes, said Special Agent in Charge James M. 
Maddock. The bodies of Carole Sund, her daughter Juli, and family 
friend Silvina Pelosso of Argentina were discovered in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have developed specific information linking Stayner to the  
Sund-Pelosso murders,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stayner name already is indelibly etched in the annals of  
California crime. 
</P>
<P>
	His brother, Steven Stayner, was a sexually abused kidnap victim  
who was abducted off a Merced street in 1972. The boy was reunited 
with his family seven years later. But as if he lived his short 
life under a cloud, Steven Stayner died in 1989 in a collision with 
a hit-and-run driver at 24. 
</P>
<P>
	A television miniseries later portrayed the saga of his  
abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner was last seen Thursday night by friends and  
coworkers at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal, where he works as a 
handyman. He was taken into custody by federal authorities Saturday 
morning at a nudist colony in Wilton, near Sacramento, after a 
person recognized him from news reports and called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Armstrong's body was discovered a few hundred yards from the  
park housing she shared with a man and woman, who were away at the 
time. A park official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told 
The Associated Press the woman had been decapitated. 
</P>
<P>
	She was last seen alive Wednesday at the park offices of  
Yosemite Institute, where she worked. The institute's main offices 
are in El Portal -- on the outskirts of Yosemite -- and the 
organization has held conferences at the Cedar Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
	El Portal is also the town where the victims in the previous  
slayings were last seen alive in February during a sightseeing 
trip. The three women stayed at the Cedar Lodge, where Stayner has 
rented a room above the restaurant for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hired there in August 1997 and was laid off in January of  
this year because of a slowdown in business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was rehired March 20, a day after Mrs. Sund's and Silvina's  
bodies were found in the trunk of their rental car. Juli's body was 
later found hidden off a lightly traveled highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of Carole Sund, Carole and Francis Carrington, were  
at the FBI's press conference Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy that it looks like maybe the case is over,''  
Carole Carrington said after the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings some closure, no question,'' her husband said.  
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents had previously said they had zeroed in on a  
loose-knit group of methamphetamine users in connection with the 
sightseers case and were confident that some of those responsible 
are already behind bars on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In light of the new development, Maddock said they would be  
reevaluating the possible roles of others who have come under 
scrutiny in the sightseers case. There is no evidence linking 
Stayner to those people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at whether (Stayner) is solely responsible (for  
the sightseers murders) or if others are involved,'' Maddock said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddock also said he has asked himself if the FBI could have  
done anything to prevent Armstrong's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I struggled with that issue for the last 24 hours and I  
continue to do so,'' he said. ``I'm confident we've done everything 
that reasonably could have been done.''

<HEADLINE> Guinea Fowl Enlisted in Lyme Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, N.Y. (AP) -- Bob Masciarelli's guinea fowl are fighting  
Lyme disease on his front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck. Peck. Peck.  
</P>
<P>
	Birds nip at the turf, strut a bit, then bury their beaks again.  
Peck. Peck. 
</P>
<P>
	All day.  
</P>
<P>
	The guinea fowl are ridding Masciarelli's Hudson Valley property  
of the ticks that carry Lyme disease by eating them. At least 
that's the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking a bit like chicken-sized vultures, the guinea fowl are  
not pretty and their loud cackle has a nails-on-chalkboard quality. 
But as ticks continue to spread Lyme disease in verdant areas of 
the Northeast and elsewhere, Mascierelli and many others claim the 
birds are worth the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a pain in the neck, but they do the job,'' he said.  
``I've got dogs, I've got cats, I've got horses here, and my tick 
population is down to zilch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such raves have driven a demand for guinea fowl beyond their  
more traditional role as gourmet entree (they're supposed to taste 
like pheasant). A new generation of guinea fowl chicks called 
``keets'' are now ready for market, and retailers report brisk 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a growing business year by year,'' said Louise Dente,  
owner of Bedford Village Pets in Westchester County. Dente expects 
to sell 300 keets this summer, up 100 from last year. Dente sells 
to homeowners in New York and neighboring Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory is that since Lyme disease comes from bacteria  
carried by the deer tick, placing guinea fowl on lawn patrol takes 
away a link in a chain that has infected some 128,000 people 
nationwide since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Does it work? A consensus answer is that the fowl may indeed  
help, but they are not a silver bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Using guineas to control ticks and bugs is nothing new, people  
have been doing it forever,'' said Jeannette Ferguson, author of 
the guidebook ``Gardening With Guineas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferguson has tested the birds' taste for ticks by plucking them  
off dogs and watching keets eat them up. Further evidence comes 
from her Waynesville, Ohio, farm, where ticks have been scarce 
since she began keeping the birds. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ferguson agreed with Jacqueline Jacob, a poultry expert  
at the University of Florida, who cautioned against relying on 
guinea fowl for ``100 percent cleanup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Weld, executive director of the American Lyme Disease  
Foundation, was aware of no relevant research but added: ``There's 
no way I can say it doesn't help.'' The foundation's Web site 
offers more traditional preventive measures, like wearing 
light-colored clothing and using insect repellents. 
</P>
<P>
	Even guinea fowl-owner Masciarelli said he still checks his  
family for ticks when they come in from the yard. Occasionally, 
he'll find one. 
</P>
<P>
	On the plus side, the birds require little care once they are  
fully grown and can roost outside all summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some owners like Ferguson will give them year-round shelter.  
That helps keep the birds safe from roaming dogs and foxes -- 
animals with a well-known taste for poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	There are problems, too. Masciarelli's flock of nine birds have  
scratched up parts of his lawn hunting for grubs. One hen attacked 
his face when he got too close to its eggs. Ungodly cackles can be 
heard in the middle of the night when the birds are alarmed -- a 
trait that has earned guinea fowl the nickname ``farmers' 
watchdog.''

<HEADLINE>  39-year-old Johnny Gray Wins 800 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- With Princess Anne in attendance,  
Johnny Gray performed royally and regally. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Gray shook off questions about his age and a  
younger Norberto Tellez of Cuba to win the 800 meters at the Pan 
American Games on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public dwells in your head that you're too old and you're  
supposed to believe it,'' Gray said. ``I don't. To have held up the 
way I did today shows that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dogged Tellez, 27, matched Gray stride-for-stride down the  
final straightaway. At the end, it was Gray's lean that gave him 
the edge by .02 seconds in a season-best and games record 1:45.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the judges took a couple of minutes to determine the  
winner, Gray began his victory lap around the packed University of 
Manitoba stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my experience, you take the victory lap and they'll give  
it to you,'' Gray said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Gray's second Pan Am title; his first was in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a better runner and in better shape than I was then,'' he  
said. ``I struggled to run 1:46 then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the elder statesmen of the sport, Gray is held in awe by  
many of the younger runners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, `Mr. Gray, it's an honor to line up with you,' '' he  
said. '' `I was 7 years old when I saw you in the 1984 Olympic 
Games. Because of you guys (the media) saying that I'm 39, I can't 
tell them that I'm 29 anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has been in four Olympics, winning the bronze medal in  
1992. He had not run as well this year because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great that I had that test today, because now I know  
I'm ready,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Cuba's delegation claimed its athletes are being  
encouraged to defect through the Canadian media. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, a Cuban athlete and a journalist have defected, and  
Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, 
said ``our delegation is very upset about publications inciting 
Cuban athletes to desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before the  
games. Sources said Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has sought 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans are annoyed by stories that have appeared in the  
Winnipeg Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' Fernandez said. ``The Cuban delegation 
does not accept these methods, which are contrary to the spirit of 
friendship and hospitality with which the Canadian people have 
received us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez was most angry about a statement signed by Enrico  
Blanco, a boxer who left Cuba in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is here now, inciting desertion,'' Fernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Bernard Williams ended the 12-year U.S. drought in  
the men's 100. Tim Harden, the more heralded of the two Americans 
in the 100, was last out of the blocks and never compltely 
recovered, finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra Sturrup gave the Bahamas its first-ever Pan Am track  
gold, overtaking NCAA champion Angela Williams of Southern 
California to win the women's 100 in 11.10. Sturrup trains with 
Marion Jones, the world's No. 1 sprinter, at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams nearly didn't run. She aggravated a hamstring while  
warming up and the U.S. team trainer told her not to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Huffins, the two-time U.S. champion in the decathlon, set  
a games record in beating teammate Daniel Steele by 100 points with 
a score of 8,170 points. The score was one of Huffins' worst in 
years, and he blamed it on the officials, claiming some races were 
run in the wrong wind direction to accommodate television. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they did for the cameras didn't help the scores at all,''  
he said. ``My score is not indicative of the efforts I put in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's career-best 8,070 qualified him for next month's world  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men's winners were Jamaica's Greg Haughton in the 400;  
Vanderlei Lima of Brazil in the marathon; and Joel Bourgeois of 
Canada in the 3,000-meter steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other women's events, Letitia Vriesde won the 800 for  
Surinam's first-ever track and field gold at the games, upsetting 
American Meredith Rainey Valmon; Mexico's Ana Guevera took the 400; 
Erika Olivera became the first Chilean marathoner to win a Pan Am 
medal with a games record 2:37:41; Mexico's Adriana Fernandez won 
her second straight 5,000 title; Argentina's Alejandra Garcia took 
the games' first pole vault for women; and Osleidys Menendez of 
Cuba won the javelin at 216-0, also a Pan Am record. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. men's track coach Ralph Lindeman, 48, was hospitalized  
Saturday night with chest pains. Dr. Dan Carr, had physician at the 
athletes village, said Lindeman was being held for observation 
Sunday at Victoria Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday were the finals in men's individual gymnastics and  
Greco-Roman wrestling.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Firm Selling Hawaii Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- After spending tens of millions of dollars to  
build a sophisticated fiber-optic network connecting Hawaii's six 
largest islands, GST Telecommunications Inc. has announced plans to 
pull out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver, Wash.-based company said Friday it is soliciting  
offers for its main Hawaii assets. Industry experts have identified 
AT&AMP;T Corp. and Sprint Corp. as potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	GST and Oceanic Communications are the only companies that use  
their own wire-based networks to compete with GTE Hawaiian Tel, the 
state's dominant carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the inter-island network, GST provides phone  
service to local businesses and operates an Internet service 
provider, GST Hawaii OnLine. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Steve Kuyatt said it is not known whether the  
online operation will be included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuyatt said GST's Hawaii pullout is part of a strategic decision  
to concentrate on its core market, the Western United States. As 
part of the strategy, GST also is selling its telecommunications 
operations on Guam for undisclosed amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint is buying GST's equipment network on Guam and Startec  
Global Communications Corp. is acquiring GST's customer base there. 
</P>
<P>
	GST's decision to leave Hawaii surprised industry officials  
because of the company's extensive investments in the state. In 
late 1996, GST's then-president, John Warta, said the company 
intended to spend $49 million to $54 million over the next two 
years to build its inter-island fiber network. Kuyatt said Thursday 
that the projections weren't off the mark, but declined to give 
specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Warta, a key proponent of GST's push into the Hawaii market,  
left the company last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GST had plans to eventually go head-to-head with Hawaiian Tel in  
business and residential markets. Over the past two years GST had 
been slowly building its land-based network on Oahu and Maui, but 
had not launched residential service. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old company sells integrated communications services  
to small and medium-sized businesses in seven other states: 
Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico and 
Texas.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Wins Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong rode to victory in the Tour de  
France on Sunday, capping an amazing comeback from cancer and 
becoming just the second American to win cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	Near death two years ago, Armstrong sprinted to the finish line  
on the Champs-Elysees to claim the inspirational victory that had 
seemed certain for days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emotion is incredible,'' the smiling Texan said. ``I never  
expected to be here. I never expected to win. It's a wonderful 
feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The finish under brilliant skies couldn't have been more  
different from last year's. The 1998 race ended in rain after a 
disastrous drug scandal nearly ended the event and placed the 
entire sport under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Armstrong was dogged in the last three weeks by  
accusations in the French media that he used performance-enhancing 
drugs. Many people couldn't believe that a cyclist recovering from 
testicular cancer could prevail in one of the most grueling 
competitions in all of sports. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no proof, however. The sport's ruling body, which  
tests the cyclists during the race, said the only drug Armstrong 
used was an approved prescription cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory was simply a remarkable example of grit and  
determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor,'' Armstrong said of his victory ride into  
Paris. ``For American cycling, and for the cancer community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the Tour de France was Greg  
LeMond, a three-time champion whose last victory came in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's mother, Linda, was shaking and waving a small U.S.  
flag as she watched her son wave from the winner's podium. She 
called his cancer a ``minor setback,'' and said ``it was never in 
our minds'' that he wouldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong went into the audience to hug and kiss his wife,  
Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked so hard to get this,'' she said. ``He deserves it,  
every last bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong had a commanding 7-minute, 37-second lead over his top  
rival, Alex Zulle of Switzerland, going into the 20th and final 
stage, and only a disastrous fall could have denied him victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was won by Australia's Robbie McEwen. He edged  
Germany's Erik Zabel in a furious sprint. Armstrong finished 86th -- 
in the 86th Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Armstrong won the race's final time trial just as  
convincingly as he'd won the other two in the race, further 
cementing his lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 27, was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1996, and  
the disease spread to his brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	After four rounds of chemotherapy and two operations -- one to  
remove a testicle and one for brain lesions -- he began his comeback 
early last year. His doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer 
will return. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to Armstrong's Tour de France victory was his  
ability to master the challenging mountain climbs that had always 
given him trouble. After he easily won the first stage in the Alps, 
he became the prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Zulle finished second in the overall standings, and Spain's  
Fernando Escartin came in third at 10 minutes, 26 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's stage was a fairly easy 89-mile ride from Arpajon up to  
Paris, and then past many of the city's grandest sights: the 
Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens with their giant summer ferris wheel, 
the arcaded Rue de Rivoli, the Place de la Concorde with its 
Egyptian obelisk, and then up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de 
Triomphe for a loop that was repeated 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the stage, it was a time for humor and  
camaraderie in the pack. French national champion Francois Simon 
had dyed his hair the red-white-and-blue of his jersey. And not 
only was Armstrong clad in the yellow shirt of the leader, his 
wheel was, too, spokes and all. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Armstrong was to lose that newly decorated wheel to a  
puncture, but his loyal teammates on the U.S. Postal Service team 
helped him back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked as he rode off whether he ever imagined he'd achieve this  
victory after being so ill, he replied: ``No, never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race was disappointing for the home country. French cyclists  
did not win a stage for the first time since 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was a huge boost for American cycling. Even when LeMond  
won the race, it was not with an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old U.S. Postal Service team had been euphoric  
throughout the race. Early on, team managing director Mark Gorski 
called an overall victory akin to a team of French players winning 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong was most concerned about what the victory would  
mean for cancer survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it sends out a fantastic message to all survivors  
around the world,'' he said. ``We can return to what we were before 
-- and even better.''

<HEADLINE> Rogers Introduced, Beltran Demoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In his first attempt at pitching with a New York  
baseball team, Kenny Rogers had a mediocre record with the Yankees. 
He's confident things will change with the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a little different because it's the National League  
and I've never been a National League pitcher before,'' Rogers said 
Sunday. ``But when I'm healthy I've proven that I'm a pretty good 
pitcher. ... one of the best in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, 34, who was 5-3 with a 4.30 ERA in 19 starts with  
Oakland this year, was traded to the Mets on Friday for minor 
leaguers Terrence Long and Leoner Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
	In his two seasons with the Yankees in 1996 and 1997, Rogers was  
18-15 with a 5.16 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first year I thought I was pretty good,'' Rogers said,  
referring to the 1996 season when he was 12-8 with a 4.68 ERA in 30 
starts. ``But I look at it for myself because I want to do better 
here. The key is staying healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opinions varied on Rogers' effort in New York two seasons ago.  
Some thought he was pitching with a bad shoulder, while others 
believed he felt too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a little too coincidental to say there was too  
much pressure,'' Rogers said. ``My second year, I was pretty much 
in limbo for most of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Rogers on their 25-man roster, the Mets  
optioned left-handed reliever Rigo Beltran to Triple-A Norfolk 
before the start of Sunday night's game with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Rogers was 16-8 with an 11-0 record at the Oakland  
Coliseum, becoming the first pitcher to go undefeated at home since 
Tommy Green was 10-0 at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	With his trade to the Mets, the left-hander rejoined manger  
Bobby Valentine, who managed Rogers during his first season in the 
majors with Texas in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he planned to give Rogers his first start  
Wednesday, when the Mets conclude a three-game series with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. But a tight right hamstring might cause Rogers' 
NL debut to be pushed back to Friday at Chicago's Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go out and do something like this, you want to make  
sure it fits,'' Valentine said. ``I think he'll fit. He's a good 
athlete and he knows how to pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets are looking for another pitcher to come out of the  
bullpen, but are satisfied with what Rogers might be able to give 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Rogers) is a quality left-handed pitcher,'' said Mets  
outfielder Brian McRae. ``There aren't a lot of lefties out there 
who are durable and can give you a lot of innings like he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beltran was 1-1 with a 3.48 ERA in 21 appearances with the Mets  
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was happy when I heard (the Mets) got another starter,''  
said Beltran, who had been demoted to the minors three times before 
Sunday. ``But it's tough for me because I feel like I was doing the 
job here.''

<HEADLINE> Columbia, Mir Crews Chat in Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia's astronauts  
took a break early Sunday to chat with the only other humans in 
orbit -- the three men aboard Russian space station Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio chat was to be a conversation between Frenchmen Michel  
Tognini on Columbia and Jean-Pierre Haignere on Mir, but Mir's 
commander broke in to greet his counterpart on the shuttle, Eileen 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Afanasyev congratulated Collins on becoming the first  
woman to command a U.S. space flight. After first trying to say it 
in English, Afanasyev settled for eloquence in his mother tongue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart,''  
Afanasyev said in Russian. ``You are a courageous woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Spasibo,'' Collins replied, thanking him in Russian. She has  
visited Mir twice, in 1995 and 1997, when she served as a shuttle 
co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The space travelers chatted in French, Russian and English  
across a ham radio link for about 10 minutes as Mir and Columbia 
soared some 7,700 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
	It was something of a reunion for Tognini and Mir cosmonaut  
Sergei Avdeyev -- both spent two weeks aboard Mir in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again we're flying together,'' Tognini said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see each other but we can imagine each other,''  
Avdeyev responded. 
</P>
<P>
	Tognini congratulated Avdeyev, who holds the record for the most  
time in space -- 714 days over three flights. When Avdeyev returns 
to Earth at the end of August, he will have been on Mir for more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The conversation was a short break for the Columbia astronauts,  
who were spending their third day in space performing various 
scientific experiments. The experiments remain the focus for the 
crew members, who completed their main objective Friday by 
releasing the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory into space. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday, the first of five engine firings to boost  
Chandra's orbit was performed successfully. Another four rocket 
firings -- the next of which is scheduled for Sunday night -- will 
put the world's most powerful X-ray telescope in an orbit extending 
one-third of the way to the moon.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Efforts in 2 Other Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Timelines for the rescue and recovery efforts for two downed  
pilots -- one in Northern California, one in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Trenton crash:  
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 11, 1997 -- Ron Trenton flies 35 miles from San Diego to  
Santa Catalina Island and begins return flight at about 3 p.m. At 
3:19, his plane disappears from radar. First word of his 
disappearance goes out at 8:35 p.m. when a friend tells authorities 
Trenton's plane is overdue. At 8:45 p.m., Coast Guard launches 
first helicopter followed by several boats. The air search is 
suspended at 2:30 a.m. until first light, but boats keep working 
through the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 12, 1997 -- 2,000-square-mile search area is narrowed to 100  
square miles. Four Coast Guard helicopters, six airplanes and five 
boats saturate the area. The Navy lends two ships in the area to 
the rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 13, 1997 -- Coast Guard talks to family about ending search.  
Holding out hope, the Trenton family asks that the search continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 14, 1997 -- Coast Guard continues search, investigates  
report of an oil sheen on the surface of ocean that turns out to be 
false. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 15, 1997 -- Search for Trenton ends.  

</P>
<P>
	Robert Beach Crash:  
</P>
<P>
	May 22, 1998 -- Robert Beach takes off from Half Moon Bay at  
about 9 p.m. Twelve minutes later, witnesses report seeing two 
white lights spinning into the ocean or hearing a loud splash. 
Coast Guard sends emergency broadcast to area boaters and pilots to 
look out for survivors and debris at 9:18 p.m., launches helicopter 
and boats at 9:19. Air search suspended for the night at 1:30 a.m., 
but boats continue patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	May 23, 1998 -- Unable to confirm crash, Coast Guard suspends  
search at 7:37 a.m. Resumes at 11:15 p.m. after missing person's 
report is filed and debris reported recovered on beach. Coast Guard 
launches three boats and two helicopters, the local harbor master 
uses his boat and county and local police deploy two airplanes to 
search for the men. 
</P>
<P>
	May 24, 1998 -- Airplane insulation and a Walkman are washed  
ashore and a severed foot in a shoe is also found on the beach. 
Coast Guard continues to search into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	May 25, 1998 -- After talking with Beach's family, the Coast  
Guard ends the search, assuming the pilot is dead.

<HEADLINE> Disorientation Eyed As Crash Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- It's nearly impossible for a non-pilot to  
understand the phenomenon of spatial disorientation, so confusing 
to aviators that some have flown nearly upside down for miles 
without realizing it. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest civilian sensation is Walt Disney World's Space  
Mountain roller coaster, said James Davidson, a pilot and president 
of ATC Flight Training Center in Fort Washington, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going very fast through pitch-dark tunnels and you  
can't tell what direction you're going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another comparison, he said, is the sensation of lying on a bed  
after drinking too much alcohol. The room spins around, and one 
must put a hand on a wall to steady oneself. 
</P>
<P>
	Spatial disorientation occurs when a pilot loses the horizon,  
and conditions were ripe for such a phenomenon during the last 
flight of John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	It was night, he was flying over the sea, there were no land  
lights to guide him, it was hazy and there was no moon -- perfect 
conditions for the sky and the ocean to blend into a dark tunnel 
with no boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Spatial disorientation is blamed for more than 90 percent of  
inexperienced pilot crashes, and it is being examined as a possible 
cause of the July 16 crash that killed Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, off the coast of 
Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	In the absence of radio transmissions from Kennedy, the cause of  
the crash may never be conclusively known. 
</P>
<P>
	But pilots around the country say the combination of Kennedy's  
inexperience -- he was qualified only to fly visually and not using 
instruments -- and the poor visibility over the Atlantic that night 
points to a classic case of spatial disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Radar painted a fairly definitive picture of Kennedy's flight  
from Fairfield, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard aboard his single-engine 
Piper Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	His takeoff and the first leg of his flight along Long Island  
Sound apparently were uneventful. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the plane left behind the lights of Westerly, R.I., it  
entered an area where other pilots who were in the air that night 
said the horizon was extremely difficult to detect. 
</P>
<P>
	About 34 miles west of the Martha's Vineyard airport at West  
Tisbury, Kennedy's plane began a slightly fast, but still normal, 
descent of 700 feet per minute, eventually going from 5,600 feet 
above sea level to 2,300 feet in five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 miles from the airport, he banked toward the right and  
climbed to 2,600 feet, perhaps just as added insurance to make sure 
he was fully set for his approach, or perhaps because he was having 
trouble with the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	He flew at that altitude for about a minute.  
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear from official reports if he then began descending  
again, but at about 17 miles from West Tisbury, he took a sudden 
right turn, away from the airport, and the plane began dropping at 
the hazardous rate of 5,000 feet per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in that maneuver, aviation experts speculate, that  
Kennedy exhibited signs of spatial disorientation, putting the 
plane into a dive as he tried to right himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In spatial disorientation, a pilot can actually be in a dive and  
believe he is flying level. 
</P>
<P>
	This may have been an ``unfeelable bank,'' said William  
Langewiesche, a pilot with 15,000 cockpit hours, in which Kennedy 
might not have known if his craft were pointed toward sea or sky. 
</P>
<P>
	And a plane, unlike a car, does not easily compensate.  
</P>
<P>
	``A plane is not directionally stable,'' said Langewiesche,  
author of ``Inside the Sky: A Meditation on Flight.'' ``Whatever 
the reason that you went into a bank is precisely the reason you 
won't come out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was considered a conscientious pilot who witnesses said  
never intended to fly at night, but he also was in a dangerous 
category -- having only logged between 100 and 200 hours of flight 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a time when you think you are better than you are,''  
Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``An experienced pilot would never have gotten into this  
situation,'' Langewiesche said. ``(Kennedy) was a babe in the 
woods.''

<HEADLINE> Governors Waffle on 'Happiness' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- In politics, edgy issues are perennially divisive,  
but who knew happiness was a politically sensitive theme? 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Johnson had no idea -- until she got a volley of waffling  
replies with her request for all 50 U.S. governors to declare Aug. 
8 ``National Admit You're Happy Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no official position on happiness,'' hedged a letter  
from New York Gov. George Pataki. ``We're going to wait and see 
what the federal government and other governors do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson, founder of the Secret Society of Happy People,  
proposed the day of observance as part of her ongoing campaign to 
drag contentment out of the closet. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced that happiness has fallen out of fashion in the  
therapy-driven, angst-ridden 1990s, Ms. Johnson wages her 
unorthodox battle from her suburban Dallas apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our culture doesn't know what to do anymore with expressions  
of happiness,'' she said Saturday. ``It's like a foreign language 
to us -- we rush to get it, and then we don't have anybody to 
tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson dreamed up this summer's holiday to draw more  
attention to the society's cause -- but a scant 15 governors have 
agreed to declare Aug. 8 a day of admitted bliss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen did not issue a proclamation or had no society members  
in their states, earning ``stick in the mud'' or ``parade raining'' 
titles from Ms. Johnson. An additional 17 state leaders, have not 
responded, she said. New York remained noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time the society president has locked  
horns with notables in the name of promoting contentment: During 
the holiday season, Ms. Johnson took Ann Landers to task after the 
advice guru opposed the ever-popular holiday letters that detail 
families' successes. 
</P>
<P>
	To Ms. Johnson, Ms. Landers' advice represented another  
intolerant strike against happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pressure to keep happiness to yourself,'' she said.  
``At work you're not supposed to like your boss or your job, and 
with your friends you're not supposed to brag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing prepared the peppy Texan for the response to the day  
of national contentment she envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll need to check with our attorneys,'' ran the reply from  
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the notoriously offbeat Jesse Ventura -- former professional  
wrestler and present governor of Minnesota -- refused to bite. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represents the people of Minnesota, and he really doesn't  
see how this affects them,'' Ventura's office told Ms. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Saturday, fellow Texan and presidential hopeful George W.  
Bush was among the 17 governors who had not responded to the 
request, Ms. Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though bemused by the reaction, the society's founder is  
steaming ahead with plans for the holiday. There will be a party, 
of course, as well as an open invitation to muse out loud over 
life's pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really bizarre-- it's not like I proposed a `Take Your  
Guns to Work Day,''' Ms. Johnson quipped. ``I meant it to be quite 
the opposite of controversial.''

<HEADLINE> EPA Focuses on Foul Ferries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Durand of Bainbridge Island, Wash., loves  
his daily commute across Puget Sound, where ferry boats cut the 
crisp sea air and offer stunning views of Mount Rainier and 
Seattle's skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be absolutely gorgeous,'' says Durand, a 36-year-old  
manager at a computer software company. ``It's actually a nice way 
to get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a study released this month discloses a darker side of the  
boats that carry millions of passengers in California, Washington, 
Alaska and 32 other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Bluewater Network, a San Francisco-based environmental group,  
says ferries are 10 times more polluting per passenger than 
automobiles and nearly 13 times more polluting than buses. 
</P>
<P>
	While questioned by some, the study has raised eyebrows among  
environmentalists and ferry buffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency also has turned its  
regulatory eye on ferries and other commercial boats. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the EPA is supposed to complete a  
rule in November that for the first time will regulate emissions 
from diesel-powered marine engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule, to take effect in 2006, would allow 7.2 grams per  
kilowatt hour of exhaust emissions that contribute to ozone -- down 
nearly 50 percent from the 13.3 grams per hour the engines now 
emit. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ferry riders are aware of the black smoke that comes from  
ferry smokestacks but assume the vessels are good for the 
environment on the whole because they carry hundreds of people who 
otherwise might drive cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The study highlights a trend among environmental groups  
increasingly focusing public attention on the down side of 
unconventional modes of transportation such as personal 
water-craft, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferries ``may have gotten a free pass'' as environmental groups  
looked at pollution resulting from cars and sport utility vehicles, 
said Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ferry engines may deserve scrutiny,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bluewater Network used emission and ridership data for cars,  
buses and a popular ferry route in San Francisco to conclude that 
diesel buses emit pollutants of 0.63 grams per passenger mile, cars 
emit 0.80 grams per passenger mile, and diesel ferries emit 7.90 
grams per passenger mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Long, the group's executive director, said that while he  
expected ferries to pollute more than buses or cars, he was shocked 
by the extent of the difference -- and a little saddened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame we have to deromanticize the ferry as a result of  
this,'' he said. ``They're an elegant way to travel to and from 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ferries carry 100 million passengers each year in 35 states,  
according to the International Marine Transit Association, a ferry 
group in Hingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges and cars put many ferries out of business earlier this  
century, but the boats have been getting more popular in recent 
years due to gridlock, new waterfront developments and ``fast 
ferries'' that can travel more than 30 mph, said Martha Reardon, 
secretary-treasurer of the ferry group. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very much of a revival,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Russell Hancock, vice president of the Bay Area Council, a  
business group that wants to add 120 fast ferries in San Francisco, 
said marine engines are dirty because it takes far more horsepower 
to move a ferry through choppy waters than it does to push a bus on 
wheels along a smooth road. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hancock contends Bluewater overstated the size of some  
ferries in the San Francisco plan and understated the amount of 
time cars will spend gridlocked in coming years. Increasing traffic 
means cumulative car emissions will escalate, he said.

<HEADLINE> Washington Bids Farewell to Kennedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An estimated 4,500 people gathered Sunday at a  
huge Catholic church in the nation's capital to pay respects to 
John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass honoring the trio killed in an airplane crash July 16  
was held at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate 
Conception, the largest Catholic church in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy ``was a symbol of a generation coming into its own,''  
said the Rev. William E. Lori, Auxiliary Bishop of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``He revered his famous father, shared the life of his famous  
family, yet carved out a path all his own,'' Lori said during the 
homily. ``Carolyn and Lauren, while not so completely in the 
spotlight, were women of accomplishment in their own right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleanor Holmes Norton, District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate  
to the House of Representatives, said she came to the mass because 
Washington ``in many ways is Kennedy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just John F. Kennedy, but this family changed this town,''  
Norton said. ``They came to a Southern town -- not terribly 
cosmopolitan. When they left, they left a world-class city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending was the capital city's mayor, Anthony Williams.  
``Our city represents very much a national service, as well as on 
the local level,'' Williams said. ``John Kennedy contributed to 
that tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mass drew Washingtonians as well as tourists from across the  
country. Some audience members were moved to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been grieving all week. This will bring some closure,''  
said Trudy Gallager, 60, of Falls Church in suburban Virginia. 
``When you grew up in my day, you were told if you were a woman or 
Catholic, you couldn't be president. John Kennedy began to break 
through that.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Security Fights Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- JonnyX says no computer system is unhackable and  
he doubts an impenetrable network could ever be produced. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hacker, who didn't want his real name used, admits it  
would take some serious work to break through a security system 
with a neural network -- computer programs that can remember events 
and ``learn'' trends and tendencies of intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet security researchers at Georgia Tech believe the neural  
networks they are working on may be the key to stopping hackers, 
who have made headlines with recent break-ins at high-profile sites 
such as The New York Times, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a shift in the way people think about  
computers and how they operate before we are ever truly secure,'' 
said Blaine Burnham, a former National Security Administration 
security specialist who now heads Georgia Tech's Information 
Security Center. ``But we've started that process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Georgia Tech's The Sentinel Project doesn't  
``think,'' the group of programs is set up in different ``nodes'' 
much like a human brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are much like neurons or synapses,'' said Jim Cannady, a  
Security Center researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurons in your brain learn from experiences, creating synapses,  
or connections, between one part of the brain and another. The 
neural network works similarly, although it is ``just a rough 
emulation,'' Cannady said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is designed to recognize small increases in abnormal  
data, which could signal that someone has broken into the system. 
The neural networks would also update themselves to fight against 
new approaches hackers attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Current systems require administrators to constantly update  
every possible attack option or system weakness. As hackers try new 
approaches, that list is continually growing, meaning 
administrators are always playing catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Neural networks) would work a little more mysteriously and  
mean you'd have to take a little more on faith, but they would 
streamline the process incredibly,'' said Cannady, who projects a 
usable version within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds interesting, says JonnyX, 31, but he doubts the network  
would keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neural networks would be cool, if they work,'' he said. ``But  
I don't think any system will ever be truly secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best security alternatives now available also came  
from Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by a 1983 science-fiction novel, former Georgia Tech  
student Chris Klaus invented a program that finds the weaknesses in 
a system from within. It allows system operators to see the network 
from a hacker's point of view instead of relying on a standard 
firewall, which attempts to keep all unwanted traffic out of a 
company's network. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we have about 2,000 threats and vulnerabilities on  
our database and the list is continually growing,'' said Klaus, 25, 
who initially released his Internet Security Scanner for free while 
he was a Tech student in 1992. He has since become a 
multimillionaire after starting a computer security company. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the advances made by Klaus' Internet Security  
Systems, researchers and hackers agree that most companies' 
Internet security is woeful. 
</P>
<P>
	JonnyX, who works as a computer consultant in Nashville, Tenn.,  
said most hackers break in just because they can. 
</P>
<P>
	During an Atlanta symposium on hacking earlier this month,  
JonnyX said companies usually ignore security until it's too late, 
then don't press charges against hackers to avoid negative 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are CEOs out there that would rather admit to being a  
pedophile than admit to their shareholders that they've been 
hacked,'' said Jim Butler, an Atlanta attorney specializing in 
Internet and electronic privacy law. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham said it will take a ``Pearl Harbor'' type event such as  
a massive theft of credit card numbers from a site like Amazon.com 
or a wire transfer out of a bank to make companies to improve 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	But programmers and hackers agree that even companies that  
invest in advancements such as neural networks or other programs 
shouldn't let their guard down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are banks totally secure?,'' JonnyX said. ``They've been  
around a long time, and people still rob them. Until the computer 
and the Internet stops being sexy and becomes an everyday household 
appliance, security will remain an issue.''

</P>
<P>
	In several years, AT&AMP;T intends to make high-speed Internet  
access so easy and affordable that millions of Americans will be 
able to enjoy dinner with relatives thousands of miles away, 
through live TV hookups between their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	New technology that combines Internet, telephone and cable TV  
``will provide a foundation for a whole new generation of 
communications, information and entertainment services,'' AT&AMP;T 
chairman C. Michael Armstrong promised a Senate committee earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	With innovations such as these dazzling consumers, will they  
care if AT&AMP;T and a handful of other giant cable companies dominate 
the high-speed Internet business? 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which is spending $100 billion this year to become the  
nation's biggest cable TV company, is betting that they won't -- and 
federal antitrust watchdogs have so far kept hands off. 
</P>
<P>
	But America Online and other Internet companies that now reach  
consumers through slow dial-up phone connections see danger in 
creating a new Ma Cable and her sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	They want government regulators to force AT&AMP;T, Time Warner, and  
other companies to sell them access to cable customers at wholesale 
prices, so competition in the Internet business remains healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, people like the Internet because it's full of  
choices. What AT&AMP;T is saying is, if you want a faster Internet, you 
lose all your choices. And I think people will care a lot about 
that,'' said Greg Simon, co-director of openNET, a lobbying group 
AOL formed with other Internet providers and regional phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest between these two sides will help determine who  
profits the most from the billions of dollars in new subscriber 
fees, online commerce and advertising that will come with this next 
generation of Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is now being played out at the national and local  
levels -- from Congress to municipal cable regulators. On Monday, 
San Francisco's city supervisors will take up the issue and Los 
Angeles is also considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies want to keep their wires to themselves, saying  
there will be a variety of alternative methods that rivals can use 
to deliver high-speed communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital subscriber line, for instance, is a fledgling  
technology that works through ordinary copper telephone lines. In a 
few years, satellite TV services like DirecTV will offer Internet 
and phone hookups. Other wireless systems that beam signals between 
earthbound towers, dishes and cell phones are also in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	While none of these technologies is as fully developed as cable,  
AT&AMP;T argues that it is making major investments in upgrading cable 
systems and should be allowed to profit from this work without 
others horning in. 
</P>
<P>
	``What AOL is suggesting is that it can sit on the sidelines and  
let someone else spend hundreds of billions of dollars and then 
reap the gains with no investment cost,'' said AT&AMP;T general counsel 
Jim Cicconi. ``Our response is if AOL wants a cable network, it can 
go invest in one itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers (ISPs) that use dial-up modems stand  
to lose big money as computer users switch to high-speed systems, 
which the industry classifies under the umbrella term 
``broadband.'' Some smaller providers fear the change could put 
them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL and other ISPs like Prodigy and Mindspring also argue that  
if they are denied access to a broadband connection, it will cost 
their customers plenty. One scenario: AOL members who now pay 
roughly $20 a month will face an additional bill of $40 or $50 to 
AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently AOL dominates the Internet access market with about 17  
million subscribers. AT&AMP;T has so far attracted only about 1.5 
million, according to a report by Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	But, AT&AMP;T's purchase of cable companies Tele-Communications Inc.  
and MediaOne Group, along with related deals, will allow it to 
offer bundles of Internet, phone and cable service to 25.5 million 
homes, about one-quarter of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Forrester study predicts that over the next  
four years, AOL's market share will drop from 44 percent of U.S. 
Internet users to 36 percent as more customers move to broadband. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risk is pretty huge. AOL and the other ISPs need a  
broadband play,'' said Sajai Krishnan, an analyst with Booz Allen 
and Hamilton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fallback position, AOL has cut deals with other companies  
to offer high-speed service within two to three years, using 
digital subscriber lines and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission has so far declined to  
regulate Internet access. While Congressional committees are 
debating it, the fight for cable wires is being waged before local 
governments, which have leverage over cable franchise agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla., have voted to  
force open AT&AMP;T's cable lines. The Portland ordinance was upheld by 
a federal judge and AT&AMP;T has appealed. This past week FCC chairman 
William Kennard announced it will file a legal brief supporting 
AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	OpenNET and AT&AMP;T have mounted intense lobbying campaigns,  
creating slick Web sites and buying full-age newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, city Supervisor Tom Ammiano supports open  
access, but has been bombarded by people trying to change his view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do get orchestrated e-mails from all over the country.  
They're very similar in verbiage telling me why AT&AMP;T is God's gift 
to the millennium,'' said Ammiano. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if AOL fails to win access to cable systems, its existence  
won't be threatened. But its dominance of the industry may be, said 
Bruce Kasrel, an analyst with Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes a threat to their ability to drive the industry if  
they're not a cable broadband player and cable takes off,'' he 
said. ``Broadband is going to begin to really define the Internet 
experience over the next few years.''

<HEADLINE> GM Offers Buyouts to Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Under pressure to cut costs, General Motors Corp.  
has offered thousands of salaried workers buyouts or early 
retirement plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates on the number of offers range from about 3,000 to  
8,000, the Detroit Free Press reported Saturday. GM won't say 
exactly how many letters are going out or what percentage of the 
voluntary plans it expects will be accepted. The company has about 
48,000 U.S. salaried workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been targeted by Wall Street analysts who say it  
has too much overhead in comparison with other automakers. Ford 
Motor Co. offered buyouts to an estimated 2,000 or more salaried 
employees last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has reduced its salaried ranks in the United States over the  
last couple of years, from about 49,720 at the end of 1997 to just 
fewer than 49,000 at the end of '98, according to spokeswoman 
Charlotte Grim. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has about 148,000 hourly workers in the United States, down  
from about 160,000 at the end of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Free Press said buyouts began in April, and most if not all  
the recipients are thought to be 50 or older. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing an unnamed employee, the newspaper said a 58-year-old  
employee is offered 74 percent of his or her salary per month until 
age 62. At that point, the monthly amount would go down to reflect 
monthly payments from Social Security. So the employee would get 
most of what he or she would have received if retiring at age 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyout offers for younger GM employees are less generous,  
granting about 15 months of pay, plus job placement counseling. 
They also would have a retirement benefit they could start 
collecting at age 62, the Free Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The company would not give details of the offers or reveal what  
percentage were buyout packages versus early retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	An investment analyst seemed generally pleased with the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's something companies do every now and then to try to  
reduce costs,'' said Jim Hall, in the Southfield office of 
California-based AutoPacific Inc. ``And it's tough to always ask 
the hourly ranks to lower their head count if you're not doing 
anything on the salaried level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contract talks with the United Auto Workers started last month.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump More Than 5 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices jumped about 5 cents in  
the past two weeks, spurred by higher crude oil prices and 
increased demand caused by recovering world economies, according to 
an industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average on Friday, including all grades  
and taxes, was $1.2671, up 5.18 cents from the previous survey 
conducted July 9, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the highest price in more than 18 months and the biggest  
hike nationally since late March, Ms. Lundberg said Sunday. This 
comes after prices dropped significantly between early May and 
early June. 
</P>
<P>
	Pump prices are high compared to last year, but are comparable  
with prices in 1996 and 1997 during the same period, Ms. Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She blamed the price hikes on production cuts by the  
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as 
recovering Asian and Latin American economies that now require more 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globally, there's just a tighter balance between supply and  
demand,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pump prices were rising throughout the country but were most  
dramatic in the West, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded was  
$1.2108, mid-grade was $1.3107 and premium was $1.3956. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, regular was $1.5449, mid-grade averaged  
$1.6330 and premium $1.7071.

<HEADLINE> Folk Artist by Day, Janitor by Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLYOKE, Mass. (AP) -- Summer mornings find Jamaican folk artist  
Elton Braithwaite in the college classroom teaching youngsters a 
little bit about wood carving and a lot more about life. 
</P>
<P>
	Nights, he's back in the classroom -- pushing a broom.  
</P>
<P>
	The college president calls him a treasure.  
</P>
<P>
	The head of the maintenance staff does, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever I'm doing, I'm just Elton,'' said Braithwaite, who  
has carved a unique niche for himself at Holyoke Community College 
as both an artist and a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
	He has no time for those who wonder what lessons a man who works  
at a menial job can offer at a place of higher learning. 
</P>
<P>
	Or for those who would question why a man whose wood sculptures  
have been displayed in art museums, and which two years ago were 
chosen by the Jaimaican government to represent its wood carving 
traditions in an international tour, should spend his nights 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he was on Earth, Christ was a carpenter,'' Braithwaite  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be unusual, but he is a gifted artist and just does  
terrific work,'' said college President David Bartley. ``He is a 
treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he can't resist adding that if only Braithwaite would  
work on his academic credentials he could be teaching art in more 
than the college's summer program for children. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered it once, said Braithwaite, whose diploma from the  
Jamaica School of Art hangs in his Granby studio and who gives 
programs at schools under the sponsorship of the Massachusetts 
Cultural Council. ``But they wanted me to take over courses that I 
had already taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braithwaite's journey began at age 15 in his native Jamaica,  
when the youngest of 12 children found a screwdriver in the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought it home and sharpened it into a chisel,'' he  
recalled. And for the first time he looked at a block of wood and 
saw the image of a face waiting to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, as his work has become recognized, Braithwaite  
has traveled to Ghana and other African countries to meet other 
woodcarvers. He eventually made his own way to Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mother Nature is the greatest artist; I just shape what she  
creates. The stories are in the wood,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Protests by Banned China Group Wane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Protests by an outlawed meditation group waned  
under a Chinese government crackdown that continued with more 
arrests Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen protesters from the group, Falun Gong, were held  
at a park across the street from the Zhongnanhai compound in 
Beijing, where President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders 
live. An empty city bus and police vans were parked nearby, 
possibly to carry away more detainees. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police patrolled outside the compound but no longer  
stopped pedestrians from walking past it. Police numbers were 
smaller than earlier in the week, when up to 30,000 protesters 
gathered in Beijing and other cities. Thousands of people were 
detained at the quiet, peaceful protests. 
</P>
<P>
	China's communist leaders banned Falun Gong on Thursday, saying  
it ``tried to develop political power.'' Protests had erupted late 
Tuesday after authorities reportedly arrested up to 70 leading sect 
members throughout China. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong leaders have denied any political ambitions and say  
they didn't organize the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash with authorities began April 25, when at least 10,000  
believers surrounded Zhongnanhai in a silent protest of what they 
said was official harassment. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Protests by Banned China Group Wane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Protests by an outlawed meditation group waned  
under a Chinese government crackdown that continued with more 
arrests Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen protesters from the group, Falun Gong, were held  
at a park across the street from the Zhongnanhai compound in 
Beijing, where President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders 
live. An empty city bus and police vans were parked nearby, 
possibly to carry away more detainees. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of police patrolled outside the compound but no longer  
stopped pedestrians from walking past it. Police numbers were 
smaller than earlier in the week, when up to 30,000 protesters 
gathered in Beijing and other cities. Thousands of people were 
detained at the quiet, peaceful protests. 
</P>
<P>
	China's communist leaders banned Falun Gong on Thursday, saying  
it ``tried to develop political power.'' Protests had erupted late 
Tuesday after authorities reportedly arrested up to 70 leading sect 
members throughout China. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong leaders have denied any political ambitions and say  
they didn't organize the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash with authorities began April 25, when at least 10,000  
believers surrounded Zhongnanhai in a silent protest of what they 
said was official harassment.

<HEADLINE> End of Kennedy Search Was a Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Hall had just fallen asleep early  
Wednesday when the telephone rang in his hotel room in Falmouth, 
Mass. Shaking off fatigue from the four-day search for John F. 
Kennedy Jr. and two others, he picked up the receiver and heard the 
voice of his chief crash investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've found a big piece of the airplane,'' Robert Pearce  
told the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
Pearce had just been called on a secure phone line from the USS 
Grasp, which made the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the beginning of the end of a high-pressure search for  
Kennedy, the son of the nation's 35th president, his wife, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette. All three were 
aboard Kennedy's red-and-white Piper Saratoga when it plunged into 
the waters southwest of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., about 9:40 p.m. 
on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The end came five days later, when divers unstrapped Kennedy and  
the sisters from their seats in the plane, put the bodies in body 
bags and brought them to the surface. The remains were then placed 
in aluminum transfer cases, which have the crisp look of military 
caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and his two sons escorted all  
three to land. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted those kids to come home with some dignity,'' said one  
person closely involved in the recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on interviews with Hall and other government officials,  
The Associated Press has been able to reconstruct the conclusion of 
a search that transfixed two families, and much of America. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy took off in his single-engine airplane from Fairfield,  
N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on July 16. He intended to fly to Martha's 
Vineyard to drop off his 34-year-old sister-in-law to visit 
friends. Kennedy, 38, and his wife, 33, were then to fly on to 
Hyannis, Mass., where they were to be guests the next day at the 
wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy, the youngest child of the late 
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	One hour and two minutes into the flight, the airplane went into  
a dive, slipped beneath radar coverage and crashed into the sea 
about 7 1/2 miles off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy won his pilot's license little more than a year earlier.  
He was not rated to fly just with instruments. Veteran pilots and 
flight instructors speculate that he may have become disoriented 
flying in the dark and the haze. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration went to work. It collected  
radar readouts from throughout the region and sent the printouts 
and computer tapes to the safety board. In Washington, analysts fed 
the data into computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates about where the plane crashed were relayed to ships  
and planes operated by Coast Guard, Air National Guard, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Civil Air Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	At 9:45 p.m. on July 18, however, the head of the search and  
rescue effort, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, told a 
news conference that there was no hope of survivors. He said the 
would-be rescuers would now support the safety board with wreckage 
recovery and its accident investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did everything we possibly could to find survivors,''  
Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working through the night on Monday, NTSB performance analyst  
Dan Bowers and aeronautical engineer John Clark narrowed the search 
area to a projected ``splash point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Tuesday morning I was optimistic,'' said Hall. ``I thought  
that day was going to be the day we recovered the wreckage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy laid a grid over Bowers and Clark's splash point. Three  
sonar-equipped ships started a crisscross pattern, coming up with 
10 targets on the ocean floor. With a remote-controlled camera, the 
Navy checked the sites one by one. The first five were not airplane 
wreckage; one particularly promising piece turned out to be an 
anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dejection.  
</P>
<P>
	``At that point, you knew about the anxiety of the families and,  
of course, the many, many people around the world who were paying 
attention to this,'' Hall recalled. ``You always know there is a 
possibility that you can do all of this and not be able to find the 
wreckage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, Hall watched the 11 o'clock news and then went to  
bed. About 11:40 p.m., a submersible from the Grasp came across the 
plane's wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief investigator Pearce was at the Coast Guard command center  
at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. He had been sleeping there each 
night. Suddenly, his phone jingled with the news from the Grasp. He 
called Hall shortly after midnight, and notifications continued up 
and down the line -- including to the Kennedy and Bessette families. 
</P>
<P>
	The success, however, was incomplete. While Kennedy's body was  
plainly visible, the remote TV camera could not locate the sisters. 
Divers would have to finish the search. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	When Kennedy's plane went missing, the news reverberated through  
the nation and the government. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, the  
presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains, was told upon 
awakening. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, married to another of 
Robert Kennedy's daughters, pleaded to his colleagues that the 
government not appear to overreact. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the secretary of transportation, the head of the  
Coast Guard and the chief of the Federal Aviation Administration 
were kept abreast of the search. 
</P>
<P>
	All denied that a celebrity like Kennedy was getting special  
treatment, but Clinton said at a news conference on Wednesday the 
family had sustained ``enormous losses'' on behalf of the country 
and he agreed to give extra time to complete the search. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the news media at a distance, the FAA instituted  
unprecedented airspace restrictions around the search area. Once 
the wreckage was discovered and the bodies located, the 
restrictions were increased to keep any aircraft at least five 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA found that some pilots promptly violated the  
restrictions by turning off equipment relaying their aircraft's 
identification information to air traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall recalled seeing such a swarm of reporters only once before:  
the July 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800. By coincidence, Hall and his 
top assistants were on Long Island when Kennedy crashed for a 
Flight 800 memorial service, monument dedication and investigation 
update. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing made Hall and Larrabee especially concerned about the  
Kennedy and Bessette families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is extremely important to the American system that  
we all enjoy, and it's extremely important that the media have 
information,'' Hall said. ``But when the media causes pain and 
suffering on families at a time of grief, that kind of behavior 
should not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 10:40 a.m. Wednesday, the Grasp was able to send down two  
divers. Arriving at the wreckage site some 116 feet under the 
surface, they were quickly able to locate the Bessette sisters amid 
the twisted metal. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery of the bodies wouldn't come until the afternoon,  
after the arrival of Kennedy and his sons Edward Jr. and Patrick, a 
congressman from Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking hours later at a news conference, Larrabee lamented  
that what started as a search and rescue mission early on July 18 
ended Wednesday with a confirmation of death. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think today,'' Larrabee said, looking into the glare of  
television cameras, ``that we were able to bring closure to two 
families, and I think that we realize is very important, and so I 
think this evening we can feel relatively good about our work.''

<HEADLINE> Woodstock '99 Winding Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Hot, sunburned and exhausted, Woodstock '99  
concertgoers faced the ultimate rock 'n' roll letdown Sunday -- the 
end of the three-day festival and the long ride home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have got to work in the morning,'' said Mara Kugler of  
Baldwin, N.Y., a sleeping bag tucked under her arm. ``It's been a 
long week, but worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many campers were already pulling up stakes and stashing gear in  
their cars Sunday morning in hopes of making a quick getaway once 
their favorite band finished up, but it didn't look promising. 
State police said that by late afternoon more than 70,000 people 
had departed with few delays. The exodus was expected to take up to 
a day since more than 225,000 packed the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like, you know, what your image of hell would be,'' said  
Diana Perchekly, who faced a five-hour drive back to her Long 
Island home. ``This is it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the site indeed was hell for some -- the 3,000-acre former Air  
Force base was littered with flattened fast-food containers, beer 
cans, paper and plastic cups and myriad pizza boxes -- it remained 
heaven for others. 
</P>
<P>
	Slightly over 100 people decided early Sunday that stripping was  
better than grabbing an extra hour or two of sleep and turned out 
for a massive nude photo shoot as a brilliant orange sun began to 
light up the sky. Flyers announcing the escapade were circulated 
over the weekend by photographer Spencer Tunick, who is well known 
for his photos of nudes in public places. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to see the expressions that the photos could bring  
for decades to come,'' said Sarah Warner of Allston, Mass. 
``Picture your kid going, 'Grandma, was that you? You were hot!''' 
</P>
<P>
	King Rex and Queen Cassie, two nudists from Massachusetts,  
arrived at the site ready for the job. King Rex, 45, wore a Panama 
hat, sneakers and Mardi Gras beads. Queen Cassie had a lei around 
her neck and sandals on her feet, and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been nude all weekend. We drove here nude, most of the  
way,'' Rex said. ``This is a natural state for us. I'm glad to see 
that people aren't so hung up that they can't join us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day, as we were putting up our tents, we could hear  
the giggles,'' said Queen Cassie, 50. ``People were peeking out 
from behind their tents to take pictures. They seemed shocked. 
After three days, they don't even give us a second look. In fact, 
half of them are naked now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festival wasn't all peace and love. Things turned somewhat  
ugly in the mosh pit Saturday night while Limp Bizkit was playing. 
A mob of more than 200 threw bottles, smashed a barricade and 
nearly trampled sound system components. One woman suffered a 
serious head cut from a thrown bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Away from the two mammoth stages, a man carrying $16,000 in cash  
was arrested Saturday in the campground for selling mushrooms, 
state trooper Jim Simpson said. The arrest was one of 31 made at 
the festival, troopers said.

<HEADLINE> Andy Dick Worries About His Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Dick is finally starting to worry about his  
image. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor-comedian has been in drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation  
twice and is still awaiting judgment for a drunken driving arrest 
that came after he hit a tree and tried to flee on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Sober again, Dick frets that his reputation could hurt his  
latest movie, the Disney film ``Inspector Gadget,'' at the box 
office if he spreads the word that he's in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I tell them, maybe they're going to grab their kids and go  
running from the theater, screaming, covering their eyes,'' Dick 
says in the Aug. 2 issue of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all kinds of addictions, and I've got every single  
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick, 33, best-known for his work on ``NewsRadio,'' will appear  
this fall in the new animated show, ``Sammy,'' and has a part in 
``Picking Up the Pieces'' with Woody Allen and Sharon Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	He also hopes to stage a one-man show in New York about his  
addictions, but fears that once again his image will work against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to do anything crazy,'' he said, ``because people  
now just shake their heads and feel sorry for me.''

<HEADLINE> Twins Make Movie About Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Filmmaking brothers Michael and Mark Polish  
explored familiar ground in ``Twin Falls Idaho,'' a quirky tale 
about the everyday lives of Siamese twins. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not joined at the hip like the fictional Falls brothers,  
but they are identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers star in the independent film which they co-wrote  
and Michael directed, using a lifetime of experience with the issue 
for reference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big moment for people after they've known us for a  
while,'' Michael says in Sunday's The New York Times, ``when they 
come up and say they can tell us apart. I always find that 
hilarious. Like being identical wasn't good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like we were trying to be identical, and we could only pull it  
off for so long,'' Mark adds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old brothers never had any trouble differentiating  
their respective personalities, noting early on in school that 
Michael had a firmly realistic artistic bent, while Mark's was 
highly expressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see that as more of an acting thing and his as more  
of a directing thing,'' Mark said, waiting in vain for his brother 
to finish the thought before concluding: ``What a perfect person 
we'd be if we were one.''

<HEADLINE> Emergencies Are Common Budget Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, House Republicans declared next year's  
census an emergency. Never mind that the Constitution has required 
the national head count every decade for the past two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	This week they plan to do the same with veterans' health care --  
even though it is little surprise that many of the nation's 26 
million veterans periodically require medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress hits crunch time, these are just two gimmicks  
Republicans are using to spend billions of dollars beyond budget 
spending limits while asserting they remain as fiscally 
conservative as ever. Despite big federal surpluses, the spending 
limits are forcing lawmakers to be frugal, or at least appear to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	Under budget law, declaring an item an emergency means spending  
limits can be ignored and projected surpluses can be spent. That is 
what Republicans are doing amid the political reality that they 
lack the votes to pass spending measures without the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do what you have to do,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio,  
a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, which is 
churning out the 13 annual bills for the fiscal year that starts 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are not the only ones to resort to sleight-of-hand,  
an age-old feature of the annual budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, President Clinton proposed spending $30  
billion above budget limits while claiming he was heeding them. He 
proposed to pay for the extra spending with tax increases on 
cigarettes and other items -- ideas with virtually no chance of 
passing a Republican-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing the same sort of budget tricks with a surplus  
they used to do with deficits,'' said Peter Sperry, who follows the 
federal budget for the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the House GOP's embrace of emergency spending comes  
after many Republicans accused Clinton and their own leaders of 
using the designation to stuff unneeded expenditures into a big 
disaster bill this spring and an omnibus spending measure last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings on paper that Republicans are creating by using  
budget contrivances are beginning to add up. 
</P>
<P>
	Declaring the 2000 census an emergency gets them $4.5 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides say when a subcommittee of the House Appropriations  
Committee votes Monday on a bill for veterans and other programs, 
lawmakers plan to designate an emergency for billions more in 
veterans' health care and disaster relief spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling disaster relief an emergency is not an original GOP  
idea. Clinton proposed the same thing in his budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also may claim another $3 billion in savings in that  
same bill by lowering the Tennessee Valley Authority's borrowing 
authority. Barring the unforeseen, TVA was not planning on the 
additional borrowing anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	In several instances this year, Republicans also have found  
money by ordering Congress' accountants to use more generous 
savings estimates than they had planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Appropriations Committee say House GOP leaders  
told them to use the savings techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., said leaders have two main goals: getting the spending 
bills to the House floor, and not spending the portion of the 
surplus that comes from Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of the process,'' Feehery said.  
</P>
<P>
	But it is unclear how smoothly the process will go.  
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Republicans may oppose some gimmicks, especially if  
they feel the emergency declarations have gone too far. With the 
slim GOP House margin, that could force leaders to find savings 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, analysts say Republicans probably won't pay  
politically for their budget games. The sound economy and summer 
distractions have few Americans paying attention to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the biggest problem is getting anybody in the  
nation to focus on the budget and Washington,'' said Heritage's 
Sperry.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The United States got its gold  
medals, took its bows and said to each other: ``See you in 
Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the gold medal game of the Tournament of  
the Americas on Sunday night, withstanding a mild push from Canada 
early in the second half and going on to an easy 92-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can go home,'' guard Steve Smith said. ``If we hadn't  
qualified, we wouldn't have been able to go back to the United

</P>
<P>
	It was the 40th victory without a loss for the four Dream Teams

average of 31.6 points, down slightly from the 1996 Olympians' 
average margin of 32.3. 
</P>
<P>
	This, however, was the best defensive team of the bunch,  
limiting opponents to 66.2 points per game -- more than four points 
lower than the 1996 team's 70.3 points-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was defense that turned the gold medal game.  
</P>
<P>
	Things were a little too close for the Americans early in the  
second half as Canada pulled within 48-40. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States quickly ended any thought of an upset, using a  
trapping, gambling defense to intercept several passes that led to 
eight fast-break points in a 15-0 run that put the Americans back 
in complete control. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton had seven points in the pivotal run and finished  
with 19, giving him a team-leading average of 16.0 points in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alley-oop dunks don't win games. What won these games for us  
was defense -- we got steals and easy baskets,'' Payton said. ``We 
were out here to shut people down, and that's what we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hardaway added 14 points, Tim Duncan had 12, Steve Smith 11  
and Jason Kidd, Tom Gugliotta and Kevin Garnett 10 apiece. Kidd and 
Payton each had three of the Americans' 11 steals and Garnett had 
six blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to understand,'' said Garnett, who took a bow from  
the podium while accepting his gold medal, ``that we've got a lot 
of defensive players on this team -- Gary Payton, Jason Kidd, Tim 
Duncan. We had a lot of instant offense, but we were able to trap 
and do things defensively that the Dream Teams before us didn't 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the bronze medal game, Argentina edged Puerto Rico 103-101.  
</P>
<P>
	Like most of their games over the past two weeks, the Americans  
played confidently at all times and aggressively when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	They never trailed Canada, opening their first 10-point lead  
just over five minutes into the game, going on cruise control for 
the rest of the first half and turning up their energy when they 
needed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-0 run gave the United States a 63-40 lead, and the margin  
grew to 28 on a 3-pointer by Hardaway that made it 83-55 with 3:56 
left. Smith scored the final points of the tournament on a 15-foot 
hook shot with 1 second left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came to try to play well, play together and play the right  
way, and I think the team did that every single night,'' coach 
Larry Brown said. ``It wasn't an easy format, and I think we're all 
very pleased with the outcome and anxious to go on to Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the few sore spots Sunday for the Americans were the  
non-appearance of Richard Hamilton, who sat out the entire 
tournament after spraining his ankle in the team's first practice 
in Puerto Rico, the second technical foul for Payton, who threw the 
ball at one of the referees following an out-of-bounds call, and 
the bloodying of Tom Gugliotta's nose after he was inadvertently 
elbowed by teammate Wally Szczerbiak late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	For Canada, the lone bright spot Sunday was the play of center  
Todd MacCulloch, a second-round draft pick of the Philadelphia 
76ers who had game-high totals of 22 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's making me look like a genius,'' said 76ers general  
manager Billy King, a member of the USA Basketball selection 
committee. Steve Nash of the Dallas Mavericks was held to 11 points 
and one assist. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Canada qualified for the 2000 Olympics  
with semifinal victories Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Argentina 103, Puerto Rico 101    	
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Ginobili scored 25 points off the bench and Hugo  
Sconochini added 24 for Argentina, offsetting a productive night 
from Jose Ortiz in his final international game for the host team. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz, who played briefly in the NBA for the Utah Jazz, had 24  
points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals and two blocks. But 
it wasn't enough to prevent Puerto Rico from losing its third game 
in as many nights -- a big disappointment given the team's bold 
predictions going into its final second-round game against the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina led for almost the entire second half and took a  
three-point lead on two foul shots by Ginobili with 17 seconds 
left. Orlando Santiago made one of two foul shots with two seconds 
left, missing the second intentionally. After a scramble for the 
ball, Orlando Vega made a jump shot for Puerto Rico that came after 
the final buzzer 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams shot well from the field, Argentina hitting 54  
percent and Puerto Rico 59 percent. Andres Nocioni added 13 points 
off the bench, and Juan Espil and Luis Scola added 12 apiece for 
Argentina, which did not qualify for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> 'Quiet' Kennedy Has Leadership Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- In a family known for glamour, adventure  
and, sometimes, calamitous misadventure, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend 
is often called the good Kennedy, the quiet Kennedy, clean Kathleen 
-- and only partly in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two decades, while more famous relatives moved in  
Washington's power corridors and otherwise made headlines, the 
first child of Robert Kennedy built a career in public service; 
raised four daughters, ages 7 to 21, with her college professor 
husband; and, as the eldest of 30 Kennedy cousins, rallied the 
family in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after five years as Maryland's lieutenant governor, Ms.  
Townsend is in position to step forward as the political 
standard-bearer for her generation of Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	The family patriarch, of course, remains U.S. Sen. Edward  
Kennedy. His son, Patrick, a congressman from Rhode Island, has 
proven himself a skilled fund-raiser and heads the House campaign 
committee that helps elects Democrats. Ms. Townsend's younger 
brother, Joseph, left Congress last year after six terms, but 
speculation has him re-entering politics in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, though, is already considered the frontrunner for  
Maryland governor in the 2002 election, and her name has also 
surfaced -- among many others -- as a possible vice presidential 
running mate for Democrat Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other Kennedy of her generation in elected office is  
cousin Mark Shriver, a Maryland state lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, 48, has the characteristic toothy Kennedy smile  
but has had to work hard to pick up the political skills her father 
and uncles exhibited so effortlessly. One family trait she never 
lacked, however, is the competitive Kennedy spirit, especially in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Joseph Tydings, a close friend of Robert Kennedy,  
remembers a touch football game when Kathleen was 10 or 11. She and 
her father went up against Tydings and another man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they beat us or not, but if they didn't, it  
was damned close,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From an early age, Ms. Townsend was expected to shoulder some  
responsibility for her 10 siblings and many cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most cherished possessions -- framed and hanging in a  
hallway of her Victorian home in suburban Baltimore -- is this 
letter Robert Kennedy wrote to his 12-year-old daughter the day 
President John F. Kennedy was buried: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Kathleen. You seem to understand that Jack died and was  
buried today. As the oldest of the Kennedy grandchildren, you have 
a particular responsibility now -- a special responsibility to John 
and Joe. Be kind to others and work for your country. Love, 
Daddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter referred to her brother Joe and to cousin John  
Kennedy Jr., who had turned 3 that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's son was killed July 17 in a private plane crash  
off Martha's Vineyard. The Townsends accompanied President Clinton 
and his family to New York City for the Kennedy memorial service 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kennedy's trust in his daughter was not misplaced.  
Friends say Ms. Townsend can be counted on in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the lead in defending Joe against criticism he'd tried  
to bully his first wife into an annulment of their 12-year 
marriage, two years after they divorced. In 1979, she went to court 
to become brother David's legal guardian, to try to rescue him from 
drug abuse. He had the guardianship revoked a year later and died 
of an overdose in 1984. Another brother, Michael, was killed in a 
skiing accident Dec. 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, David, said in a 1997 interview with The Boston  
Globe Magazine that Ms. Townsend ``plays an enormous leadership 
role in the family. When something happens, like with one of her 
brothers, she is called immediately; she is the one who makes the 
decision to try to unravel things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Rainie, author of the book, ``Growing Up Kennedy,'' said Ms.  
Townsend leads by example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think she wags her finger at the other cousins,'' he  
said in an interview. ``I don't think she tries to teach them life 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has an internal check on her and an internal compass  
inside her that has kept her from doing the sometimes very wild, 
very reckless, life-threatening things that some of the others have 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend's first run for office, for Congress in 1986, made  
her the first Kennedy to lose an election. 
</P>
<P>
	She picked up the pieces and formed the Maryland Student Service  
Alliance in partnership with the state education department, where 
she developed the nation's only statewide program that requires 
public school students to perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, she joined the U.S. Justice Department as a deputy  
assistant attorney general in charge of community policing 
programs, 
</P>
<P>
	Some might have considered her brief political career long dead,  
but in 1994, Parris Glendening surprised all of Maryland by asking 
her to be his lieutenant governor running mate. They won by fewer 
than 6,000 votes but last year won re-election with a margin of 
almost 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend now ``enjoys extremely strong popularity across the  
state,'' says pollster Keith Haller of Potomac Survey research, but 
even friends say she lacked political polish in her first two 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	When she departed from written remarks, her speeches often  
became disjointed. She gestured awkwardly and distractingly bobbed 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``She isn't loaded with the Kennedy charisma, and she knows  
it,'' Rainie said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 1998 campaign saw a different Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.  
A speaking coach helped improve her delivery. She wore more 
fashionable clothes, changed her hair style and scrapped her 
eyeglasses for contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of her beliefs diverge from liberal Democratic  
positions associated with Kennedys -- she supports the death 
penalty, for example, and opposes parole for violent offenders -- 
she has defended her positions as very much in line with lessons 
learned from her father. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime friend, Democratic political consultant Bob Shrum,  
said positions may differ, ``but if the question is, does she carry 
on the underlying idealism that motivated her father, I think it's 
clear she does.''

<HEADLINE>  Piniella, Segui Ejected From Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Seattle manager Lou Piniella was ejected in  
the fifth inning of Sunday's game at Minnesota for arguing an 
appeal call by third-base umpire Durwood Merril. 
</P>
<P>
	One inning later, Mariners first baseman David Segui was tossed  
by home plate ump Mike Everitt. Segui had been brushed back by 
Twins pitcher Brad Radke before flying out and was ejected for 
yelling at Everitt after returning to the Seattle bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Piniella was tossed after throwing his cap while arguing that  
Raul Ibanez had not left third base early on an apparent sacrifice 
fly by Ken Griffey. 
</P>
<P>
	With Seattle already ahead 4-0, Ibanez appeared to have scored  
from third on Griffey's sacrifice fly. But Minnesota appealed the 
play and Merril made the out call for an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	In his anger, Piniella attempted to lift up third base but  
couldn't, so he kicked dirt on the base instead. When he returned 
to the dugout, he threw several bats onto the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Piniella has been ejected this season. The  
Mariners had lost three straight and 11 of their past 18 entering 
the game.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Wins Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong's smile seemed as wide as the  
Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
	For three weeks, his face had been creased by stress and  
determination. Now, he was grinning giddily, draped in an American 
flag, savoring his victory lap along the majestic avenue where he'd 
just completed one of the most improbable comebacks in sports 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong rode to victory in the Tour de France on Sunday just  
three years after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that 
spread to his brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans lined the route to cheer him as he finished  
one of the most grueling tests in all of sports and became only the 
second American to win cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an awesome day,'' the 27-year-old Texan said. ``This  
is beyond belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong dedicated his victory to cancer survivors around the  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it sends out a fantastic message,'' he said. ``We can  
return to what we were before -- and even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many watching him said that's just the message they got.  
</P>
<P>
	``He definitely embodies the American spirit,'' said Rebecca  
Robertson, a Californian who watched the riders whiz by in their 
fluorescent gear. ``I mean, he's overcome cancer and he's fought 
his way back to be a champion. And that is definitely what America 
is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's victory marked the second time this month that the  
United States won in a sport usually dominated by other countries. 
The U.S. women's soccer team beat China for the World Cup on July 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclist's triumph also could help remove some of the stain  
from the Tour de France, which nearly ended last year because of a 
drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20th and final stage was won by Australia's Robbie McEwen.  
He edged Germany's Erik Zabel in a furious sprint. Silvio 
Martinelli of Italy was third. Armstrong was 86th -- in the 86th 
Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	His final margin in the overall standings was 7 minutes, 37  
seconds, and his lead for the past week had almost assured him 
victory, barring a disastrous fall. Alex Zulle finished second and 
Spain's Fernando Escartin was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the race was Greg LeMond, a  
three-time champion whose last victory was in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996 and doctors gave him  
about a 50 percent chance of survival. After four rounds of 
chemotherapy and two operations -- one to remove a testicle and one 
for brain lesions -- he began his comeback early last year. His 
doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer will return. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to Armstrong's cycling victory was his ability  
to master the mountain climbs that had always given him trouble. 
After he easily won the first stage in the Alps, he became the 
prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said he'd never imagined this moment, even before he  
got sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never expected to be here,'' he said, after ``The  
Star-Spangled Banner'' had echoed across the Champs-Elysees and 
Texas Gov. George Bush called on the cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in my first career, I never had plans for this.''  
</P>
<P>
	The finish under brilliant skies couldn't have been more  
different from last year's. The 1998 race ended in rain after the 
drug scandal placed the entire sport under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Armstrong was dogged by accusations in the French media  
that he used performance-enhancing drugs. Many people couldn't 
believe that a cyclist recovering from cancer could prevail in the 
brutal three-week event. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no proof, however. The sport's ruling body, which  
tests cyclists during the race, said the only drug Armstrong used 
was an approved prescription cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was simply a remarkable example of grit, courage and  
preparation. He'd visited and tested nearly every stage months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see the wonderful image of Lance Armstrong  
pedaling through the Arc de Triomphe,'' said Dr. Lawrence Einhorn, 
who helped remove the cancer from Armstrong at Indiana University 
Medical Center in Indianapolis. ``We take great pride in all of the 
patients that we treat who successfully recover, whether they go 
back to be accountants or lawyers or journalists. This just happens 
to be something on the world stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's triumphant day began with a laugh. On the riders'  
high-speed train to Arpajon, the starting point, Armstrong was 
given a few moments at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello peleton (pack),'' he called out. ``I'm here driving. I'm  
a bit hung over from a couple of beers last night, but everything 
is fine. I'll get us there as fast as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The train arrived early.  
</P>
<P>
	The stage was a fairly easy 89-mile ride from Arpajon up to  
Paris, and then past many of the city's grandest sights: the 
Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens with their giant summer ferris wheel, 
the arcaded Rue de Rivoli, the Place de la Concorde with its 
Egyptian obelisk, and then up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de 
Triomphe for a loop that was repeated 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	French national champion Francois Simon dyed his hair the  
red-white-and-blue of his jersey. And not only was Armstrong clad 
in the yellow shirt of the race's leader, his wheel was yellow, 
too, spokes and all. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Armstrong was to lose that newly decorated wheel to a  
puncture, but his loyal teammates from the U.S. Postal Service 
helped him back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's victory could be a big boost for American cycling,  
much as the success of the U.S. women's soccer team has inspired 
many in the United States. Although LeMond won the race, it was not 
with an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	For the host country, the race was a disaster. For the first  
time since 1926, a French cyclist failed to win a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old U.S. Postal Service team was euphoric throughout  
the race. Early on, team managing director Mark Gorski compared an 
Armstrong victory to a team of French players winning the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's mother, Linda, shaking with emotion, was waving a  
small U.S. flag as she watched her son wave from the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	She called his cancer a ``minor setback,'' and said ``it was  
never in our minds'' that he wouldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong then went into the audience to hug and kiss his wife,  
Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked so hard to get this,'' she said. ``He deserves it,  
every last bit.''

<HEADLINE> Stayner Family Victim of Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MERCED, Calif. (AP) -- The FBI's suspect in the killing of a  
woman at Yosemite National Park has links to a 1970s kidnapping 
that remains one of California's most notorious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Murder suspect Cary Stayner is a brother of Steven Stayner, who  
in 1972 was snatched off a Merced street and remained missing for 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Stayner was reunited with his family in 1980. But as if  
he lived his short life under a cloud, he died in 1989 in a 
collision with a hit-and-run driver at 24. A television miniseries 
later portrayed the saga of his abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if Stayner's life was split in three -- his early years  
growing up in a working-class family of seven, his lost years with 
kidnapper Kenneth Parnell and the time back with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Parnell kept his hold on Stayner by showering him with gifts and  
telling him his parents could no longer afford him. 
</P>
<P>
	Their years together ended when the teen-ager went to police  
with a freshly kidnapped 8-year-old boy. Steven said he didn't want 
the younger boy to suffer the same abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He was initially riddled with guilt about turning in his  
abductor and then angry about his lost family. 
</P>
<P>
	A fitful student, the resurrected Stayner juggled book offers,  
young love and a slew of traffic citations. He married and fathered 
two children before meeting his tragic end while driving a 
motorcycle on a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven's siblings ranged from age 4 to 12 when he was kidnapped  
and lived their own ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Steve came home, everybody else all got shoved in the  
background and here's this hero,'' said his mother, Kay. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Film Takes New Browns To the Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Teaching is Chris Palmer's favorite part of  
being an NFL coach. His first lesson for the new Browns was 
football history -- their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach wants his players to understand and respect the  
franchise's storied past. On Saturday night, during the team's 
first training camp meeting, he showed a film that chronicled more 
than a half-century of Cleveland football memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me chills,'' cornerback Ray Jackson said. ``It was  
great. I had no idea they were the first team to win a Monday night 
game. That got me fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the eight-minute video, ``This Is Cleveland Browns  
Football,'' players watched black-and-white footage of Otto Graham 
throwing pinpoint scoring passes in the 1940s and 50s when Paul 
Brown's teams dominated the All-American Football Conference and 
later the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were awestruck as fullback Marion Motley bulldozed  
tacklers, lost his helmet and went the final 15 yards for a 
touchdown. They saw Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly run around and away 
from defenses in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	There was Brian Sipe leading the '70s Browns in another  
comeback, and Bernie Kosar threading a TD pass to Webster Slaughter 
in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	And they saw the Dawg Pound, Cleveland's rabid end-zone  
contingent of fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty cool,'' center Dave Wohlabaugh said. ``You  
always have an appreciation for the guys who came before you. And 
this gave some of us a better chance to learn about the Browns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the session, rookie Tim Couch turned to fellow  
quarterback Ty Detmer with an important question. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Where's their facemasks at?''' Detmer said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the full roster of 89 players practiced together for  
the first time. And for the first time since camp opened for the 
rookies last Thursday, players were in full pads and hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	As the players walked from the locker room shortly after 8 a.m.,  
they were cheered by nearly 2,000 fans. The loudest ovation was for 
linebacker Chris Spielman, an Ohio football great. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't played a down in the NFL since midway through the 1997  
season when he was sidelined while with Buffalo. He planned to come 
back last year after neck surgery but sat out the season to be with 
his wife as she battled breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Spielman mostly stared at the ground, his face  
intense, as fans barked approval for the four-time Pro Bowl middle 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's humbling,'' Spielman said. ``It's nice. It was kind of  
welcome back home and a welcome back to playing. It's something I'm 
going to remember for a long time. I've never had that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns fans have been hungry for football, and after a  
three-year wait they finally got to see real-live players knock 
each other around. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first thud, that's what Cleveland has been waiting to  
hear,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the afternoon session, Spielman was involved in a violent  
collision with fullback Tarek Saleh. Spielman was slow getting up 
and staggered back to the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did you see it?'' Palmer asked. ``That's what it's all  
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following practice, Spielman walked the length of the practice  
field and hit the blocking sled and tackling dummy several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to put some more air in my helmet and I was just testing  
it out,'' Spielman said. ``A whack like that feels good. I hadn't 
had one of those in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Antonio Langham, selected in the expansion draft, is  
one of three former Browns -- Jerry Ball and Orlando Brown are the 
others -- who is also a member of the new Browns. Langham has been 
in town for months but said it wasn't until Sunday's practice that 
he felt as if he had truly returned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you put the pads on and you see those fans,'' he said.  
``I'm back now. It's Cleveland football again. Your blood starts to 
bleed brown again.''

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Wins Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Lance Armstrong's smile seemed as wide as the  
Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
	For three weeks, his face had been creased by stress and  
determination. Now, he was grinning giddily, draped in an American 
flag, savoring his victory lap along the majestic avenue where he'd 
just completed one of the most improbable comebacks in sports 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong rode to victory in the Tour de France on Sunday just  
three years after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that 
spread to his brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of fans lined the route to cheer him as he finished  
one of the most grueling tests in all of sports and became only the 
second American to win cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an awesome day,'' the 27-year-old Texan said. ``This  
is beyond belief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong dedicated his victory to cancer survivors around the  
world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it sends out a fantastic message,'' he said. ``We can  
return to what we were before -- and even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many watching him said that's just the message they got.  
</P>
<P>
	``He definitely embodies the American spirit,'' said Rebecca  
Robertson, a Californian who watched the riders whiz by in their 
fluorescent gear. ``I mean, he's overcome cancer and he's fought 
his way back to be a champion. And that is definitely what America 
is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's victory marked the second time this month that the  
United States won in a sport usually dominated by other countries. 
The U.S. women's soccer team beat China for the World Cup on July 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclist's triumph also could help remove some of the stain  
from the Tour de France, which nearly ended last year because of a 
drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20th and final stage was won by Australia's Robbie McEwen.  
He edged Germany's Erik Zabel in a furious sprint. Silvio 
Martinelli of Italy was third. Armstrong was 86th -- in the 86th 
Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	His final margin in the overall standings was 7 minutes, 37  
seconds, and his lead for the past week had almost assured him 
victory, barring a disastrous fall. Alex Zulle finished second and 
Spain's Fernando Escartin was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other American to win the race was Greg LeMond, a  
three-time champion whose last victory was in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer in 1996 and doctors gave him  
about a 50 percent chance of survival. After four rounds of 
chemotherapy and two operations -- one to remove a testicle and one 
for brain lesions -- he began his comeback early last year. His 
doctors say there is a tiny chance the cancer will return. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys to Armstrong's cycling victory was his ability  
to master the mountain climbs that had always given him trouble. 
After he easily won the first stage in the Alps, he became the 
prohibitive favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said he'd never imagined this moment, even before he  
got sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never expected to be here,'' he said, after ``The  
Star-Spangled Banner'' had echoed across the Champs-Elysees and 
Texas Gov. George Bush called on the cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in my first career, I never had plans for this.''  
</P>
<P>
	The finish under brilliant skies couldn't have been more  
different from last year's. The 1998 race ended in rain after the 
drug scandal placed the entire sport under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Armstrong was dogged by accusations in the French media  
that he used performance-enhancing drugs. Many people couldn't 
believe that a cyclist recovering from cancer could prevail in the 
brutal three-week event. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no proof, however. The sport's ruling body, which  
tests cyclists during the race, said the only drug Armstrong used 
was an approved prescription cream for saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was simply a remarkable example of grit, courage and  
preparation. He'd visited and tested nearly every stage months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see the wonderful image of Lance Armstrong  
pedaling through the Arc de Triomphe,'' said Dr. Lawrence Einhorn, 
who helped remove the cancer from Armstrong at Indiana University 
Medical Center in Indianapolis. ``We take great pride in all of the 
patients that we treat who successfully recover, whether they go 
back to be accountants or lawyers or journalists. This just happens 
to be something on the world stage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's triumphant day began with a laugh. On the riders'  
high-speed train to Arpajon, the starting point, Armstrong was 
given a few moments at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello peleton (pack),'' he called out. ``I'm here driving. I'm  
a bit hung over from a couple of beers last night, but everything 
is fine. I'll get us there as fast as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The train arrived early.  
</P>
<P>
	The stage was a fairly easy 89-mile ride from Arpajon up to  
Paris, and then past many of the city's grandest sights: the 
Louvre, the Tuileries Gardens with their giant summer ferris wheel, 
the arcaded Rue de Rivoli, the Place de la Concorde with its 
Egyptian obelisk, and then up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc de 
Triomphe for a loop that was repeated 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	French national champion Francois Simon dyed his hair the  
red-white-and-blue of his jersey. And not only was Armstrong clad 
in the yellow shirt of the race's leader, his wheel was yellow, 
too, spokes and all. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Armstrong was to lose that newly decorated wheel to a  
puncture, but his loyal teammates from the U.S. Postal Service 
helped him back to the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's victory could be a big boost for American cycling,  
much as the success of the U.S. women's soccer team has inspired 
many in the United States. Although LeMond won the race, it was not 
with an American team. 
</P>
<P>
	For the host country, the race was a disaster. For the first  
time since 1926, a French cyclist failed to win a stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old U.S. Postal Service team was euphoric throughout  
the race. Early on, team managing director Mark Gorski compared an 
Armstrong victory to a team of French players winning the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's mother, Linda, shaking with emotion, was waving a  
small U.S. flag as she watched her son wave from the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	She called his cancer a ``minor setback,'' and said ``it was  
never in our minds'' that he wouldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong then went into the audience to hug and kiss his wife,  
Kristin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked so hard to get this,'' she said. ``He deserves it,  
every last bit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Roy Lassiter and Cary Talley scored to  
give depleted DC United a 2-0 victory Sunday over the New England 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory improves the Eastern Conference-leading United to  
13-7, seven points ahead of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	DC, missing seven starters due to international duty or injury,  
opened the scoring in the 11th minute through Lassiter, who headed 
in a short lob by Clint Peay on the left side, beating Walter Zenga 
from nine yards along the left post. Lassiter, MLS's leading 
goalscorer, now has 15 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	United added to its lead in the 33rd minute when Talley scored  
off an Antonio Otero corner kick on the left side as he headed the 
ball just inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	New England (8-10) didn't get its first shot until the 50th  
minute when Jamar Beasley was denied by Tom Prestus, who made a 
stop going low to his right to snuff Beasley's bid from 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The match marked the league debut for 20-year-old United  
midfielder Chris Albright, who turned in a strong performance over 
his 77-minute debut.

<HEADLINE> Old Woman Crashes Car Into Eatery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSLOW, Maine (AP) -- An elderly woman having problems pulling  
out of a handicapped parking space accidentally crashed her car 
into a restaurant on Sunday, injuring 27 people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve people were taken by ambulance to area hospitals, some  
with serious injuries. Police said the injuries were not considered 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people were treated at the scene for cuts and bruises.  
</P>
<P>
	Marie Wyman, 87, was having problems pulling out of a  
handicapped parking spot when her car lurched forward into the 
Lobster Trap and Steakhouse at about 1:10 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buick sedan went through the restaurant foyer and into the  
dining room, throwing tables, chairs and people aside. The car 
struck the opposite wall, breaking a plate-glass window, then 
backed up about 25 feet and hit another wall before coming to a 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the outside it didn't look real bad, but inside the  
restaurant it was a total disaster,'' said Fire Chief William Page. 
</P>
<P>
	Winslow is about 20 miles north of Augusta.

<HEADLINE> Western Wildfires Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Firefighters kept watch for rattlesnakes  
Sunday as they battled a pair of fires that had burned more than 
30,000 acres near Reno and a Navy bombing range to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 firefighters had completely surrounded a 15,500-acre  
wildfire in the steep canyons about 8 miles east of Reno, and the 
columns of smoke that were visible from the city had started to 
dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews also had mostly contained the 15,500-acre fire southeast  
of Fallon that was started on the Fallon Naval Air Station by 
bomber training on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A third fire that had blackened more than 32,000 acres of  
rangeland in the sparsely settled northeast corner of the state was 
fully contained Sunday, eight days after it was started by 
lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of northern Nevada is very, very dry,'' Forest Service  
spokeswoman Sharon Sweeney said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno fire had burned quickly through thick stands of highly  
flammable grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Hand crews had to be used because steep terrain made it  
impossible to get bulldozers and other heavy equipment near the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rattlesnakes have been seen along the fire line and in the  
vicinity of the fire,'' Forest Service spokeswoman Jocelyn Biro 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters lit a series of back fires early Sunday to help cut  
off the primary flames and by midday the fire was 85 percent 
contained by fire breaks. Biro said they hoped to have it 
extinguished by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reno and Fallon fires were both caused by humans and  
investigators were attempting to learn if they might have been set 
deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the West, a week-old fire in California's Santa  
Barbara County had burned 14,200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a second fire in the San Bernardino National Forest  
forced the evacuation of several homes and stables as flames 
blackened 600 acres of desert and mountain brush. One outbuilding 
was destroyed but no homes were damaged and no injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	That blaze, located about 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles in  
San Bernardino County, began around 12:45 p.m. Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Why Are Prairie Chickens Dying? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLCOMB, Kan. (AP) -- They are known affectionately as the  
``Chicken Boys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their mission is to find out why the population of lesser  
prairie chickens is declining on the grasslands of southwest 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although their nickname and the subject of their study might  
sound humorous, diminishing numbers of the bird may be a warning 
that its habitat is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the canary in the mine. If we lose the prairie chicken,  
it's an indication that the prairie isn't healthy,'' said Brent 
Jamison, one of three researchers conducting a study sponsored by 
Kansas State University and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there are no exact figures on the number of lesser  
prairie chickens in Kansas, surveys show the population has 
declined since the 1960s throughout its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesser prairie chicken, which actually is a small grouse  
with brown and white stripes, lives in Colorado, Kansas, New 
Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. Kansas and Texas still have hunting 
seasons for the bird, but the other three states have closed their 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three years, researchers have been studying the  
bird's habitat on 14,400 acres of the Sunflower Electric Power 
Corp.'s plant site in Holcomb. The site includes the sand sagebrush 
prairie that the lesser prairie chicken favors for nesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have trapped 293 birds and have placed radio collars  
on about 160. They now are tracking the movements of 60 birds that 
have been collared this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers point to the conversion of the prairie to  
cropland as the biggest reason for the demise of the lesser prairie 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	This process has occurred largely during the past 50 years,  
Jamison said, and accelerated during the 1960s with the rise of 
center-pivot irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, lesser prairie chickens do not seem to adapt to  
cropland. Of approximately 70 nests found in the Kansas study, only 
one was in a crop field. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet loss of habitat appears to be only one piece of the puzzle.  
</P>
<P>
	Researcher Tom Walker said the bird's numbers have continued to  
decline in recent years despite the fact that grassland no longer 
is being converted to cropland. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor in the decline of the lesser prairie chicken is  
the bird's susceptibility to predators, particularly as chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison said about half of all chicks are eaten by such  
predators as snakes, coyotes, skunks and hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the McDonald's of the prairie. Everything eats them,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overgrazing poses a problem for the bird's habitat in other  
states, Jamison said, but it does not appear to be troublesome in 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers plan to complete their study in August and publish  
their results. A new three-year study scheduled to start next 
spring will seek to develop land management strategies to preserve 
the habitat of the prairie chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, based in Boulder,  
Colo., petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the 
lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. Last year, the 
federal agency made the bird a candidate for future listing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biology tells us that the bird is in serious enough shape  
that it does warrant listing as threatened, but there are more 
species that need help first,'' said Erich Langer, outreach 
coordinator for the agency's field office in Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding a way to keep the bird off the list is one of the goals  
of the Kansas research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new way of dealing with things. What we're trying to do  
is jump in and be proactive,'' said Roger Applegate, who is 
coordinating the studies for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Naming the lesser prairie chicken a threatened species most  
likely would ban hunting of the bird. Colorado, New Mexico and 
Oklahoma already have closed their hunting seasons, and Jamison 
said extending this ban to Kansas would alienate a group of the 
bird's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamison noted that an excise tax on sporting guns and ammunition  
helped pay for the first Kansas study, and Applegate said it also 
will help fund the second study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunting is not the cause of the decline,'' said Curran Salter,  
another researcher working on the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Applegate agreed, noting that Colorado has experienced  
population declines even though it banned hunting of the bird 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Extinction also would be a blow to bird watchers, who enjoy  
observing the lesser prairie chicken's colorful courtship ritual 
each spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The males gather at breeding grounds where they strut and leap  
to gain the attention of prospective mates. The male courtship 
ritual also includes inflating their pink throat sacs and emitting 
loud noises, which explains why breeding areas often are called 
booming grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every spring, people come from all over the world,'' said  
Jasper Carlton, executive director of the Biodiversity Legal 
Foundation. ``What I fear is that they are coming to see the last 
ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal wildlife officials say they are doing  
everything they can to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's field office in Manhattan  
recently received $75,000 to encourage landowners to enter into 
voluntary agreements to help restore the bird's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Gill, field supervisor for the Ecological Services Division  
at the Manhattan office, said many landowners have expressed 
interest in the program, although no agreements have been signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Williams, secretary of the Kansas Department of Wildlife  
and Parks, said he is optimistic about the bird's ability to bounce 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the prospects are good,'' he said. ``The species has a  
lot of attention now. Partnerships are being created between states 
and landowners.''

care if AT&AMP;T and a handful of other giant cable companies dominate 
the high-speed Internet business? 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, which is spending $100 billion this year to become the  
nation's biggest cable TV company, is betting that they won't -- and 
federal antitrust watchdogs have so far kept hands off. 
</P>
<P>
	But America Online and other Internet companies that now reach  
consumers through slow dial-up phone connections see danger in 
creating a new Ma Cable and her sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	They want government regulators to force AT&AMP;T, Time Warner, and  
other companies to sell them access to cable customers at wholesale 
prices, so competition in the Internet business remains healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, people like the Internet because it's full of  
choices. What AT&AMP;T is saying is, if you want a faster Internet, you 
lose all your choices. And I think people will care a lot about 
that,'' said Greg Simon, co-director of openNET, a lobbying group 
AOL formed with other Internet providers and regional phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest between these two sides will help determine who  
profits the most from the billions of dollars in new subscriber 
fees, online commerce and advertising that will come with this next 
generation of Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is now being played out at the national and local  
levels -- from Congress to municipal cable regulators. On Monday, 
San Francisco's city supervisors will take up the issue and Los 
Angeles is also considering it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable companies want to keep their wires to themselves, saying  
there will be a variety of alternative methods that rivals can use 
to deliver high-speed communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The digital subscriber line, for instance, is a fledgling  
technology that works through ordinary copper telephone lines. In a 
few years, satellite TV services like DirecTV will offer Internet 
and phone hookups. Other wireless systems that beam signals between 
earthbound towers, dishes and cell phones are also in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
	While none of these technologies is as fully developed as cable,  
AT&AMP;T argues that it is making major investments in upgrading cable 
systems and should be allowed to profit from this work without 
others horning in. 
</P>
<P>
	``What AOL is suggesting is that it can sit on the sidelines and  
let someone else spend hundreds of billions of dollars and then 
reap the gains with no investment cost,'' said AT&AMP;T general counsel 
Jim Cicconi. ``Our response is if AOL wants a cable network, it can 
go invest in one itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet service providers (ISPs) that use dial-up modems stand  
to lose big money as computer users switch to high-speed systems, 
which the industry classifies under the umbrella term 
``broadband.'' Some smaller providers fear the change could put 
them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL and other ISPs like Prodigy and Mindspring also argue that  
if they are denied access to a broadband connection, it will cost 
their customers plenty. One scenario: AOL members who now pay 
roughly $20 a month will face an additional bill of $40 or $50 to 
AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently AOL dominates the Internet access market with about 17  
million subscribers. AT&AMP;T has so far attracted only about 1.5 
million, according to a report by Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	But, AT&AMP;T's purchase of cable companies Tele-Communications Inc.  
and MediaOne Group, along with related deals, will allow it to 
offer bundles of Internet, phone and cable service to 25.5 million 
homes, about one-quarter of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Forrester study predicts that over the next  
four years, AOL's market share will drop from 44 percent of U.S. 
Internet users to 36 percent as more customers move to broadband. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risk is pretty huge. AOL and the other ISPs need a  
broadband play,'' said Sajai Krishnan, an analyst with Booz Allen 
and Hamilton in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	As a fallback position, AOL has cut deals with other companies  
to offer high-speed service within two to three years, using 
digital subscriber lines and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission has so far declined to  
regulate Internet access. While Congressional committees are 
debating it, the fight for cable wires is being waged before local 
governments, which have leverage over cable franchise agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, Portland, Ore., and Broward County, Fla., have voted to  
force open AT&AMP;T's cable lines. The Portland ordinance was upheld by 
a federal judge and AT&AMP;T has appealed. This past week FCC chairman 
William Kennard announced it will file a legal brief supporting 
AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	OpenNET and AT&AMP;T have mounted intense lobbying campaigns,  
creating slick Web sites and buying full-age newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, city Supervisor Tom Ammiano supports open  
access, but has been bombarded by people trying to change his view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do get orchestrated e-mails from all over the country.  
They're very similar in verbiage telling me why AT&AMP;T is God's gift 
to the millennium,'' said Ammiano. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if AOL fails to win access to cable systems, its existence  
won't be threatened. But its dominance of the industry may be, said 
Bruce Kasrel, an analyst with Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``It becomes a threat to their ability to drive the industry if  
they're not a cable broadband player and cable takes off,'' he 
said. ``Broadband is going to begin to really define the Internet 
experience over the next few years.''

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Mulling Senate Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Is the world ready for Sen. Jerry Springer?  
</P>
<P>
	The TV talk show host said he has spoken with top Democratic  
Party advisers about the possibility of challenging Sen. Mike 
DeWine, R-Ohio, in next year's election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics has always been in my blood, it's always been my  
passion,'' said Springer, a former Cincinnati mayor and 
unsuccessful candidate for the 1982 Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	If he runs for the Senate, he conceded that the sometimes  
violent, ribald ``Jerry Springer Show'' would be an issue that his 
critics could and would use against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you can only talk about the show for so long,'' he said,  
``then we'll have to talk about the issues. People will say, 'How 
does that affect my life? What does he think about health care?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Burke, chairman of the Hamilton County Democratic Party,  
said Springer has a ``remarkable ability to move people through 
public speaking'' much like Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a former 
pro wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	``My show is just a job. I don't take it seriously, but this?  
This is serious,'' Springer said. ``Maybe it's crazy, who knows?''

<HEADLINE> 'Quiet' Kennedy Has Leadership Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- In a family known for glamour, adventure  
and, sometimes, calamitous misadventure, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend 
is often called the good Kennedy, the quiet Kennedy, clean Kathleen 
-- and only partly in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two decades, while more famous relatives moved in  
Washington's power corridors and otherwise made headlines, the 
first child of Robert Kennedy built a career in public service; 
raised four daughters, ages 7 to 21, with her college professor 
husband; and, as the eldest of 30 Kennedy cousins, rallied the 
family in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after five years as Maryland's lieutenant governor, Ms.  
Townsend is in position to step forward as the political 
standard-bearer for her generation of Kennedys. 
</P>
<P>
	The family patriarch, of course, remains U.S. Sen. Edward  
Kennedy. His son, Patrick, a congressman from Rhode Island, has 
proven himself a skilled fund-raiser and heads the House campaign 
committee that helps elects Democrats. Ms. Townsend's younger 
brother, Joseph, left Congress last year after six terms, but 
speculation has him re-entering politics in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, though, is already considered the frontrunner for  
Maryland governor in the 2002 election, and her name has also 
surfaced -- among many others -- as a possible vice presidential 
running mate for Democrat Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other Kennedy of her generation in elected office is  
cousin Mark Shriver, a Maryland state lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend, 48, has the characteristic toothy Kennedy smile  
but has had to work hard to pick up the political skills her father 
and uncles exhibited so effortlessly. One family trait she never 
lacked, however, is the competitive Kennedy spirit, especially in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. Joseph Tydings, a close friend of Robert Kennedy,  
remembers a touch football game when Kathleen was 10 or 11. She and 
her father went up against Tydings and another man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if they beat us or not, but if they didn't, it  
was damned close,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From an early age, Ms. Townsend was expected to shoulder some  
responsibility for her 10 siblings and many cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her most cherished possessions -- framed and hanging in a  
hallway of her Victorian home in suburban Baltimore -- is this 
letter Robert Kennedy wrote to his 12-year-old daughter the day 
President John F. Kennedy was buried: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Kathleen. You seem to understand that Jack died and was  
buried today. As the oldest of the Kennedy grandchildren, you have 
a particular responsibility now -- a special responsibility to John 
and Joe. Be kind to others and work for your country. Love, 
Daddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter referred to her brother Joe and to cousin John  
Kennedy Jr., who had turned 3 that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's son was killed July 16 in a private plane crash  
off Martha's Vineyard. The Townsends accompanied President Clinton 
and his family to New York City for the Kennedy memorial service 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kennedy's trust in his daughter was not misplaced.  
Friends say Ms. Townsend can be counted on in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	She took the lead in defending Joe against criticism he'd tried  
to bully his first wife into an annulment of their 12-year 
marriage, two years after they divorced. In 1979, she went to court 
to become brother David's legal guardian, to try to rescue him from 
drug abuse. He had the guardianship revoked a year later and died 
of an overdose in 1984. Another brother, Michael, was killed in a 
skiing accident Dec. 31, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, David, said in a 1997 interview with The Boston  
Globe Magazine that Ms. Townsend ``plays an enormous leadership 
role in the family. When something happens, like with one of her 
brothers, she is called immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend's first run for office, for Congress in 1986, made  
her the first Kennedy to lose a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	She picked up the pieces and formed the Maryland Student Service  
Alliance in partnership with the state education department, where 
she developed the nation's only statewide program that requires 
public school students to perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, she joined the U.S. Justice Department as a deputy  
assistant attorney general in charge of community policing 
programs, 
</P>
<P>
	Some might have considered her brief political career long dead,  
but in 1994, Parris Glendening surprised all of Maryland by asking 
her to be his lieutenant governor running mate. They won by fewer 
than 6,000 votes but last year won re-election with a margin of 
almost 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Townsend now ``enjoys extremely strong popularity across the  
state,'' says pollster Keith Haller of Potomac Survey research. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of her beliefs diverge from liberal Democratic  
positions associated with Kennedys -- she supports the death 
penalty, for example -- she has defended her positions as very much 
in line with lessons learned from her father. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime friend, Democratic political consultant Bob Shrum,  
said positions may differ, ``but if the question is, does she carry 
on the underlying idealism that motivated her father, I think it's 
clear she does.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Feels Growing Pains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Reform Party's palpable sense of  
confidence, fueled by the election of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, 
has become tempered by inside squabbling and power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the election of a new chairman could fuel dissent. Jack  
Gargan, chosen over two other hopefuls on Sunday, has promised not 
to support another presidential run by Ross Perot. The retired 
financial consultant from Florida also says he will move the 
party's headquarters from Perot's Dallas offices to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The party must weather such storms as part of its growth, said  
Pat Benjamin, vice chairwoman of the party and one of the two 
people who ran against Gargan, as she watched a fight between New 
Jersey delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these things is growing pains. At this stage,  
everything is important,'' said Benjamin, of Cherry Hill, N.J., who 
was second in the chairmanship race. ``This is democracy. It isn't 
pretty today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The party's lack of unity is of great concern, said Gargan, who  
won Ventura's endorsement in the balloting to succeed outgoing 
party Chairman Russ Verney. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer delegates came to this year's convention than in the past  
two years, Gargan noted. Only 350 of the 585 delegates showed up 
for the Reform Party's weekend convention, and the party also is 
losing ballot access in some states, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan said the state of the party was the reason he ran for  
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want the damned job, but I've got too much at stake,''  
he said. ``I have so much at stake I'm not about to let this ship 
go down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party's troubles may stem in part from its mission:  
welcoming people who want change and are disenchanted by other 
parties. That attracts so many different kinds of people that it's 
hard to develop a unified message. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have everyone, from people who think Jesse Jackson is too  
conservative to people who think Pat Buchanan is too liberal,'' 
said Tom McLaughlin, the Pennsylvania state chairman and the third 
candidate on the chairmanship ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	McLaughlin estimated that there are eight to 10 factions within  
the party. He said the party can be unified as long as its platform 
sticks to economic issues like balancing the budget, reducing the 
national debt and campaign finance reform. Social issues should be 
left for the individual candidates to decide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all members agree with McLaughlin, however. Richard Kline, a  
Reform Party gubernatorial candidate in Missouri, joined the party 
because Democrats in his state wouldn't support his anti-abortion 
stance. He wants the Reform Party to adopt a pro-life position. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite such difficulties, the party is making some important  
strides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minnesota in 1998 shocked the world. It is time for us to  
shock the world in the 2000 presidential election,'' Ventura 
bellowed to conventioneers on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura couldn't come to the conference because of severe  
weather that day in Detroit, but that didn't stop rumors that he 
was avoiding the conference to set himself apart from Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney, the outgoing chairman, told members not to get  
discouraged and to continue focusing on organization, communication 
and unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the leadership skills in place, we have the  
infrastructure, and the future is ours,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Raiders' Allen Gets Over Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With AP Photo    	
</P>
<P>
	NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- With Albert Lewis now retired, Eric Allen  
was asked if he was comfortable in assuming the role of elder 
statesman for the Oakland Raiders' secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I guess so,'' he said with a smile Sunday after the  
Raiders' second day of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, a 12-year-veteran and an unquestionable leader, comes off  
of knee surgery and is eager to join a cornerback staff that 
includes former Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson and offseason 
acquisition Darrien Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like everything is new again. It's like your  
rookie year,'' he said. ``Everything is the first time for me since 
the knee injury. You have to get back your timing, your confidence 
in your knee. But I feel good. I think everything is progressing 
pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, 33, tore his left anterior cruciate ligament on an  
interception return at Seattle on Nov. 15. Before his departure, 
the Raiders were 7-2. After it, they were 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
	His fellow defensive backs were also plagued by injuries. Free  
safety Eric Turner hurt his foot, while strong safety Anthony 
Newman was bothered by ankle and toe troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodson, eventually named the league's Defensive Rookie of the  
Year, was the only starter to appear in all 16 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Greg Biekert was looking forward to having everyone  
healthy again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to get going again,'' Biekert said. ``It's been a  
while since we've had both Erics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intense but good-natured, Allen is already proving on the  
practice field that he's back in playing shape. On Saturday, he 
made two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he needs to test his knee and some of the younger guys  
need field time, however, he's easing back into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're letting me be flexible. It depends how I feel:  
if I feel I want to push it, if I want to back off and need some 
time,'' he said. ``It's kind of a gray area for me, and they're 
allowing me to go at my own pace. They know I'm not going to cheat 
myself. If anything, they're going to have to hold me back a little 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jon Gruden said Allen has more than proven how effective  
he can be when healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's made great progress and we see real good signs for his  
return to full health,'' Gruden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, a 16-year veteran, moved from cornerback to safety last  
season. He made the transition successfully, grabbing his first 
career interception return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	At 38, Lewis decided to call it quits in the offseason. His  
presence as a gentleman and a leader in the locker room will be 
missed, but Allen is more than capable of taking the reins. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're never going to have the same chemistry when guys  
leave,'' Allen said. ``But the things you can do and accomplish can 
be the same.''

<HEADLINE> Ellen-DeGeneres Mulls TV Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Ellen DeGeneres is mulling a return to  
network television despite what she has called a bruising 
experience with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress-comedian has been negotiating with CBS for a new  
comedy in which she would play the host of a TV variety show, 
Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive officer of CBS 
Television, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The series, intended for the 2000-01 season, would focus on the  
character's off- and on-camera life. 
</P>
<P>
	Both DeGeneres and her character on ``Ellen'' came out as  
lesbians in April 1997. When the show's ratings dropped and it was 
canceled about a year later, DeGeneres accused the network of 
sabotaging her program. 
</P>
<P>
	The character's sexual orientation on the new show has not been  
discussed, but it wouldn't matter to the network if she were 
lesbian or not, executives told the Television Critics Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Since ``Ellen,'' DeGeneres has appeared in films including  
``EdTV'' and ``The Love Letter.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Jump More Than 5 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices jumped about 5 cents in  
the past two weeks, spurred by higher crude oil prices and 
increased demand caused by recovering world economies, according to 
an industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average on Friday, including all grades  
and taxes, was $1.2671, up 5.18 cents from the previous survey 
conducted July 9, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg 
Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the highest price in more than 18 months and the biggest  
hike nationally since late March, Ms. Lundberg said Sunday. This 
comes after prices dropped significantly between early May and 
early June. 
</P>
<P>
	Pump prices are high compared to last year, but are comparable  
with prices in 1996 and 1997 during the same period, Ms. Lundberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She blamed the price hikes on production cuts by the  
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as 
recovering Asian and Latin American economies that now require more 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Globally, there's just a tighter balance between supply and  
demand,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pump prices were rising throughout the country but were most  
dramatic in the West, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At self-service pumps, the average for regular unleaded was  
$1.2108, mid-grade was $1.3107 and premium was $1.3956. 
</P>
<P>
	For full-service, regular was $1.5449, mid-grade averaged  
$1.6330 and premium $1.7071.

 *Martin Agronsky    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime television commentator Martin  
Agronsky, a voice from radio's golden age who created the ``talking 
heads'' television news format, died Sunday of congestive heart 
failure. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky began in newspaper journalism, became a war  
correspondent on radio and was a Washington correspondent, foreign 
correspondent and commentator for U.S. television from 1943 until 
he retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky's syndicated television program, ``Agronsky &AMP;  
Company,'' ended in early 1988 after an 18-year run. It was the 
nation's top-ranked public affairs program when Agronsky retired. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which began as a newscast on Washington's WTOP-TV, now  
WUSA-TV, was considered the first to use the informal format of 
reporters talking among themselves rather than interviewing 
newsmakers. The format, generally with newsmakers participating, 
became the stock-in-trade of today's Sunday talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agronsky &AMP; Company'' ran less than a year as a local newscast,  
but the concept was spun off into a program syndicated on 
commercial and public television stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Agronsky's first job was in 1936 as general assignment reporter  
for the Palestine Post, now the Jerusalem Post. Before he retired, 
he had worked for all three major networks and PBS, generally in 
high-profile positions.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- William Targ, a former editor who agreed to

He was 92.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Pres. Denies Cap Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy said  
he is cooperating fully with the NFL and is innocent of any 
wrongdoing concerning charges the San Francisco 49ers violated the 
salary cap while under his control. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy and Dwight Clark, the Browns director of football  
operations who followed Policy from San Francisco, came under 
investigation by the league earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the 49ers issued a statement saying the NFL was  
looking into the case of a player contract during the time when 
Policy was the team's president and Clark was general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The player is reportedly tight end Brent Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he was involved in any under-the-table payments to  
Jones, Policy said, ``No. No. No. Exclamation point. No. But I 
don't even think that is what is alleged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy had deferred comment on the allegations until Sunday when  
he and Cleveland owner Al Lerner met with reporters during the 
Browns' afternoon practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stories about the 49ers and the cap have existed since the cap  
was created,'' Policy said. ``I think it's a situation that the 
league is looking at a fact pattern and we're cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've already cooperated with them early and we're cooperating  
further. I think it will turn out to be a situation that is not 
reflective of any kind of violation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league was provided information by 49ers owner Denise  
DeBartolo York and her husband, John York, who continue to squabble 
with Eddie DeBartolo for control of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy faces a maximum $250,000 fine if found guilty of any  
salary cap infractions. The 49ers could be fined $2 million and 
could lose future draft picks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks $1B for Veterans' Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is asking Congress  
to add $1 billion in spending for veterans' health programs in the 
budget year that begins Oct. 1, Vice President Al Gore said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore set the announcement at Nashville International Airport as  
the kickoff of a day of appearances in his native Tennessee that 
included both official chores and a fund-raising reception for his 
2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House budget office was forwarding the request in a  
letter to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared remarks, Gore said the $1 billion includes $800  
million to hire more medical workers ``and take other steps 
necessary to reduce waiting time and ensure quality care'' at 
Department of Veterans Affairs facilities; $100 million for home- 
and community based long-term care services and $100 million to 
help ``upgrade outdated and decaying facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the additional spending could be paid for under the  
administration's current budget request. He noted that he had 
served in Vietnam, where he was an Army journalist, and co-founded 
the Vietnam-era veterans caucus in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes several days after Sen. Paul Wellstone,  
D-Minn., said a survey by his office found that 20 of the 22 VA 
health care networks would have spending shortfalls under the 
administration's $17.3 billion veterans health request for 2000. 
Veterans groups, citing the millions of World War II and Korean 
veterans at or approaching old age, have estimated the spending gap 
at $3 billion.

	Russian Cargo Plane Crashes  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian military plane with seven crew members  
on board crashed shortly after take-off from the Siberian city of 
Irkutsk on Monday, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. There 
was no immediate word on casualties, but rescue teams were at the 
crash site searching for survivors, according to the Federal 
Aviation Service. The plane, with 30 tons of cargo on board, went 
down just after departing from Irkutsk, and was headed to Perm in 
the Ural Mountains, officials said.

United Nations to bolster confidence in their ability to provide 
security in Kosovo, many Serbs remain skeptical and even fear for 
their lives. A meeting of the new transitional government committee 
of ethnic Albanians and Serbs, scheduled for Monday, was postponed 
after Serbs requested a delay to prepare for the funeral of 14 Serb 
farmers. The farmers were killed in a wheat field near the central 
Kosovo village of Gracko on Friday -- a display of violence that has 
put the U.N. goal of a peaceful, multiethnic Kosovo in jeopardy.

an American spy plane that disappeared while on a counternarcotics 
mission over rebel-dominated territory. U.S. officials say the 
plane was on a routine mission over an area where drug crops are 
grown when it disappeared Saturday from radar screens. Its 
disappearance, however, was likely to heighten speculation in 
Colombia that Washington is getting deeply involved in the 
country's 35-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> Two Centuries Parade on Pa. Avenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pennsylvania Avenue was a line on a map before  
it was a street, but there was symbolism in it even then. The 
avenue would be the pulsing artery of a democratic republic, 
linking the executive and legislative powers while physically 
preserving their separation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre L'Enfant, a testy, French-born military engineer, drew  
the map of Washington in 1791, discarding the ``tiresome and 
insipid'' grid of streets most cities wore and imposing wide and 
radiating avenues. The unbuilt city would grow like a tree, he 
thought, and the one-mile stretch of avenue between the Capitol and 
the White House would be its trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been many times in the last two centuries when  
the true distance between the lawmakers on their hill and the 
presidents in their mansion have seemed broader than any ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania Avenue has been both magnificent and shabby, a  
place where the nation's triumphs are celebrated and its losses 
mourned. It's been a street where generals reviewed troops, where 
sailors on leave had their arms tattooed, where ordinary people 
shopped for tomatoes and oysters and dined on crab cakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The avenue's darkest moment came in August 1814 when a file of  
British sailors, the flaming Capitol at their back, marched 
silently down the avenue to torch the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1995, after the bombing of the federal building in  
Oklahoma City, the block-long stretch of the avenue in front of the 
White House was permanently closed to motor vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The inaugural parade was created when a crowd of lawmakers,  
young boys and ``distinguished strangers'' trailed Thomas Jefferson 
back to the White House in 1805 as he began his second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Every four years since, brass bands and marching troops have  
escorted newly inaugurated presidents down the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders galloped for their chief in  
1905; Franklin Roosevelt's jaunty, jaw-jutting grin set the tone in 
1933; Jimmy Carter left a black limousine and walked in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	And on an icy inaugural day in 1961, John Kennedy made a  
promise: He would do what he could as president to revive and 
transform the shabby warren of rundown commercial buildings that 
ran along the avenue's south side. 
</P>
<P>
	The promise took more than 20 years to keep, far longer than the  
time required to keep another Kennedy promise -- to send Americans 
to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Civil War engulfed the avenue with uniforms and vice.  
</P>
<P>
	In the side streets, one red-light district was dubbed ``Murder  
Bay.'' And Gen. Joseph Hooker earned a dubious immortality when an 
encampment of his troops was called ``Hooker's division'' and the 
prostitutes who worked there became ``hookers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham Lincoln was photographed at Matthew Brady's studios on  
Pennsylvania Avenue. John Wilkes Booth, the actor, lived in a hotel 
on the avenue and crossed it as he fled after shooting Lincoln at 
Ford's Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	The victorious Army of the Potomac passed in review by the  
thousands in May 1865, to be followed the next day by the lanky 
Westerners who fought with William Tecumseh Sherman's Army of the 
Tennessee. Sherman's bands had a new tune to play: ``Marching 
Through Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the street, like the town, wasn't much at the start. In  
1801, a congressman from Connecticut trying to walk from the 
Capitol to the president's house found ``a deep morass covered with 
elder bushes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1803, Jefferson ordered double rows of fast-growing Lombardy  
poplars planted on either side of the avenue. In Andrew Jackson's 
time 30 years later, elms were planted instead. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time of the Civil War the street was largely commercial,  
and largely unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
	When the wind gusted on Pennsylvania Avenue it stirred  
``cyclones of dust,'' New York publisher Horace Greeley wrote just 
after the war. ``The mud before breakfast is dust before noon,'' 
another journalist observed. 
</P>
<P>
	When some proposed that Washington be selected as the site of an  
1871 international fair, a senator remarked, ``Let us have a city 
before we invite anyone to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was hard to get it right.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington spent $2 million in 1871 to pave Pennsylvania Avenue  
with wooden blocks, swept it as clean as a parlor floor, lit it 
with calcium lamps, gas jets and Japanese lanterns and celebrated 
with masquerades and goat-cart races. 
</P>
<P>
	But the celebration was premature. Wagon and carriage wheels and  
horses' hooves cracked the blocks into chips and splinters and the 
street was in worse shape then before. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Beautiful movement at the start of the 20th century  
eventually produced the Federal Triangle. That wedge of 
stone-columned government buildings on the north side of the avenue 
starkly contrasted with the near-slum President Kennedy saw when he 
looked across the street and made his promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next quarter-century, the avenue slowly changed.  
</P>
<P>
	There are now new fountains and pools, restored landmarks and  
theaters, new hotels and offices and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	Youthful skateboarders swerve and swivel across a plaza embedded  
with a giant map of the avenue, a plaza inscribed with quotations 
about the history of a city of ``magnificent intentions.''

<HEADLINE> Passengers Fly Europe Cheap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISHOP'S STORTFORD, Britain (AP) -- David Leport flaunted his  
boarding pass like a card shark with a winning hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineering student paid all of $27 for a round-trip ticket  
home to Dinard, France, on the regional airline Ryanair. 
</P>
<P>
	``It costs me more to park my car here for five days than it  
does to take this flight,'' Leport, 25, said recently at Stansted 
Airport north of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Leport, a growing number of Europeans are traveling to and  
from small, often remote airports in order to save big money on 
international flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-cost airlines spawned by the recent deregulation of Europe's  
aviation industry are able to offer cheaper fares by avoiding many 
of the costlier, big-city airports favored by their larger rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	While British Airways flies from Heathrow and Gatwick, London's  
two main airports, newcomer easyJet operates from a much smaller 
airport in the outlying town of Luton, 32 miles north of London. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France serves Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris,  
but low-cost carrier Debonair flies to Cergy Pontoise, a 
little-used airport in an industrial zone of the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
	These second-tier airports can be an hour's drive from the  
nearest big city. Yet the surge in flights suggests that 
bargain-hunters are only too happy to fly to them, even if it means 
connecting to their final destinations by bus or train. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no queues for taxis and no queues for check-in.  
There's just not the same stress level as at the bigger, more 
congested airports,'' said Ethel Power, a spokeswoman for 
Dublin-based Ryanair. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by Southwest Airlines and other low-cost U.S. carriers,  
the regional upstarts are attracting customers despite their 
no-frills service and spotty record for punctuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the new airlines are based in Britain, where aviation  
authorities have been among the strongest supporters of the 
deregulation that began in Europe in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not trying to steal market share from established  
airlines. What they're trying to do is stimulate additional demand 
that wouldn't have been there otherwise, through the introduction 
of low fares,'' said Guy Kekwick, an analyst in London with the 
U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Low-cost airlines making short, regional flights command less  
than 5 percent of Europe's aviation market, but they're growing 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger traffic at Luton Airport, home to easyJet and  
Debonair, has increased by almost a third in each of the past two 
years. EasyJet had two flights a day when it began operating from 
Luton in 1995; today, it has 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Stansted, 35 miles north of London in Bishop's Stortford, has  
seen similar rates of growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Some big carriers such as Lufthansa and Alitalia, are responding  
with plans for similar low-cost subsidiaries of their own. British 
Airways' entry into the market is called Go. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winners from this trend are customers.  
</P>
<P>
	Debonair, for example, flies from Luton to Rome for a round-trip  
fare of $188. By comparison, a typical economy-class ticket on a 
Lufthansa flight from Heathrow Airport to Rome costs $306. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct comparisons with fares on U.S. domestic flights are hard  
to make, due to the myriad special fares possible for flights on 
both sides of the Atlantic. But air travel has typically cost less 
in the United States than in Europe, largely because deregulation 
of the American airline industry began some 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	To help keeps fares to a minimum, the low-cost carriers have  
stripped their in-flight service to its bare essentials, making 
passengers pay for drinks and forgoing in-flight meals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever gives you champagne on the bus. Why are consumers  
brought up to expect that on a plane?'' said easyJet spokesman 
James Rothnie. 
</P>
<P>
	Strict regulations in Europe discourage low-cost airlines from  
cutting corners on safety. The downside to flying with them is 
suggested by anecdotal evidence of delays and penalties for 
changing departure dates. 
</P>
<P>
	But independents like easyJet and Debonair say their fortunes  
hinge on whether they can compete with the low-cost subsidiaries of 
the big airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	And because they fly along some of the same routes, competition  
between the smaller airlines is all the more intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shared madness,'' said Franco Mancassola, Debonair's  
founder and chief executive. ``This business could thrive for all 
of us, even the little guys, if we allow it to develop with 
intelligence instead of trying to muscle each other away from 
routes.''

<HEADLINE> Feed the Children's Income on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Donations of cash and goods to the Oklahoma  
City-based charity Feed the Children are jumping, although much of 
the cash goes to pay expenses, The Sunday Oklahoman reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual contributions more than doubled from $95.9 million in  
1994, the year before the Oklahoma City federal building bombing 
focused attention on the charity, to $204.5 million for the fiscal 
year ended September 1998, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that amount, $47.5 million was in cash and the rest was food,  
child-care items, educational materials, medical supplies, building 
materials and other goods.

	``We are more of a distributor ... between the corporations and  
the hungry folks,'' said founder Larry Jones.

<P>
	The charity's 1997-98 tax forms show that the bulk of the cash  
went to pay administration, operations and fund-raising expenses, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	That included $25.8 million for direct mail appeals, postage and  
weekly television shows featuring needy families and sometimes

<P>
	Also covered in the expenditures is $4.4 million in pay and

who is the charity's in-house attorney. Jones said the charity has 
more than 400 employees, including 214 in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Wins Using Litespeed Bike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OOLTEWAH, Tenn. (AP) -- A little bike company near Chattanooga  
secretly shared in Lance Armstrong's triumph in Paris at the Tour 
De France on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60 employees at Litespeed Titanium Components know that  
Armstrong actually rides their bikes, despite the Trek logo that is 
painted on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Trek is the official sponsor of the U.S. Postal Service team.  
Since Armstrong prefers bikes from Litespeed, Trek purchases them 
at $6,000 each for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance was a member of the Motorola cycling team and we  
sponsored it in previous years, so he was familiar with the 
cycle,'' said David Lynskey, president of Litespeed, a family 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt like he wanted to ride nothing but the best, and asked  
us to fit him and provide him the equipment, and we did so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynskey said the alloy tubing used for Armstrong's bikes is  
twice as strong and half as heavy as the tubing used for most 
bikes.

	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Roy Lassiter and Cary Talley scored to  
give depleted DC United a 2-0 victory Sunday over the New England 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory improves the Eastern Conference-leading United to  
13-7, seven points ahead of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	DC, missing seven starters due to international duty or injury,  
opened the scoring in the 11th minute through Lassiter, who headed 
in a short lob by Clint Peay on the left side, beating Walter Zenga 
from nine yards along the left post. Lassiter, MLS's leading 
goalscorer, now has 15 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	United added to its lead in the 33rd minute when Talley scored  
off an Antonio Otero corner kick on the left side as he headed the 
ball just inside the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	New England (8-10) didn't get its first shot until the 50th  
minute when Jamar Beasley was denied by Tom Prestus, who made a

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Wins Fake Faulkner Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- A rambling, 500-word sentence about an odd  
Mississippi railroad crossing took top honors in the annual contest 
challenging William Faulkner lovers to imitate the Nobel Prize 
winner's unique writing style. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner Samuel Tumey, a small-town Mississippi lawyer, won the  
contest for a second time. He read his entry Sunday in Oxford, the 
home of the author who died in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Tumey has entered nearly every year of the contest's 10-year  
run, saying he aims for a ``pretentious, flowery'' opening to a 
sentence that goes on and on and on -- and is funny. 
</P>
<P>
	His winning parody deals with a railroad crossing in the  
Mississippi Delta known as the spot ``where the Southern crosses 
the dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tumey said Faulkner never wrote about the Delta but would have  
probably appreciated the story of the railroad crossing where the 
Southern Railroad track intersected at a right angle with the 
``Yellow Dog'' line (the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad). 
</P>
<P>
	He pinpoints the spot in his entry to Moorhead, Miss., which  
``was not fabled or even where anybody much wanted to go .... 
</P>
<P>
	``but if you had to go there,'' the passage continues, ``or if  
you had an obsession to find the very place that your mother had 
told you about (or maybe if you worked for a Yankee newspaper) you 
could find a green sign that says this is the only right angle 
railroad crossing in all the civilized world ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's truly crazy Mississippi at its best. Only in Mississippi  
would anybody have let two railroads cross at an angle,'' said 
Larry Wells, a contest organizer who is married to Faulkner's 
niece, Dean Faulkner Wells. ``It's almost a rite of passage in 
Mississippi to find out where the Southern crossed the dog. It's a 
real legend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tumey's piece bested a take on President Bill Clinton's  
dalliance with Monica Lewinsky titled ``Soundbites and Furies,'' an 
offshoot of the Faulkner title, ``The Sound and the Fury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wendy Goldberg of Mountain View, Calif., wrote of Monika  
Flewinsky and her ability to ``reduce this fine figure of a man who 
walks with popes and kings and Hillary to a finger-wagging petulant 
school boy clumsily conjugating `is' was itself the match that lit 
the fire that burnt the bridge that Bill was busting to build to 
the 21st Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tumey, 51, from Liberty, population 600, won the contest in 1994  
with a parody of an Ole Miss football game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking about retiring like Rocky Marciano or Michael  
Jordan, but I had to make a comeback,'' Tumey said. ``It gives you 
a thrill. You say `hey this is good.' But you try to restrain 
yourself. It's just a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said with two victories, ``I'm planning to retire this  
time.'' Then he adds, unless ``something really good comes along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future of the annual contest is in doubt for 2000 because  
sponsor Jack Daniel's Distillery decided to withdraw after this 
year's contest.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Launches Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the third time in six weeks,  
Boeing has successfully launched a quartet of Globalstar 
communication satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta II rocket blasted off at 3:46 a.m. Sunday and placed  
the four satellites in orbit -- boosting the number of Globalstar 
satellites to 32. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been able to launch one-fourth of the Globalstar  
satellites into orbit during this time, and we look forward to 
continued success,'' said Darryl Van Dorn, a Delta program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing plans to launch another Delta with four more Globalstar  
satellites next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Globalstar, based in San Jose, Calif., plans to begin providing  
wireless telephone service this fall. Altogether, 48 satellites are 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's launch cost about $115 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The Globalstar consortium of 12 companies was founded by Loral  
Space and Communications Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.

<HEADLINE> Internet Security Fights Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- JonnyX says no computer system is unhackable and  
he doubts an impenetrable network could ever be produced. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hacker, who didn't want his real name used, admits it  
would take some serious work to break through a security system 
with a neural network -- computer programs that can remember events 
and ``learn'' trends and tendencies of intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet security researchers at Georgia Tech believe the neural  
networks they are working on may be the key to stopping hackers, 
who have made headlines with recent break-ins at high-profile sites 
such as The New York Times, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take a shift in the way people think about  
computers and how they operate before we are ever truly secure,'' 
said Blaine Burnham, a former National Security Administration 
security specialist who now heads Georgia Tech's Information 
Security Center. ``But we've started that process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Georgia Tech's The Sentinel Project doesn't  
``think,'' the group of programs is set up in different ``nodes'' 
much like a human brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are much like neurons or synapses,'' said Jim Cannady, a  
Security Center researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Neurons in your brain learn from experiences, creating synapses,  
or connections, between one part of the brain and another. The 
neural network works similarly, although it is ``just a rough 
emulation,'' Cannady said. 
</P>
<P>
	The network is designed to recognize small increases in abnormal  
data, which could signal that someone has broken into the system. 
The neural networks would also update themselves to fight against 
new approaches hackers attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Current systems require administrators to constantly update  
every possible attack option or system weakness. As hackers try new 
approaches, that list is continually growing, meaning 
administrators are always playing catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Neural networks) would work a little more mysteriously and  
mean you'd have to take a little more on faith, but they would 
streamline the process incredibly,'' said Cannady, who projects a 
usable version within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds interesting, says JonnyX, 31, but he doubts the network  
would keep him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neural networks would be cool, if they work,'' he said. ``But  
I don't think any system will ever be truly secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best security alternatives now available also came  
from Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by a 1983 science-fiction novel, former Georgia Tech  
student Chris Klaus invented a program that finds the weaknesses in 
a system from within. It allows system operators to see the network 
from a hacker's point of view instead of relying on a standard 
firewall, which attempts to keep all unwanted traffic out of a 
company's network. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we have about 2,000 threats and vulnerabilities on  
our database and the list is continually growing,'' said Klaus, 25, 
who initially released his Internet Security Scanner for free while 
he was a Tech student in 1992. He has since become a 
multimillionaire after starting a computer security company. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the advances made by Klaus' Internet Security  
Systems, researchers and hackers agree that most companies' 
Internet security is woeful. 
</P>
<P>
	JonnyX, who works as a computer consultant in Nashville, Tenn.,  
said most hackers break in just because they can. 
</P>
<P>
	During an Atlanta symposium on hacking earlier this month,  
JonnyX said companies usually ignore security until it's too late, 
then don't press charges against hackers to avoid negative 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are CEOs out there that would rather admit to being a  
pedophile than admit to their shareholders that they've been 
hacked,'' said Jim Butler, an Atlanta attorney specializing in 
Internet and electronic privacy law. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnham said it will take a ``Pearl Harbor'' type event such as  
a massive theft of credit card numbers from a site like Amazon.com 
or a wire transfer out of a bank to make companies to improve 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	But programmers and hackers agree that even companies that  
invest in advancements such as neural networks or other programs 
shouldn't let their guard down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are banks totally secure?,'' JonnyX said. ``They've been  
around a long time, and people still rob them. Until the computer 
and the Internet stops being sexy and becomes an everyday household 
appliance, security will remain an issue.''

<HEADLINE> Lobbying for China Trade Steps Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When lawmakers opened their hometown  
newspapers recently, they found full-page ads from the Business 
Roundtable declaring that China's growing economy meant an 
increased appetite for U.S. food, cars and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
	When their aides brought in the mail, they found letters from  
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with exact figures on how much in 
products and services their home states exported to China last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	And when they returned home for the Fourth of July recess, they  
found local members of the National Association of Manufacturers on 
their schedules for meetings to discuss China trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just been making a point (that) at every one of those  
meetings ... somebody stands up and says, `I want to explain the 
importance of the China issue to the American manufacturing 
community,''' said Howard Lewis, the NAM's vice president for 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bumpy year in U.S.-Chinese relations, the U.S. business  
community is taking nothing for granted in its annual battle to 
renew China's normal trade relations with the United States. U.S. 
businesses exported $18 billion in goods and services to China last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced on June 3 he was renewing the  
status, but Congress has 90 days to overturn it if it chooses. 
Lawmakers are set to vote as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The business lobby particularly is concerned that a bipartisan  
congressional investigation that recently concluded Beijing stole 
U.S. nuclear secrets might jeopardize the decision to allow free 
trade between China and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is harder,'' acknowledged Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., former  
chief executive officer of Corning Inc., known for its 
glass-science breakthroughs, and a strong supporter of normal trade 
relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
	The stepped-up lobbying effort is visible everywhere. For  
instance, the Business Roundtable targeted just a dozen lawmakers 
last year during its China trade lobbying efforts. This year, its 
sights are set on 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has not been an issue more heavily lobbied,'' Rep.  
Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Chamber of Commerce officials argue that normal trade  
relations and problems outlined in the espionage report by the 
committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., are separate 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Espionage is a way of life. We have to protect against it.  
That has nothing to do with trade,'' chamber lobbyist William 
Morley said. He is telling lawmakers that their vote will be 
counted when the organization compiles its annual vote ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	The chamber's president, Tom Donohue, delivered a similar  
message to Cox, who agrees that the two issues should not be 
linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible to have any China policy one wishes while  
attending to the counterintelligence and security problems in our 
report,'' Cox said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents cite both the Cox report and the 1996 campaign finance  
scandal as reasons for rejecting normal trade relations. Rep. Frank 
Wolf, R-Va., brings it up during his discussions with GOP freshmen, 
urging them to vote no. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer has made  
his opposition to China trade well-known. ``I'm a janitor's son, 
and I believe in free enterprise, but I don't believe in putting 
your country second and putting your profits first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters are hoping for an overwhelming vote of support to  
give impetus to efforts to bring China into the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to sending heavyweight corporate executives to talk  
to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, they also have asked lower-level 
employees in congressional districts to call the district offices 
of their local representatives to deliver the same message: Free 
trade means jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Each lawmaker has gotten a letter from the Chamber of Commerce  
with state-by-state statistics showing the value of trade with 
China. For example, New York exported $679 million worth of goods 
in 1998, California $2.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> 'Haunting' Scares Away Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Haunting'' went bump at the box office  
as the high-tech ghost story premiered at No. 1 with $33 million, 
according to industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another effects-laden movie, ``Inspector Gadget,'' debuted in  
second place with $22 million. ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' a black 
comedy about teen beauty queens duking it out in middle America, 
opened weakly at 11th place with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' prequel, meanwhile, crossed the $400 million  
mark to become the third-highest grossing movie of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's top two movies debuted with good numbers despite  
reviews ranging from so-so to downright bad. It was the fourth 
straight No. 1 opening for ``Haunting'' director Jan De Bont, who 
also topped the box office with ``Speed,'' ``Twister'' and ``Speed 
2: Cruise Control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Haunting'' was helped by the increasing draw of stars Liam  
Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Based on a Shirley Jackson story, 
the movie is a remake of a 1963 thriller directed by Robert Wise. 
The remake uses dazzling computer effects to make a haunted house 
come alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an old-fashioned horror movie with a PG-13 rating, and  
you can't underestimate that rating for summertime play,'' said Jim 
Tharp, distribution chief for DreamWorks, which released ``The 
Haunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp said the PG-13 rating should help carry the movie next  
weekend, when horror phenomenon ``The Blair Witch Project'' expands 
from 31 theaters to about 1,000. ``Blair Witch,'' the story of 
three filmmakers who vanish on a witch hunt in the woods, is rated 
R. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget ``Blair Witch'' continued to sell out theaters,  
taking in $2 million for an average of about $64,500 a screen, more 
than five times ``The Haunting's'' average. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by good press buzz and a marketing campaign aimed to make  
the film look like a real-life documentary, Artisan Entertainment 
plans a wide release starting Friday. By Aug. 6, the movie could be 
in 1,500 to 2,000 theaters, said Artisan spokesman Paul Pflug. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan held off on wider distribution for ``Blair Witch'' until  
July 30 to avoid clashing with ``The Haunting,'' Pflug said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inspector Gadget'' is a live-action version of the TV cartoon  
starring Matthew Broderick as a detective rebuilt after an 
explosion with all-purpose gizmos and doodads inside him. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, which drew a largely family audience, benefitted from  
a theater slate crowded with more adult-oriented films. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross-out sex comedy ``American Pie'' slipped from second  
place to third, taking in $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kubrick's racy ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' starring Tom Cruise  
and Nicole Kidman, dropped from first place to fourth with $9.9 
million on its second weekend, down 54 percent since its $21.7 
million opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was No. 10 with  
$4.2 million for a total of $402.9 million since its May 19 
release. The ``Star Wars'' prequel edged past ``E.T.: The 
Extra-terrestrial'' into third place for all-time U.S. box office 
in actual dollars, behind ``Titanic'' and the original ``Star 
Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Haunting,'' $33 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Inspector Gadget,'' $22 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bears Submit New Proposal to McNown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Now it's Cade McNown's turn.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears submitted a revised contract proposal that  
they hope moves closer to what McNown and agent Tom Condon want, 
Bears' director of business operations Jim Miller said Sunday. 
Miller said he expected a response after Condon studied the 
proposal and talked to McNown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a few, which we think are substantive, changes in what  
we've proposed before,'' Miller said. ``It's an effort to get to 
that middle ground that we've been talking about. It's not as far 
as they'd like us to have gone, but anyway, it's something that we 
think we've made a substantial move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cautioned that the new proposal does not necessarily mean a  
deal is next. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing that I would categorize as monumental  
progress, imminent or anything like that,'' he said. ``We've made a 
move toward them, and let's just see how they respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sticking point in negotiations with McNown has been voidable  
years, which would allow him to opt out of the last two or three 
years of a long-term deal. While the Bears don't believe in 
voidable years, president Ted Phillips said the deal could be 
structured with ``elements of a voidable contract in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller didn't want to describe the proposal further until he  
heard from Condon. By late Sunday, Miller hadn't heard back from 
the agent. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th pick overall, has missed three days of training  
camp so far, though the Bears didn't practice Sunday. With veteran 
Erik Kramer's release two days before camp, it's clear McNown will 
be the team's No. 1 quarterback, and every day of practice he 
misses puts him further behind in learning the offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always optimistic, I've been optimistic since the start,''  
Miller said. ``But it's a change and we hope it's a change in their 
direction. That gives me some optimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, the Bears signed free agent Doug Nussmeier to a  
one-year deal, giving the team's other three quarterbacks some 
relief. The five-year NFL veteran was with the Indianapolis Colts 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a practical move with the heat,'' Miller said. ``You  
don't want to kill the guys you've got here.''

	Plane Wreckage Found in Colombia  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Wreckage spotted today on a mountainside  
in southwestern Colombia might be that of a U.S. Army plane that 
disappeared while on a counternarcotics mission over 
rebel-dominated territory, the U.S. Army said. U.S. officials say 
the plane was on a routine mission over an area where drug crops 
are grown when it disappeared from radar screens. Its 
disappearance, however, was likely to heighten speculation in 
Colombia that Washington is getting deeply involved in the 
country's 35-year civil war.

also a suspect in the killings of three park sightseers earlier 
this year, was arrested yesterday.

	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban authorities have detained four men from

The men were arrested off the Cuban coast about an hour apart 
Wednesday at two locations in the western province of Pinar del

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Longtime television commentator Martin  
Agronsky has died of heart failure in Washington at age 84. 
Agronsky is considered one of the pioneers of the ``talking heads'' 
television news format that features journalists talking to each 
other in a group about the latest events, rather than interviewing 
newsmakers. Agronsky began in newspaper journalism, then became a 
war correspondent on radio. From 1943 until he retired in 1988 he 
was a Washington correspondent, foreign correspondent and 
commentator for U.S. television.

Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 6-4 tonight for a three-game

leaking hydrogen fuel all the way to orbit last week from one of 
its main engines, NASA said today. If it proves to be a leak as 
photographs suggest, the engine could have shut down abruptly if 
more fuel had seeped out, resulting in a never-before-attempted

offer cheaper fares by avoiding many of the costlier, big-city 
airports favored by their larger rivals. These second-tier airports

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Pickens May Not Be At Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The leading receiver in Cincinnati Bengals  
history is threatening to quit rather than play one more day in 
stripes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals opening training camp this week assuming Carl  
Pickens will stay true to his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to go into it thinking that he's not going to be  
here,'' coach Bruce Coslet said. ``I'd love to have him back. I've 
said that all along, but what else can you say? That's why we made 
him the franchise player -- that's how much we think of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens made it clear that he wanted to leave as an unrestricted  
free agent. Instead, the Bengals designated him their franchise 
player, meaning he has to stay for $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens has threatened to retire. So far, he's given no  
indication he'll be in Georgetown, Ky., when training camp opens 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he wants to stay home and forego $3.5 million, that would  
be a decision that he can make, but I'd scratch my head a little 
bit about it,'' general manager Mike Brown said. ``Sometimes these 
things spiral down and crash. I would like to think at some point 
he would come around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pickens, 29, became the franchise's career leader in receptions  
and receiving touchdowns last season. He has been the Bengals' 
leading receiver for four of the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals are willing to trade Pickens, just as they did Dan  
Wilkinson after they made him their franchise player. But no one 
has offered a deal to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to have a fire sale,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Coslet to plan for an offense that will function  
without Pickens. Darnay Scott would become the No. 1 receiver. No 
other receiver had as many as 20 catches for the Bengals last 
season.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's Pan Am Delegates Upset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuba's delegation to the Pan American  
Games claimed Sunday its athletes were being encouraged to defect 
by the Canadian media. 
</P>
<P>
	A Cuban athlete and a journalist have already defected, and Jose  
Ramon Fernandez, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, said the 
delegation was ``very upset'' at the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked for asylum before the  
games, and police said Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde has also 
defected. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is contrary to the Olympic spirit and to the  
sports spirit in general,'' Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez said he was most angry about a statement signed by  
Enrico Blanco, a boxer who left Cuba in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was expected to be tight for Cuba's powerful baseball  
team, which began play Sunday night against Mexico, and its boxers, 
who start Friday.

	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- A Union Pacific train derailed while  
traveling from Los Angeles to Tucson, Ariz., knocking 11 cars onto

chromium trioxide, a highly combustible substance when mixed with 
water and toxic if inhaled. That car, however, remained on the 
tracks, McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> No Frenchman Has Won Tour Since '85 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARPAJON, France (AP) -- Christian Mahe, a 17-year-old cycling  
fan, is one of the millions of French teen-agers who never saw a 
countryman win the Tour de France, the quintessential French event. 
</P>
<P>
	Proudly wearing a polka dot cap in honor of French rider Richard  
Virenque, he was among the crowds at the start line of Sunday's 
final stage, from Arpajon to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real shame that one of our guys can't win. After all,  
this is the Tour de France,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mais oui.  
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1985 has a Frenchman pedaled into Paris wearing the  
famous yellow jersey of the champion. This year's race, which ended 
in American Lance Armstrong's remarkable triumph, marked the first 
time since 1926 that a Frenchman didn't win a single stage of the 
Tour. And it was only the fourth time since World War II that one 
didn't figure in the top five overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Though nothing seemed to diminish their enthusiasm for the  
world's top cycling event, French fans are nonetheless bewildered 
at the performance of their riders. 
</P>
<P>
	They're bewildered about other sports, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The Champs-Elysees, where the Tour's finale took place, is where  
hundreds of thousands streamed a year ago to bask in the glow of 
France's surprising World Cup triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, however, there hasn't been much to celebrate.  
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday, Jean Van de Velde went from sure winner to eventual  
playoff loser in seven shocking strokes at the British Open, the 
most stunning collapse in major championship golf history. 
</P>
<P>
	The national rugby team is coming off a terrible string of  
losses, including 54-7 to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Tour's inception in 1903, French riders have won a  
record 36 times. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1970s and 1980s, the legendary French duo of Bernard  
Hinault and Laurent Fignon dominated the race, winning seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last triumph for a French rider was Hinault's way back  
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame for the public that a French rider didn't win a  
stage. It isn't so good for French morale,'' Tour director 
Jean-Marie Leblanc said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the quality of French cycling isn't up to scratch at the  
moment. But don't forget Jalabert isn't here,'' he said, meaning 
the world's No. 1 rider, Laurent Jalabert. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Italy's Marco Pantani won. In 1997 it was Germany's  
Jan Ullrich and the year before it was Denmark's Bjarne Riis. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the last four years, the French have had only one  
top-five rider. On Sunday, Virenque was their best-placed finisher 
-- eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	French cyclist Thierry Gouvenou noted that this year's race  
began with 43 Italians, compared with only 39 Frenchmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tour is getting more international, so it is logical that  
we aren't winning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the French media was making no excuses.  
</P>
<P>
	The headline in the sports daily L'Equipe: ``The French, what a  
mess!''

<HEADLINE> China Defiant on Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- China will only meet conditions to get into the  
World Trade Organization that are required of other developing 
countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said Sunday after 
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	``China would not swallow the bitter fruit in order to get into  
the WTO,'' Tang told a news conference after lunching with Albright 
on the sidelines of a Southeast Asia security forum. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was expecting Albright to bring up the subject of the  
WTO. ``She didn't do that,'' Tang said. ``I was also surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``China's accession to the WTO is required by China's efforts to  
reform and open up to the outside world,'' Tang said. ``On the 
other hand, without China's participation, the WTO is not 
complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington missed a ``precious opportunity'' to seal China's WTO  
membership during Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's April visit to the 
United States, when Zhu and President Clinton failed to come to 
terms on China's admission into the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said China's offers did not go far enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``When Premier Zhu got back to China, things got more difficult  
because the bombing incident happened shortly afterwards,'' he 
said, referring to the May 7 NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, which killed three people. The United States has said it 
was an accident, but China remains unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang said he had concluded bilateral meetings with Japan and  
Australia on the WTO issue and would pursue it further with other 
WTO members. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural trade conflicts have been one of the major reasons  
the United States has withheld support for China's WTO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	China has restricted imports of agricultural products to protect  
its own markets, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Glickman said 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States wants to see freer markets in China,  
particularly for grains, Glickman said. State control of production 
and price-setting play too large a part in China's farming sector, 
he said in a visit to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Twins Make Movie About Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Filmmaking brothers Michael and Mark Polish  
explored familiar ground in ``Twin Falls Idaho,'' a quirky tale 
about the everyday lives of Siamese twins. 
</P>
<P>
	They're not joined at the hip like the fictional Falls brothers,  
but they are identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers star in the independent film which they co-wrote  
and Michael directed, using a lifetime of experience with the issue 
for reference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big moment for people after they've known us for a  
while,'' Michael says in Sunday's The New York Times, ``when they 
come up and say they can tell us apart. I always find that 
hilarious. Like being identical wasn't good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like we were trying to be identical, and we could only pull it  
off for so long,'' Mark adds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old brothers never had any trouble differentiating  
their respective personalities, noting early on in school that 
Michael had a firmly realistic artistic bent, while Mark's was 
highly expressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see that as more of an acting thing and his as more  
of a directing thing,'' Mark said, waiting in vain for his brother 
to finish the thought before concluding: ``What a perfect person 
we'd be if we were one.''

<HEADLINE> Banned Fish Becomes Hot Item in Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REPUBLIC, Mo. (AP) -- A tiny fish that became a cause celebre in  
this city within a landlocked state has continued reeling in 
national interest. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court ruled this month that the Christian fish symbol  
-- known as an ichthus -- had to be removed from the city's seal 
because it violated the constitutional separation of church and 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	But ever since the ichthus-bearing seal started coming down last  
week, the little fish seems to be more popular than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of people call from all over the country  
asking what we're going to do with this stuff,'' said City 
Administrator Dean P. Thompson as he stood in his office, cluttered 
with fish-adorned lapel pins, buttons, patches, business cards, 
stationery, a clock and other memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The seal also adorned city trucks, signs, flags and letterheads.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a guy call in who said, `I'll give you $100 for the city  
limit sign,''' Thompson continued with a smile. ``A guy from 
Georgia said he collects business cards. He said, `Send me a 
card.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said an Internet auction was a likely possibility, with  
proceeds going toward the estimated $20,000 needed to remove the 
seal from city property. 
</P>
<P>
	Most folks here couldn't help giggling a bit at the 15 minutes  
of fame the fish symbol brought this quiet little suburb located 
just west of Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fish died. You suppose they're going to have a fish fry?''  
quipped Milton King, commander at the local Veterans of Foreign 
Wars hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The fish -- a symbol of Christianity since the time of ancient  
Rome -- won out in a 1990 design contest to create a new city seal 
and flag for Republic, population 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The seal's designer, Marilyn Schexsnayder, said the intention of  
the simple design was for the fish to represent all religions, not 
just Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jean Webb, a practitioner of Wicca, or witchcraft, said when  
she moved to Republic in 1995 the symbol made her feel unwelcome. 
Last year, the Ozarks chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union 
sued on her behalf, seeking to have the ichthus removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Board of Aldermen refused, and called on local residents to  
raise as much as $100,000 to defend the fish. 
</P>
<P>
	When a federal court ruled in the ACLU's favor July 9, the city  
backed down. Aldermen voted last week to can the fish, with Mayor 
Doug Boatright casting the tiebreaker in a 5-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to see that even in southwest Missouri, where the  
church you go to really does matter ... it's nice to see that the 
Constitution can still win out,'' said Ms. Webb, who has since 
moved from Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say the mayor made the right move,'' barber John Parker  
said as he trimmed a customer's hair. ``It's time to get over this 
and get on to something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us here don't think much of the ACLU,'' Parker added  
as a shop full of customers nodded their agreement. ``But the city 
didn't have enough money to fight this, and they were going to have 
to dip into taxpayers' funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have been fine to leave it on there,'' he  
said. ``But if it was going to take a lot of tax money to do it, 
then it just wasn't worth it'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some even agreed with Ms. Webb.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm for the separation of church and state,'' said Dallas  
Combs. ``I don't think the government should get involved in 
anybody's religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, King said, last week's court decision won't alter  
much but the signs at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to change this town any because that little  
logo is not on there,'' he said. ``It's still a nice little town.''

<HEADLINE> Smokers Rolling Own Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- When cigarette prices jumped last fall, Tom  
Hagen figured he had two choices: quit or roll his own. 
</P>
<P>
	He's still puffing. Like thousands of others, he now gets his  
cigarettes the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolling your own -- formerly the exclusive territory of farmers  
and truck drivers -- has suddenly become urban chic, says Adam 
Marsh, president of M&AMP;R Holdings in New York City, which produces 
``Farmers' Gold'' tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see Yuppie types. I saw a young woman in a cafe in the East  
Village who took out a little pouch of tobacco, took out some 
papers and rolled her own,'' Marsh says. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh's company plans to introduce a make-your-own kit later  
this summer with a cigarette machine, tobacco and all the other 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce White, owner of Royal Cigar Co. in Atlanta, says sales of  
make-your-own supplies ``are off the wall.'' Royal Cigar has an 
Internet business that offers 11 rolling machine models ranging 
from $4 to $20 and more than 30 brands of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's anyone from age 30 up to the 90s,'' says Mrs. White. ``I  
had a woman in her 80s call me and say she's rolling. It crosses 
every line I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Stokkebye, whose California-based firm sells several  
European blends through tobacconists, says the practice was all but 
extinct until the multibillion-dollar tobacco settlement drove up 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that within a year or so it'll probably grow to 5  
percent of consumption, and ... that's a lot of tobacco,'' 
Stokkebye says. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. controls 62 percent of the  
cigarette-making kits and loose tobacco that make up the 
roll-your-own market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of loose tobacco are up 30 percent over last year,  
spokesman Mark Smith says. The company expects sales of the tobacco 
and make-your-own accessories to reach $110 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette prices went up 45 cents a pack last year after four  
tobacco makers agreed to pay $206 billion to states for the cost of 
caring for sick smokers. They had previously settled with four 
states for about $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the federal excise tax on cigarettes, now at 24  
cents per pack, will jump 10 cents on Jan. 1 and 5 cents more in 
2002. Some states also levy high taxes on cigarettes, including 
California's 87 cents per pack and Alaska's and Hawaii's $1 per 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, prices for loose tobacco have remained fairly  
stable because the federal government and many states don't tax it. 
In an effort to partially close that loophole, loose tobacco will 
be subject to a 4 cents-per-pound federal excise tax starting in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albany, where a carton of Marlboro costs about $25, a smoker  
would pay about $11 using Brown &AMP; Williamson's kit -- $7.50 for the 
tobacco, $3.00 for tubes and filters and $3.50 for a machine that 
can be reused. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen said his make-your-own cigarettes cost $8 to $9 per  
carton. He gets his supplies from a mail-order business and from 
Joe's Smokehouse, a local tobacco shop. Owner Joe Carter sells more 
than a dozen brands of rolling tobacco, some imported, and several 
cigarette-making machines. He also stocks rolling paper and 
cigarette tubes with filters. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two basic types of machines. One rolls the cigarettes  
on a fabric band. Gummed paper holds the cigarette together. The 
other stuffs the tobacco into the paper tubes that already have the 
filters inserted at one end. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter says he's stocked roll-your-own supplies since his store  
opened in 1996, but has seen higher demand since the tobacco 
settlement. He says his customers come from all walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of them feel the government is trying to force  
them out of smoking and they don't want to be forced,'' Carter 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Hagen, ``I only wish I had started handrolling long ago  
because I have learned to like it.''

<HEADLINE> Robin Yount Thanks Friends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- On Robin Yount's big day, he took time  
to remember three workers killed while building a new ballpark in 
the city where he found baseball greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``As great a day as this is for us up here, we have to remember  
there are people out there who are hurting,'' Yount said Sunday 
during his acceptance speech for his induction into baseball's Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're often reminded as to how quickly things can be taken  
from us. My heart goes out to the families of the men who lost 
their lives in the construction of the new stadium in Milwaukee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 14, a 567-foot crane at Miller Park, what will be the  
Milwaukee Brewers' new stadium, collapsed, killing three workers 
helping to lift a 400-ton section of roof into place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game of life can sometimes be too short,'' Yount said,  
concluding his speech. ``So play it with everything you've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount, the first player to wear a Brewers' cap into the Hall of  
Fame, ranks 15th on the career hits list with 3,142. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent all 20 years with Milwaukee, spurning chances to play  
with better teams, and is one of only three players to win the MVP 
award at two positions (shortstop, 1982; center field, 1989). Yount 
retired in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess, simply Robin, all I can say is on behalf of myself  
and the fans of Milwaukee and Wisconsin it has been an unbelievable 
privilege,'' said former Brewers owner Bud Selig, now commissioner 
of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount a huge crowd that included hooting and clapping Brewers  
fans that, as a boy, he spent hours playing baseball with family 
and friends and dreamed of playing professional ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky. That dream came true,'' Yount said.  
</P>
<P>
	His dreams of hitting a homer in a World Series and playing in  
an All-Star game also came true -- but he also dreamed of making the 
final catch in a World Series and being mobbed by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I guess all my dreams didn't come true,'' Yount said,  
bringing chuckles from the audience. The 1982 Brewers lost to the 
St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``But what I'd really like to tell you is, I never dreamed of  
being in the Hall of Fame. Standing here with all these great 
players was beyond any of my dreams,'' Yount added. ``I couldn't 
have handpicked a better class to go to Cooperstown with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yount was inducted Sunday along with Orlando Cepeda, Nolan Ryan,  
George Brett, late umpire Nestor Chylak, Negro leagues pitcher 
Smokey Joe Williams and turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount also heaped praise on former coaches dating back to his  
little league and high school days. He thanked people from a list 
that was a who's who of Brewers history. 
</P>
<P>
	There was former owner Selig, ``who truly cared about his  
players,'' and former managers, such as Del Crandall, Harvey Kuehn, 
George Bamberger and current manager Phil Garner. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the players, such as Henry Aaron, Paul Molitor,  
Cecil Cooper, Gorman Thomas, Larry Hisle, Rollie Fingers and Jim 
Gantner. The list went on and on. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have guys like this not only as teammates but as friends  
made it where I couldn't wait to go to the ballpark every day,'' 
Yount said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yount even mentioned the Brewers' radio announcer Bob Uecker --  
``not a teammate, but definitely one of the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor, likely to be the next Brewer inducted into the Hall of  
Fame, was on hand for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that he's enjoying it and savoring it and having a  
chance to share with a lot of friends and family,'' Molitor said. 
``I know personally I can never measure how much he meant to my 
career, his friendship and the things that he taught me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Vanderhoef, a fan from Kenosha, Wis., spoke of his trip to  
Cooperstown as of a pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a religious thing. We go to the homeland, or wherever  
Robin Yount is to be honored,'' said Vanderhoef, who was wearing a 
Brewers cap, and sported long red hair and a moustache that made 
him a Yount look-a-like. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig said he was impressed by the fans' dedication.  
</P>
<P>
	``You see all these people with Brewer caps and Brewer jerseys  
and Yount jerseys,'' Selig said. ``There's so many people here from 
Milwaukee and Wisconsin. This is big. This is really big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, now's the time when I'm supposed to wake up from all of  
this,'' Yount said during his speech. ``I mean it's OK, it's been a 
great dream. But if in fact this is reality, then with all due 
respect, Mr. Gehrig, today I consider myself the luckiest man on 
the face of the earth.''

<HEADLINE> 'Haunting' Scares Away Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Haunting'' went bump at the box office  
as the high-tech ghost story premiered at No. 1 with $33 million, 
according to industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another effects-laden movie, ``Inspector Gadget,'' debuted in  
second place with $22 million. ``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' a black 
comedy about teen beauty queens duking it out in middle America, 
opened weakly at 11th place with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' prequel, meanwhile, crossed the $400 million  
mark to become the third-highest grossing movie of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend's top two movies debuted with good numbers despite  
reviews ranging from so-so to downright bad. It was the fourth 
straight No. 1 opening for ``Haunting'' director Jan De Bont, who 
also topped the box office with ``Speed,'' ``Twister'' and ``Speed 
2: Cruise Control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Haunting'' was helped by the increasing draw of stars Liam  
Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Based on a Shirley Jackson story, 
the movie is a remake of a 1963 thriller directed by Robert Wise. 
The remake uses dazzling computer effects to make a haunted house 
come alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an old-fashioned horror movie with a PG-13 rating, and  
you can't underestimate that rating for summertime play,'' said Jim 
Tharp, distribution chief for DreamWorks, which released ``The 
Haunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp said the PG-13 rating should help carry the movie next  
weekend, when horror phenomenon ``The Blair Witch Project'' expands 
from 31 theaters to about 1,000. ``Blair Witch,'' the story of 
three filmmakers who vanish on a witch hunt in the woods, is rated 
R. 
</P>
<P>
	The low-budget ``Blair Witch'' continued to sell out theaters,  
taking in $2 million for an average of about $64,500 a screen, more 
than five times ``The Haunting's'' average. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by good press buzz and a marketing campaign aimed to make  
the film look like a real-life documentary, Artisan Entertainment 
plans a wide release starting Friday. By Aug. 6, the movie could be 
in 1,500 to 2,000 theaters, said Artisan spokesman Paul Pflug. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan held off on wider distribution for ``Blair Witch'' until  
July 30 to avoid clashing with ``The Haunting,'' Pflug said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inspector Gadget'' is a live-action version of the TV cartoon  
starring Matthew Broderick as a detective rebuilt after an 
explosion with all-purpose gizmos and doodads inside him. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, which drew a largely family audience, benefitted from  
a theater slate crowded with more adult-oriented films. 
</P>
<P>
	The gross-out sex comedy ``American Pie'' slipped from second  
place to third, taking in $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kubrick's racy ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' starring Tom Cruise  
and Nicole Kidman, dropped from first place to fourth with $9.9 
million on its second weekend, down 54 percent since its $21.7 
million opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was No. 10 with  
$4.2 million for a total of $402.9 million since its May 19 
release. The ``Star Wars'' prequel edged past ``E.T.: The 
Extra-terrestrial'' into third place for all-time U.S. box office 
in actual dollars, behind ``Titanic'' and the original ``Star 
Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``The Haunting,'' $33 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Inspector Gadget,'' $22 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``American Pie,'' $10.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' $9.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Big Daddy,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Lake Placid,'' $5.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Wild Wild West,'' $5.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``The Wood,'' $4.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Tarzan,'' $4.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $4.2 million.
