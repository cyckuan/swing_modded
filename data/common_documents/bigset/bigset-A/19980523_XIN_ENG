<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The directors of eight financial
organizations have been punished for illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
Demerits were recorded in their work records, and some were
dismissed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, at a
teleconference held here today, called on financial organizations
nationwide to do a good job of financial work, and to strictly
punish those who engage in activities which violate related
regulations and laws.
</P>
<P>
Dai stressed that financial organizations must crack down on
illegal financial activities, such as attracting deposits with
artificially high interest rates, keeping disorderly accounts,
poor cash management, the issuing of long-term credit
certificates, the diversion of state funds into personal accounts
and violation of the foreign currency regulations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that strict punishment for illegal financial
activities and the strengthening of self-monitoring systems will
help the country develop a safe and sound financial order.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Warns Against Reduction of Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday warned that current government efforts to streamline the
Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) should not result in the reduction of
the 40,000-strong force to levels that could deprive the
country of the means to defence itself.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at a passout parade of 65 ZNA officer cadets at the
Zimbabwe Military Academy in Grewu of central Zimbabwe, Mugabe said
these changes should only be designed to match the organizational
requirements with available financial resources, the zimbabwe news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
''The culmination of this policy should, however, never be the
injudicious reduction of our national army to levels that will
deprive us of an adequate capacity to cope with situations that could
arise in future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed that the maintenance of a well-trained and sufficiently
equipped defence force is a prerequisite for an effective defence
deterrent posture against any would-be external aggressors.
</P>
<P>
He commended the officer cadets course for its nature of being
involving and comprehensive as it aimed at building an officer who
exudes confidence, professionalism and integrity.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Capital Market Development in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government and the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Friday jointly organized a seminar
here on the development of the capital market in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Findings of a study on the capital market development in Nepal
were presented at the seminar, the ADB said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Participants were told that the development of the capital
market and that of the private sector as a whole are closely
related, and that reforms are needed in five major areas.
</P>
<P>
The five areas are civil service, tax administration, provision
of powers of enforcement for security regulators, modernization of
the system of law and justice, and allowance of foreign banks and
professional advisors such as securities houses, chartered
accountants and auditors to be established here.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Finance Minister Ram Saran Mahat reviewed the impact of
the initial reforms in Nepal some five years back, and emphasized
the need for continuity in the policy and strategies of economic
development and their effective implementation.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives of privatization underway in Nepal is to
propagate the broader and democratic ownership concept, Mahat
said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shah, ADB's resident representative in Nepal, stressed the
role the private sector has to play in the development of any
country, and the necessity of having a well-functioning and
transparent capital market where the private sector can turn to
for long-term risk barring capital.
</P>
<P>
A round-table discussion was held before the seminar ended.
Participants discussed the need for greater market transparency,
better auditing standard and better disclosure of information,
better corporate governance, and a wider participation in the
capital market, ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The feedback from the participants will be included in the
final report due to be discussed with the Nepali government in
July, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The participants represented various ministries and agencies,
the private sector, professional associations in Nepal and the
donor community.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries Urged to Faciliate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai Friday called on countries in the
southern African region to formulate policies that provide a
conducive enrironment for farmers, traders and processors to do
their business.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a one-day workshop on agricultural industry
stakeholders here, the Zimbabwean minister noted studies that had
been carried out in east Africa and some southern African
countries identified and analysed constraints to formal trade.
</P>
<P>
Informal crossborder trade, Kangai said, was dominated by
agricultural products such as maize, meat, sugar, cooking oil,
investock and other foods.
</P>
<P>
''Differences in formal and informal prices, comparative
advantages that lead to this informal trade and many other trade
related issues have been examined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the common concern in the region was
economic and social development and the immediate focus was the
alleviatiion of poverty which remained widespread in both urban
and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Increased agricultural production and trade in agricultural
products could contribute significantly to not only economic
growth, but to regional food security as well, Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the issues that came under focus at the workshop
include the development of an agricultural directory which will
assist in easily identifying major stakeholders and what they do.
</P>
<P>
An agricultural comparative advantage report on Zimbabwe which
analyzed the country's competitiveness in the production and
trading of agricultural produce to assist the region to develop
sustainable food security policies was also discussed.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Conservative Party Calls for Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Christian Social Union (CSU), the
Bavarian sister party of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), Friday urged tightening up of the
country's asylum rules to stem the inflows of foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is not an immigration nation," argued the CSU in a
policy paper adopted at a party congress in the southern German
city of Ingolstadt.
</P>
<P>
The Bavaria-based conservative party Friday also reiterated its
rejection to granting dual citizenship to foreigners living in
Germany and called for swift deportation of those foreigners who
have committed serious crimes in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Bavaria and Germany have reached the limit of ability to take
in foreign immigrants," argued Munich CSU leader, Peter Gauweiler.
"Man cannot embrace the whole world while neglecting its own
people," he added.
</P>
<P>
The hardline demand of the CSU, however, triggered sharp
criticism from opposition parties as well as the Free Democratic
Party (FDP), which is the junior partner in Kohl's center-right
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The FDP has been pressing for a more liberal policy to make it
earlier for the nation's 7 million foreigners to integrate into
German society.

<HEADLINE> China Denies Allegation of US Missile Technology Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A veteran Chinese expert on carrier
rocket technology today denied that a US satellite company helped
China to improve its missile guidance and control system during
the investigation of the launching failure of China's Long March
rocket in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Li Jianzhong, president of the
China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, accused some people
and media organizations in the United State of spreading
groundless fabrications.
</P>
<P>
As an expert who experienced the whole investigation process of
the launching failure, Li said that China invited six experts from
the United States, Britain and Germany to form an assessment
group in line with the international practice.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the investigation was to obtain reference for
the insurance sector and clients to make decisions, he said,
adding that the action was irreproachable.
</P>
<P>
China has, in the past three decades, developed space technology
by relying entirely on itself, and made remarkable achievements in
this field, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China has never expected to obtain technology from
other countries by entering the international rocket launching
market.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he stressed, China had found out the cause of the
launch failure and taken proper improvement measures even before
it formed the assessment group.
</P>
<P>
The two cases of successful launching of the Long March 3B last
year were achieved by China itself, without help from the US
satellite company, Li noted.

<HEADLINE> Missile Great Wall Corp. Refutes Claims of US Role in China Missile Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- "Some US citizens and media
purposely fabricated the story about US satellite manufacturers
exposing missile technology to China. There was no such thing,"
said Liu Zhixiong, vice-president of the China Great Wall Industry
Corporation, today.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remark at a press conference sponsored by the
corporation in response to stories recently disseminated by some
US media and citizens, which claimed that US satellite
manufacturers had helped China to improve its missile guidance and
control systems during the investigation of the Long March launch
vehicle failure which took place February 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It is ridiculous and irresponsible for these stories to be
elaborated one after the other, until there is even talk
of 'endangering national security'," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
A failure analysis panel composed of experts from the Chinese
aerospace industry had already pinpointed the failure before the
participation of the Independent Review Committee (IRC). The
latter was set up at the request of the international insurance
underwriters, who insisted that an analysis team made up of
scientists and engineers from various countries be formed to
review the investigation findings, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The function of the IRC was to review the failure
investigation findings, and had no responsibility to help the
Chinese side to resolve any kind of technical problems. Nor did it
do so. This was a totally normal and commercial practice," he
emphasized, adding that the action taken by the US government to
detain the IRC's report upset the international insurance
community.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the setting up of the IRC, its composition
and its activities were all completely open. The two US
corporations involved -- Space System/Loral and Hughes Space and
Communications -- were involved because they had direct and purely
commercial business relations.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the INTELSAT 708 satellite, the contracted
Mabuhay Agila satellite and the contracted APStar 2R satellite
were all manufactured by Space Systems/Loral, while the contracted
APStar 1A and ChinaSat 7 satellites were made by Hughes Space and
Communications, he added.

NICOSIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has said it
was satisfied with the U.N. Security Council's rejection of
Turkish Cypriots' demand to change the bi-communal talks into a
state-to-state negotiation.

"The position of the U.N. Security Council, which insists on

Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the island
under a bi-zonal and bi-communal formula.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Turkish Cypriots walked out of the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks to protest the European Union's (EU's)
decision to start accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has since insisted on recognition of his breakaway
state before negotiations can be resumed, and on the withdrawal of
Cyprus' application for the EU membership.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Friday called for concerted international
action to ensure child protection in Sierra Leone where atrocity
has been escalating.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 Sierra Leone civilians, including women and children,
have been tortured by remnants of the ousted Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council and the rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front in the past two weeks, UNICEF said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency quoted latest news reports as saying that
civilians have been tortured and mutilated, some suffering from
amputations of their hands, ears, breasts and genitals.
</P>
<P>
The democratically-elected government in the 4.5 million
population the West African country returned to power in March
after six months in exile, but the rebels are still operating in
some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"In almost all conflict zones, the world is daily confronted
with unspeakable violations of the rights of children," UNICEF
Director-General Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Leone, over 55 percent of children aged 6-14 are out
of school, according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy called on donors to respond generously to flash U.N.
aid appeal totaling 4 million U.S. dollars for Sierra Leone for
the period March-May 1998. So far only one fifth of the request
has been fulfilled.

NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 passengers
were killed and hundreds injured in a tragic train accident
Friday morning in Malawi's southern Thyolo District, about 40 Km
east of commercial city of Blantyre.
</P>
<P>
The train which left Blantyre's Limbe station at 5 a.m.

casualties retrieved when Malawi railways official and medical
personnel arrived at the scene at about 10 a.m., reported the Malawi
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Some eye witnesses said about 100 casualties were taken to
Blantyre's Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital by 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
However, some sources said the train was overloaded and that
the engine was not fit to travel as it had a mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
The number of dead bodies is expected to rise as many bodies
were still trapped beneath the wagons as efforts to retrieve them

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani on U.S. Failure to Isolate Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said Friday that the U.S. retreat from sanctions on
Iran was a major victory for the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
"The recent U.S. measures for partial abrogation of sanctions
on Iran is not only a clear retraction of illogical
extra-territorial laws, but also a major victory for the Iranian
nation," Rafsanjani said at a Friday prayer congregation.
</P>
<P>
Calling the D'Amato and Helmz-Burton laws as an indication of
the U.S. domineering policy, Rafsanjani said that, by taking such
measures unilaterally, U.S. was like taking a big bite that it was
incapable of swallowing, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Tuesday that Washington
decided not to impose sanctions on the French, Russian and
Malaysian companies which have had a contract totaling 2 billion
U.S. dollars with Iran to tap an Iranian offshore gas field in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
According to the D'Amato law signed by Clinton in 1996,
Washington would punish any company which has more than 40 million
U.S. dollars in investments in the energy sector of Iran and
Libya. The ceiling was reduced to 20 million dollars last August.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. retreat was also believed by Tehran as a failure of
Washington's efforts to isolate Tehran through accusations that
Iran was undermining the Middle East peace process, seeking
nuclear weapons and supporting terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Leaks Trigger Outcries in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The recent revelations of radioactive
contaminations of German nuclear waste convoys have triggered a
wave of outcries in Germany with the parliament planning to hold a
special session next week to clarify the government's role in the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
At issue is a recent finding that many nuclear waste containers
shipped from Germany to French reprocessing plants had excess
outside radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
The German authorities also revealed earlier this month that
there had been 11 cases of excess radioactivity on German waste
convoys in 1997 out of a total of 55 convoys.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bonn has ordered the suspension of all nuclear
waste shipments both within the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace and German opposition parties however accused
the government of having been informed of the contaminations
several years ago but having failed to stop the shipments earlier.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the charge, the Environment Ministry said that it was
informed of the problem by the French side for the first time at
the end of April. Moreover, no contaminations had been reported in
Germany so far.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also sharply criticized the atomic industry after
the latter admitted that they had been informed of the excess
radioactivity as early as the mid-1980s but had not asked the
government for help.
</P>
<P>
The latest revelations also provoked strong protests from the
German police which have to deploy large troops every year to
protect inland transport of nuclear wastes amid widespread
anti-nuclear protests.
</P>
<P>
German Environment Minister Angela Merkel insisted Friday that
the government had not done anything wrong. She also welcomed the
parliament debate scheduled for next week, saying that it would
help to clarify the whole issue.

<HEADLINE> Chadian Southern Rebels Surrender to Gov't Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chadian rebels fighting for a federal
state in the southern part of the country have surrendered to
government forces after six months of fighting, according to
reports from Chad.
</P>
<P>
The Forces Armees pour la Republic Federale (FARF), a
political-military group which has hundreds of desert fighters,
signed on May 8 with President Idris Deby a truce in exchange for
an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
FARF leader Laokein Barde has reportedly fled the country.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, mostly civilians, have been killed during
the fighting between the FARF and government forces, which were
reportedly supported by France.
</P>
<P>
Fighting began on October 30, 1997, when the government forces
tried to dispel the FARF from the southern city of Moundou.
</P>
<P>
The special force "nomad guards," trained by French troops from
1994 to 1996, brutally suppressed the villagers in the war zone
and mainly targeted civilians for extortions, said reports.
</P>
<P>
The conflict was the last episode of the north-south fighting
in Chad which has marked the history of the Sahel nation ever
since its independence from France in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The southerners called for the establishment of a federal
state, which would allow them, mostly Christians and animists, to
escape the hegemony of northerners, mostly Muslims, who have
dominated the country since the victory of President Hissene Habre
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The end of the conflict in the southern part of Chad will allow
the government to start oil explorations in the region, reportedly
rich in petroleum deposits, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
France has been maintaining about 1,000 soldiers in Chad under
a military agreement as well as an air force squadron deployed in
the 1980s under the Epervier operation aimed at fending off Libyan
invasion.
</P>
<P>
A small number of French troops stayed in the southern part of
Chad throughout the six-month conflict to train government
soldiers engaging the FARF fighters.
</P>
<P>
Paris is blamed by local villagers for ignoring open violence
inflicted upon civilians by government forces.

<HEADLINE> Referendum Turnout for Northern Irish Peace High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chief Electoral Officer in Northern
Ireland Pat Bradley said Friday that turnout in the referendum on
the peace agreement was a record high.
</P>
<P>
"It's been very consistent and persistent, and that would seem
to indicate a high turnout if it continues at this level," Bradley
said in an interview on BBC Ulster.
</P>
<P>
"If it's a high poll, clearly there are more ballot papers to
be counted. But I am hopeful that we could have a result early to
mid-afternoon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bradley said voters had cast ballots steadily throughout the
day, which was unusual.
</P>
<P>
In some areas of the province, including Belfast and Lurgan,
queues formed outside polling stations before they open at 7:00 in
the morning. Voting has also been brisk in the Irish Republic,
according to a BBC report from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the biggest Protestant party in
Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionists, said voting was running at
a higher level than usual. "That confirms a general expectation

</P>
<P>
The peace deal sets out new arrangements for the internal
administration of Northern Ireland and for new cross-border bodies
designed to improve cooperation between the north and south of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for changes to the Irish constitution which
alters the republic's claim to Northern Ireland so that it talks
of uniting people rather than territory.
</P>
<P>
Security forces have been on alert throughout the day to guard
against possible attacks by militants on both sides, but so far
there have been no reported incidents or injuries in the voting.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will be closed at 10:00 pm. Counting begins at
9:00 am Saturday and final results are expected to come out in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia Needs START-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry Friday
said that Russia needs ratification of the START-2 (strategic
arms reduction treaty) more than the United States does.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Vladimir Rahmanin, the Foreign
Ministry's spokesman, as saying that ratification of START-2 is "a
crucial issue from the point of view of Russia's security."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a roundtable meeting on the country's geopolitical
priorities at the end of the century, Rahmanin said Russia cannot
afford to maintain a large quantity of missiles and their number
needs to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
A START-3 is necessary for this purpose, which is impossible
without START-2, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The START-2 treaty signed by the United States and Russia in
Moscow in January 1993 was ratified by the U.S. congress in
January 1996. The ratification of the START-2 treaty has been
obstructed by the State Duma.

<HEADLINE> France to Extradite Basque Militant to Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- France will extradite a militant of
the Basque independence movement ETA to Spain after she has
finished her prison term in France.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government of Pas-de-Calais in northern France
made the decision to extradite Idoia Lopez Riano, nicknamed
Tigress, wanted by the Spanish authorities for suspected
involvement in 23 assassinations, most of them committed in 1986
in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
She was arrested in 1994 in southern France and condemned to
five years in prison in 1996 for associations with criminals and
illegally bearing arms prohibited in France.
</P>
<P>
But her prison sentence was shortened and she was originally
due to be released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A committee in charge of extradition in Pas-de-Calais
considered the presence of Tigress in France "a threat" to public
security because of her violent behaviors.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government of France has promised Spain that it
will fully cooperate in fighting ETA militants taking shelter in
France, especially its southwest Basque region bordering Spain.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Condemns Armed Attack in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations Friday strongly condemned the recent armed attack
in Angola against personnel from the United Nations and the
Angolan National Police.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, a patrol of U.N. personnel and the Angolan National
Police was attacked by armed elements, in which one person was
killed and three people were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council demanded that
the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation of Angola
(GURN) and in particular the Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) guarantee unconditionally the safety and freedom of
movement of all United Nations and other international personnel.
</P>
<P>
The council strongly deplored the failure by the UNITA to
complete the implementation of its remaining obligations under the
Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions,
especially its failure to cooperate in completing the
normalization of state administration throughout the national
territory.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the GURN and UNITA in the strongest terms
to refrain from any action which may lead to renewed hostilities
or derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The council warned that if the UNITA fails to fulfill its
obligations in accordance with the Lusaka Protocol, it will
consider the imposition of additional measures on the UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges EU Members Not to Send Wrong Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece urged Friday the European
Union (EU) members not to send wrong messages to Turkey to hurt
Greece's interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his talks with Britain's special envoy for the
Cyprus problem, Sir David Hannay, Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis said that EU members should in future refrain
from sending out wrong messages to Turkey by isolating Greece,
such as in their recent decision to convene the union's
association council with Turkey, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that the strengthening of Turkey's European
orientation was its own responsibility which that country was
being called upon to assume itself.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that the EU must defend the decisions
adopted at December's Luxembourg summit concerning the principles
and criteria for an improvement in the relations between Greece
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
While describing his visit to Greece as "extremely important,"
Hannay, who arrived here Friday for talks with Greek officials,
reportedly told the Greek side that although the British
government was not prepared to endorse a revision of Luxembourg
summit decisions, it considered that there was perhaps need to
discuss certain "clarifications" in Cardiff, Britain, but without
changing the substance of issues.
</P>
<P>
Hannay said that he would visit a number of European countries
to discuss the issues regarding the Euro-Turkish relations, and
then report British Prime Minister Tony Blair ahead of the Cardiff
summit on June 15.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Kranidiotis and Hannay discussed Cyprus'
accession to the EU, the visit by British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook to Turkey, Turkey's decision not to attend the association
council and London's positions in view of the Cardiff summit.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) U.S. Senate Votes Sanctions on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted 90 to 4
Friday to impose sanctions on Russia for exporting missile
technology to Iran, but it was expected to be vetoed by President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The measure was passed by the House of Representatives last
November, but with slight differences. The two chambers will
resolve the differences of the versions of the measure before
sending it to the president.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, sanctions include denying arms export licenses
and eliminating all U.S. assistance for two years. The bill allows
the president to waive sanctions for reasons of national security.
</P>
<P>
The administration would be required to report to Congress the
companies or research institutes that have transferred or sought
to transfer missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the legislation accused that Russia had been
helping Iran refine the delivery system of its missiles and that
"numerous Russian entities" had provided other assistance,
including wind tunnels for missile development.
</P>
<P>
The Senate agreed that the sanctions would be applied only on
cases of aid to Iran's missile program after January 1998 when
Russia took steps to control its exports of dual-use technology.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's missile program has been advanced tremendously by
assistance from a wide range of Russian entities," Senate
Republican Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said in explaining his
vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the Clinton administration told Congress this week
that Russia had made progress in controlling exports of missile
technology and needed more time to put a tough nuclear
non-proliferation policy in place.
</P>
<P>
The White House renewed a veto threat. Enactment of the bill
"would weaken the United States' ability to persuade the
international community to halt such transfers to Iran," said a
White House statement released Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lumberman Gets U.N. Environmental Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- An 84-year-old lumberman, who has
planted thousands of trees in northeastern China to "pay back his
debt to nature," has won the 1998 U.N. environmental award, the
U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 individuals and organizations from 19 countries
are to receive the U.N. Global 500 Roll award at World
Environment Day celebrations in Moscow on June 5, said UNEP chief
Klaus Topfer.
</P>
<P>
Yongshun Ma, living in densely forested Heilongjiang Province,
had cut down hundreds of thousands of trees during his 21-year
career as a lumberman before retiring in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the mounting environmental degradation around, Ma
felt guilty and reproached his overlogging. Therefore, he
decided to devote his remaining life to environmental protection
by planting 36,500 trees as "atonement".
</P>
<P>
In 1991, when he turned 78 and there were some 1,000 trees
left to meet the target, Ma convinced all of his family -- 16
people spanning three generations -- to plant trees on holidays.
At the end of that spring, all his "debt" was paid finally.
</P>
<P>
However, Ma has been continuing his new life. By 1996, he had
planted 40,000 trees and built a high-qualified breeding base for
trees.
</P>
<P>
Motivated by Ma's action, more and more people in the region
are planting trees and the forest there is expanding at a record
speed.
</P>
<P>
Ma has also taught a lot of people how to breed and plant
trees successfully. Tree planting efforts under his guidance win
a success rate of 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ma, together with other U.N. environmental award winners, sets
up example which "will inspire and guide many other men, women
and young people to join the global coalition dedicated to
protecting the environment," said Topfer.
</P>
<P>
Some 664 individuals and organizations, in both the adult and
youth categories, have been honored since UNEP launched the
Global 500 award in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Cause Floods in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Floods caused by continual heavy
rains in Turkey's western Black Sea region have cut off power and
telephone lines, swept away roads and damaged buildings, virtually
paralyzing these areas.
</P>
<P>
There is so far no report of casualties, mainly because of the
disruption of communications with the area. The main road to
Zonguldak province from the capital Ankara, some 300 kilometers in
length, was ruined by fast-running river water that overflowed.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government, non-governmental organizations and the
armed forces have been mobilized to provide urgent aids to the
flood-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said the state would mobilize all
its resources to help the victims, adding that a "crisis center"
had been set up in Ankara in order to track the disaster more
closely and to provide solutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 100 people in Karabuk, a city some 200
kilometers northwest of Ankara, were still under siege.
</P>
<P>
Zonguldak Deputy Governor Ahmet Set said that some 100 people
stranded in Zonguldak and its surroundings have been rescued by
helicopters and boats.
</P>
<P>
He said the floods in the districts of Eregli, Alapli, Caycuma,
Gokcebey and Devrek had inflicted heavy damages to local residents.
</P>
<P>
The amount of rainfall in Turkey in last 20 days has already
tripled the average in many previous springs, the country's
Meteorology Directorate said, adding the rain in the Black Sea
region will continue until Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A country music expert Friday
won Senate approval to head the National Endowment for the Arts
(NEA).
</P>
<P>
William J. Ivey, 53, has been director of the Country Music
Foundation in Nashville, Tennessee, since 1971.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said he was delighted with the Senate
approval.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ivey possesses a deep understanding of and commitment to
American creativity," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The NEA has long been a target of conservative critics. Last
year, House Republicans tried to cut off funds for the NEA but
failed and instead reduced its appropriation. The Republican
leadership has promised conservative Christian groups another
attempt at a cut this year.
</P>
<P>
Ivey, a guitarist as well as a college teacher, was in a
fund-raising drive to put up a new building for the Country Music
Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville when the president named him
to the new job. He had served on 15 panels dealing with NEA
grants. A former chairman of the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences, he is recognized as a leader in preserving
historic records of classical as well as popular music, the NEA
said.
</P>
<P>
Ivey is expected to be sworn in next week. He succeeds Jane
Alexander, who resigned from the NEA to return to the stage.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Pakistan Discuss Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Friday expressed concern about India's nuclear tests and urged
Pakistan to exercise patience and self-restraint over the issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a telephone conversation with Pakistani
Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, the Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have always condemned any nuclear test and we are against
proliferation of the nuclear weapons," Khatami was quoted as
saying, "we regard your security as a serious issue, and we fully
understand the circumstances that Pakistani government and people
are undergoing."
</P>
<P>
He said continued nuclear arms race would further deepen
regional crisis and cause environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Sharif accused India of threatening regional peace and security
by detonating nuclear tests, and said Pakistan had refrained from
doing so though it had had the capability, for fear of triggering
regional crisis and an arms race.
</P>
<P>
He said "we are still reviewing the consequences of the nuclear
tests and we have always believed in making wise decisions and
being prudent at such sensitive circumstances."
</P>
<P>
India conducted five underground nuclear tests last week,
triggering off a storm of worldwide condemnations.
</P>
<P>
Some Pakistani officials have warned that Islamabad is under
great pressure from within the country and would explode its own
nuclear devices in the near future in response.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Parliament Reopens on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three months after the
military junta was driven out of the capital Freetown, the
restored President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah reopened the parliament
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his address in the chamber of the parliament, he focused in
particular on the security situation, according to a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Brig.-Gen. Maxwell Kobe, the task force commander of the west
African peacekeeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone, is to develop
guidelines for putting together a new national army for the
country, the president told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to Kabbah, Nigeria's head of state General Sani
Abacha has agreed to make Kobe, a Nigerian general who led the
battle to chase the junta out of Freetown, available to Sierra
Leone for the reestablishment of the national army.
</P>
<P>
It will be ensured that the Sierra Leonean defense system will
be manned by competent and disciplinary people who see the
military as a noble profession and not a means to achieve their
selfish objectives, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Some junior officers, reportedly disgruntled with their poor
treatment, launched a coup last May that overthrew the legitimate
government of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, aided by the international community ousted the junta
in mid-February this year and paved the way for the reinstatement
of Kabbah a month later.
</P>
<P>
Not long after his restoration, the president mandated the
ECOMOG commander to take charge of the security all over Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the president told the parliament that the
past thing in the national security could never happen again.
</P>
<P>
That is "because the government is to create a superior
nationwide intelligence system that will provide full and
accurate information on the security situation in the country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also reminded Sierra Leoneans that the national
economy is so far on an unprecedented downturn in performance
because of the destruction in production and basic
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
While the government is expecting some progress in some areas
with international support, the president pointed out that Sierra
Leone can go ahead economically and socially only by the efforts
of Sierra Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
He also told the parliament that the government will be
introducing a new law for the establishment of an independent
income tax authority.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Protection Against Bio Weapons, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday announced plans to stockpile vaccines and antibiotics for
treatment of Americans in a biological weapons attack and to
protect against cyberspace attack.
</P>
<P>
"If our children are to grow up safe and free, we must approach
these new 21st century threats with the same rigor and
determination we applied to the toughest security challenges of
this century," the president said in a commencement speech at the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Mariland.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the 21st century, our foes have extended the
fields of battle from physical space to cyberspace, from the
world's vast bodies of water to the complex workings of our own
human body. Rather than invading our beaches or launching bombers,
these adversaries may attempt cyber attacks against our critical
military systems and our economic base," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the development and stockpiling of vaccines and
antibiotics for civilians, and directed that public health and
medical surveillance systems be upgraded to detect and sound the
alarm on any release of bacteria or viruses.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said the United State will launch a comprehensive
plan to detect, deter, and defend against attacks on the nation's
critical infrastructures such as computers that control the stock
market, banking, utilities, and air traffic.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to take strong action, then terrorists, criminals
and hostile regimes could invade and paralyze these vital systems,
disrupting commerce, threatening health, weakening our capacity to
function in a crisis," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He appointed National Security Council adviser Richard Clarke,
who specializes in such issues as drug trafficking and terrorism,
to head a new commission on infrastructure protection and
counter-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On the same day the Defense Department expanded its vaccination
program against the lethal anthrax bacteria to include not just
troops in the Gulf region, but all active and reserve personnel.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Pentagon designated 10 states -- Massachusetts, New
York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Missouri, Colorado,
California and Washington -- where National Guard units will be
specially trained for responding to weapons of mass destruction.

WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara
at the State Department Friday on the deadlocked Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Their talks were expected to cover both Israel's withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
war, and Israel's proposal for conditional withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 but
the negotiations broke off in early 1996 without making tangible
progress on two major issues -- the fate of the Golan Heights and
future ties between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
No talks have been held since right-wing Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu won an election in May 1996 and took office as the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the talks to resume from the point where they left
off, but Netanyahu, who opposes returning the Golan Heights to
Syria, wants to start talks anew.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Lebanon, both Damascus and Beirut rejected
Israel's proposal for conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria ad Lebanon say Israel should implement U.N. Resolution
425, passed in 1978, which calls for an unconditional pullback of
Israel's 35,000 troops.

provision alone would not be sufficient to ensure the promotion
and protection of citizens' human rights.
</P>
<P>
Closing the five-day international conference on the
establishment of the human rights commission and the office of
the ombudsman, Meles said the availability of the appropriate
institutional framework for effective implementation of
constitutional provisions guaranteeing political and civil rights
is the key for progress.
</P>
<P>
"There is today a growing realization internationally, and a
consensus within the international community, that the effective
promotion and protection of human rights demands that all aspects
of human life and human needs be taken into account in our effort
to promote the rights of the human person," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no better substitute for protecting the human
rights of citizens than their own active, popular and grassroots
participation in politics and their preparedness to expose and
challenge violations and constitutional transgressions.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his confidence that the
conference has afforded the opportunity to draw lessons on the
approach.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Alternatives Bring Pagers Back to Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- PanAmSat, the U.S. company whose
major satellite shifted out of position Tuesday, said today that
satellite service has been restored its paging and other
telecommunications customers.
</P>
<P>
But it added that it may be a few days before all beepers and
other communication devices are working again.
</P>
<P>
The company shifted service to other satellites after
concluding that it would not try to fix its crippled Galaxy IV
satellite, which malfunctioned Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Paging companies, business networks and radio and TV stations
dependent on the old satellite must adjust their antennas toward
the substitute satellite, Galaxy 3R.
</P>
<P>
The 250-million-dollar Galaxy IV rotated out of its proper
position Tuesday when an onboard computer control system failed,
knocking out service to about 45 million pagers across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The company moved Galaxy IV into a higher orbit Thursday night
and does not plan to restore its communication services, Marcus
said this morning. A replacement satellite will be launched at the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday afternoon, almost 90 percent of the affected
pagers were back in operation, according to a paging industry
trade group.
</P>
<P>
PanAmSat has not determined what caused the computer system to
fail. Officials said there was no evidence that sabotage was
involved or that the satellite was hit by something in space.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Greek Speaker's Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Friday dismissed as
"baseless" recent allegations made by Greek Parliament Speaker
Apostholos Kaklamanis over the killing of Pontus Greeks 79 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry Friday said that
"Kaklamanis' remarks are completely baseless. The historically
incorrect claims about massacre of Pontus Greeks have been
fabricated in order to charge Turkey with baseless accusations".
</P>
<P>
"We regret the fact that such baseless remarks were delivered
by the Greek parliament speaker. We condemn his statements which
serve nothing but to fan hostility against Turkey," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Kaklamanis has accused Turkey of carrying out an ethnic
cleansing campaign against Pontus Greeks living in the country's
Black Sea region in 1919.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over control of the Aegean's
airspace, waters, mineral rights and the divided island of
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Cancels Visit to U.S. Embassy Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich will
start his trip to Israel on Saturday but will cancel a planned
stop at the site of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem because
of controversy about that, a spokesman for Gingrich said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"At the request of the Clinton administration, Speaker
Gingrich will not be visiting the Jerusalem embassy site,"
Andrew Weinstein told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Jerusalem Post reported that Palestinian peace
negotiator Saeb Erekat described Gingrich's visit as "playing
with fire" and could trigger bloodshed by meddling in
Israeli-Palestinian dispute over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, with a congressional delegation, will arrive in
Israel on Saturday for a four-day visit during which he will
meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He then will visit Jordan and meet with King Hussein before
flying to Rome for an audience with Pope John Paul. He will also
visit U.S. troops in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Dismisses Lawsuit over 1992 Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals on Friday dismissed a lawsuit that claimed President Bill
Clinton's 1992 election campaign illegally received 1.4 million
dollars in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
In a 3-0 decision, the court upheld a lower court's dismissal
of the case on grounds that those who brought it did not have
standing, saying they failed to show that they "suffered a
concrete and personalized injury."
</P>
<P>
Nor did they establish a claim that their support for Clinton's
rivals was made less effective because Clinton's campaign received
greater funds with which to sway voters.
</P>
<P>
Judge A. Raymond Randolph described that argument as
"hypothetical." Even if the Clinton campaign received money to
which it was not entitled, it might have spent that money on
brightening its offices or better hotel accommodations, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the panel ruled, extra money did not undercut the
ability of those who brought the suit to support Clinton rivals.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations that sued could not claim to have been
disadvantaged as a competitor to Clinton, the court said. Only a
rival candidate could make that claim. And the four voters' claim
that their ability to influence the election's outcome was
undercut was "far too fanciful," the judges ruled.
</P>
<P>
Since it ruled that those who brought the suit lacked legal
status to bring the case, the court did not address the suit's
claim that the Clinton campaign improperly diverted to the general
election certain funds that, by law, could be used only for a
primary campaign.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Unity, Peace of All African Peoples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Friday called on African peoples to rededicate themselves to
unity, solidarity, peace, harmony and the integrity of all
peoples.
</P>
<P>
The call came from a message by the OAU Secretary-General on
the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the OAU which falls on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
Salim described the 35th anniversary of OAU as "an important
milestone" and noted that "this is a particular stage in its
history that underlines the strong will of its member states to
continue forging a common destiny through their organization."
</P>
<P>
Salim said that "among the major preoccupations within our
collective agenda in the past year has been the pursuit of peace,
security and stability in the region," stressing that "no serious
socio-economic development can be achieved in our countries in
the absence of peace."
</P>
<P>
Summing up the past year's experience, Salim said Africans
"have achieved remarkable success in reducing the areas that are
afflicted by the scourge of conflict".
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, "peace has come to Liberia, the end of
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of
Congo and also in the Central African Republic gives cause for
hope and optimism:, Rwanda is forging ahead "in the process of
rebuilding the structures and institutions for national
development," and Sierra Leone "has achieved significant and
historic achievement of the restoration of constitutional order."
</P>
<P>
Salim stressed that Africans have also made "remarkable
strides" in economic integration, saying that the first assembly
of heads of state and government of African Economic Community
(AEC) held last year during the 33rd OAU summit in Harare,
Zimbabwe "marked a concrete realization of the 1991 Abuja treaty
that laid out a blue-print for the establishment of the African
Economic Community."
</P>
<P>
With the protocol between the AEC and the regional economic
communities signed in February, this year "opened the way for
enhanced cooperation between the community and the regional
groupings of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), in a dynamic
partnership," he adds.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the situation we face today is very
challenging," Salim pointed out, and he noted that "we are also
confident that if we apply ourselves seriously and raise our
determination, we will be able to transform the continent and
overcome the difficulties that we encounter in improving the
conditions of our people."
</P>
<P>
"The accelerated development of the continent as well as its
peace and security depends on collaborative effort between our
governments and peoples in a partnership that is solid and
durable," Salim said, adding that "Africa will certainly have
more chance in addressing its problems when our people work
together in unity, in strength, and in solidarity."

<HEADLINE> Prices Firm As Tobacco Sales Resume in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco prices surged on
the main tobacco sales floor auction when farmers started selling
Friday reaching a high of 1.64 U.S. Dollars per kg, an
appreciable increase from the 1.25 U.S. Dollars per kg average
price when farmers suspended deliveries last week.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Robert Webb said
Friday that "We expect the floors to be much more busy after the
weekend holiday, and we hope prices will continue firming."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the association called on all tobacco growers to
immediately resume full scale deliveries as prices were expected
to firm, after wide and full range discussions with international
merchants and manufacturers over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Last week farmers suspended the sale of tobacco to the auction
floors, protesting against depressed prices, averaging around one
U.S. Dollar per kg, thereby threatening the viability of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco, the country's biggest foreign currency earner,
clinched exports estimated at over 400 million U.S. Dollars this
year.

<HEADLINE> More Southern Sudanese Need Food Aid: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) said
Friday that the number of southern Sudanese facing famine has
risen to 930,000 from originally targeted 700,000.
</P>
<P>
In Bahr El Ghazal Province alone, some 595,000 people need
international food aid, of whom 380,000 are in critical need for
survival, said the WFP Nairobi office. The total figure
represented a 40-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
On March 31, the Khartoum government has granted the U.N. aid
access to Bahr El Ghazal which had been off-limits for nearly two
months. The worsening condition of the people there has prompted
a major emergency intervention.
</P>
<P>
Although the WFP raised its monthly deliveries of food from
2,267 tons in April to an expected 4,000 tons in May, it is still
not enough to meet the emergency food needs of the southern
Sudanese, the U.N. food agency said.
</P>
<P>
WFP said that it is expecting to match the monthly requirement
of 6,500 tons per month for Bahr El Ghazal and other areas of
southern Sudan from the beginning of next month with the arrival
of the fifth Hercules plane.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency appealed for a total of 65.8 million
U.S. Dollars to fund aircraft and food supplies over the next 12
months to keep emergency operations in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has received 15.4 million U.S. Dollars in confirmed
contributions.

<HEADLINE> 8,500 Vietnamese Fall Victim to HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- 8,500 Vietnamese were found to be
infected with the HIV virus, a virus which is responsible for
AIDS, the Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual number of HIV-infected people is six to ten
times higher than the number of cases detected, the
English-language daily added.
</P>
<P>
Of those affected, 90 percent are under 30 and adolescents
account for five percent.
</P>
<P>
Free-lance, jobless people, street children, prostitutes and
drug users are listed as high risk aids infected groups, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
It is also extremely difficult to provide them with the
necessary information about the virus in order to raise their
awareness of the disease.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide year-long campaign was launched on Friday by the
joint United Nations program on HIV AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
The campaign hopes to attract more young people and to inform
them on HIV prevention and care efforts, to enhance their
awareness of the devastating impact of HIV on youth, and to
promote support for young people in their fight against AIDS.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Voters Endorse Peace Deal with Resounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Voters in Northern Ireland endorsed
the historic peace agreement with a resounding majority of 71
percent, official results showed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chief electoral officer Pat Bradley, who was running the voting
on Friday, announced the final result in Belfast with cheers and
chanting from the supporters of the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to Bradley, turnout in Northern Ireland was also a
record high, with 81.1 percent of eligible voters casting their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Final results from the Irish Republic were yet to be announced
but partial official returns suggested a massive 95 percent
majority in the republic voted in favor of the agreement that was
thrashed out last month after 22-month hard negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly four million people -- some 1.2 million in Northern
Ireland and about 2.8 million in the Irish Republic -- were
eligible to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
Observers had said a 70 percent "Yes" vote in Northern Ireland
would indicate that most Protestants, who were split over the
agreement, had voted in favor.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement proposes maintaining Northern Ireland's
links with Britain while building closer ties with Ireland in a
bid to end a catalogue of bombs, bullets and beatings.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam
told reporters at a news conference in Belfast that the province
had "voted to take the gun out of politics, north and south of the
border."
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is supported across the whole community and in
a majority of both (Protestant and Catholic) communities," she
said.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the biggest Protestant party, also
hailed the endorsement of the deal, saying: "It is an endorsement
of what we did on the negotiations and it is a very welcome
acceptance by people."
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, leader of Irish Republic Army's political wing
Sinn Fein which wants a united Ireland, said people had taken a
great leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
"What the electorate did was to sign up for a future, not a
past", he told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was approved in the referendum, Northern
Ireland will quickly move to elections in June for the 108-strong
assembly to govern local affairs.
</P>
<P>
It will not have any powers until next year but will press
ahead with arrangements for the cross-border bodies with the south
of the island.

<HEADLINE> Women in Nepali Village Prefer More Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- In the present age of family
planning, women in the village of Bharatipur in Nawalparasi
district of western Nepal still prefer to give birth to more than
10 children, the government-owned Gorkhapatra daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to bear more than 10 children are subject to
being boycotted from the society, the Nepali-language newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The village, inhabited mainly by the ethnic communities, has
followed the tradition for a long time, villagers said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 2,500, the village has difficult access to
the outside world due to lack of transportation means. It takes
the villagers three days to reach the nearby highway on foot.
</P>
<P>
Usually, women there get married at an early age, and by the
time they reach 32, they have borne 10 children, which they think
is the gift of God.
</P>
<P>
"We should accept the gift of God, (no matter) how many
children God gives us, we should accept," said 39-year-old Maya
Chhetri. She has 12 children now, but is willing to have more.
</P>
<P>
Most of the villagers are illiterate and very poor. Yet the
educated just have as many children.
</P>
<P>
They know about the family planning but dislike it.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Gam Bahadur Thapa, for instance, became
uncooperative with him after he got himself sterilized following
the birth of two children, forcing him and his family to leave the
village.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to generate awareness about the family
planning by the government in this village because people are
doing competition in giving birth to more and more children,"
Chairman of the village development committee Bhupal Rawa was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a population of 21.6 million and it is growing at a
rate of 2.6 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The growth of agricultural production has failed to match that
of the population.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Invest Heavily in Urban Construction, Pillar Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- This north China port city plans to
invest a total of 42.7 billion yuan in urban construction and
pillar industries this year.
</P>
<P>
This was learned at the first session of the 13th Tianjin
Municipal People's Congress, held here today.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be allocated to 48 key projects. The industrial
projects will be mainly in the sectors of electronic information,
biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, new materials, new energy
and environmental protection, which will be built into the city's
new pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some traditional industries, including cement,
polyester, and vehicle engine production, will also be financed.
</P>
<P>
Major urban construction schemes will include the harnessing of
the mainstream of the Haihe River, the building of a coal dock at
Tianjin Port, bringing natural gas from northern Shaanxi to
Tianjin, and the improvement of power, heat and gas supply
networks and sewage systems, and the building of inter-city
highways and city streets.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has invested a total of 38.8 billion yuan in
infrastructure over the past five years, including construction of
expressways, bridges and major streets, expansion of power
supply and housing construction to accommodate 150,000 families.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Zhang Lichang said that he expects that this year's
investment plan will help Tianjin keep its annual GDP growth at 10
percent and retain its status as the economic center for the Bohai
Rim area.

<HEADLINE> China Win Uber Cup Badminton Finals for Sixth Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Runners-up China ensured a record
sixth Uber Cup Finals victory after they scored an unscalable 3-0
lead over defending champions Indonesia in the 17th world women's
team championships final here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was a successful comeback for China, which, after five
consecutive wins from 1984 to 1992, had finished runners-up to
Indonesia in the past two championships.
</P>
<P>
China's world number three Gong Zhichao, 20, was the player of
the day as she won over 10th-ranked Indonesian Mia Audina 9-11,
12-10, 11-4 in the second singles and the third match of the final
in one hour and 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Indonesian had beaten Gong twice in their three
previous meetings since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Audina, Olympic silver-medalist from the Atlanta Games, came
from behind at 4-6 to win the first game 11-9. Gong returned
strongly to take the second after lagging behind 7-10, with superb
volleys and drops.
</P>
<P>
Numerous errors cost Audina badly in the decisive rubber, which
helped Gong lead throughout the game to a 11-4 win.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday evening, China's world number one Ye Zhaoying
defeated world number seven Susi Susanti 11-9, 10-12, 11-5 in the
opening singles match and top-ranked Chinese doubles pair Ge Fei
and Gu Jun downed Indonesians Rosiana Zelin and Indarti Isoliana
15-7, 15-1 in the following doubles.
</P>
<P>
At press time, the two teams are still engaged in the two
remaining matches -- a doubles and a singles, although their
results would in no way affect the Chinese victory.

<HEADLINE> No Deterioration in India's Security Environment: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- India's former Minister of State
for External Affairs Eduardo Faleiro said Saturday that there is
no deterioration in India's security environment so as to give
notice to the world that India is making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There is no probability of conflict with China. In my
knowledge there are no nuclear devices facing India along that
border," he said while addressing a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in his May 11 letter
to nine world leaders asserted that the security environment along
India's border with China is deteriorating, which he said had made
India conduct its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Faleiro lashed out at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
for conducting nuclear tests. He said the BJP did not have the
mandate to take the decision, and demanded that an all-party
parliamentary committee be constituted to examine the "motives and
repercussions" of the nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
"The BJP does not have a mandate to take, on its own, such
decisions which have grave implications in different areas
including defense and foreign policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Coalition partners have complained they were not consulted,"
he added.

HONG KONG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- World badminton powerhouse China
set a record in the number of victories for the Uber Cup Badminton
Finals when they reached an unscalable 3-0 lead to ensure them a

With the lead, the Chinese team virtually won the final of the

</P>
<P>
China had won the Uber Cup Finals for five straight times since

runners-up to Indonesia for the last two championships, in Jakarta
in 1994 and in Hong Kong in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Worldwatch Institute On Species Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Mammals, fish, birds, amphibians
and reptiles--the higher animals known collectively as
vertebrates--are suffering high rates of decline, says a new study
from the Worldwatch Institute.
</P>
<P>
About one in four vertebrate species surveyed so far is in
serious trouble: either declining sharply in numbers,limited to
dangerously small populations, or facing pressure from land
clearance,road building,excessive hunting and fishing, and other
human activities.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the World Conservation Union in collaboration with
over 600 scientists, published a groundbreaking survey of the
status of animal life on Earth. According to their estimates, 25
percent of mammal and amphibian species, 11 percent of birds, 20
percent of reptiles, and 34 percent of fish species surveyed so
far are threatened with extinction. In addition, another 5 to 14
percent of species in these groups are "nearing threatened
status."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Saturday, research fellow with
this Institute John Tuxill said that the declining health of
vertebrates is but one indicator of a decline in many facets of
the natural world. "Plants, insects, snails, and many other
organisms are also threatened. Together, all of these life forms
make up what scientists call biodiversity - the rich diversity of
life that underpins everything from food production to a host of
essential medicines. Unlike other environmental losses, Tuxill
said, this one cannot be reversed. With biodiversity, nature
doesn't give second chances."
</P>
<P>
He said the leading cause of vertebrate declines is human
destruction of old growth forests, wetlands, chaparral, and other
rich habitats. Worldwide, over two-thirds of the earth's habitable
land surface has been significantly disturbed by human activities.
Nearly half of the world's 233 primate species are threatened,
largely because of their dependence on large expanses of tropical
forest, a habitat under siege around the globe. In hotspots of
forest loss, such as Madagascar, the Atlantic rainforest of
eastern Brazil, and Southeast Asia, roughly 70 percent of primate
species face extinction.
</P>
<P>
On a number of possible routes for reversing these mounting
species declines, Tuxill pointed to promising strategies for
conserving biodiversity in countries as diverse as Zambia, Nepal
and the United States, and called for expanded steps at every
level to manage the environment in more ecologically sound and
socially equitable ways.

ABU DHABI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal

Iran and the UAE has been locked in a dispute over ownership of
the three islands located on the edge of the Strait of Hormuz,
which Iran has taken control.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has stood firm in the dispute and kept calling for
returning its full sovereignty over the three islands through a
direct and peaceful dialog or the arbitration of the International
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Iran has so far refused arbitration, saying the islands are an
inseparable part of its territory.

<HEADLINE> White House Documents Released on Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The White House released a trove
of documents Friday showing that U.S. President Bill Clinton
permitted satellite launch with China to the American national
interest.
</P>
<P>
The documents, demanded by Congress and made available to the
news media, indicated that the president approved the Chinese
launching of an American satellite last February after his top
staff advised him that the economic and diplomatic advantages
outweighed the opposition of Federal Prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors had warned that the approval would jeopardize
their investigation into the satellite maker's earlier,
unauthorized help to China's rocket program.
</P>
<P>
The documents argued that they showed that the president, while
aware of the risks, approved the launching on the basis of policy
debate and not because the chairman of the satellite company, the
Democratic Party's largest personal contributor, was pressing hard
for a decision.
</P>
<P>
The White House and State Department both denied that there was
a linkage between the decision making and Democratic Party's
fund-raising efforts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The documents also showed that the State Department and other
agencies had determined that the launch by Loral Space and
Communications Ltd. was in "the national interest" and recommended
approval.
</P>
<P>
The documents were released at a time when congressional
Republicans accused the president of jeopardizing the nation's
security in granting a waiver to the American company. They
suggested that the decision to do so was influenced by campaign
contributions from Loral Chairman Bernard L. Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
The documents were handed over to Congress as the
administration sought to buttress its contention that the
decision to grant the waiver was made on its merits.
</P>
<P>
"These documents reflect the serious policymaking on national
interests grounds that goes into satellite waivers," said White
House spokesman Michael McCurry. "They also make clear that those
who are taking political cheap shots should butt out."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said in the White House Rose Garden
that his decision was the correct one and "was based on what I
thought was in the national interest and supportive of our
national security."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Justice Department's concerns were evaluated
and balanced against the views of all the other participating
departments, who "concluded that, on balance, we should go
forward."
</P>
<P>
However, Republicans questioned the president's decision and
vowed to carry out further inquiries. They said a preliminary
review of the 394 documents the White House released raised
troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question there were plenty of red flags at the
time," said Representative Christopher Cox, the California
Republican who will head a House select committee examining the
China Issues.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Will Not Give Up Nuclear Option: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif made it clear on Saturday that his country will not give up
its nuclear option despite the mounting pressure from some big
powers in this regard in the wake of India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"We are not seeking any bargains," Sharif said in a written
statement issued at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
It is the first press conference given by the prime minister
since India conducted a series of nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
"Overt Indian nuclear weaponization has seriously upset the
strategic balance in the region and emboldened India to make a
naked assertion of her hostile intentions towards Pakistan," the
prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"Can the Pakistani nation afford to barter its independence,
security and sovereignty? What is the price for liberty and
freedom, dignity and honor?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"The talk of sanctions is not only familiar to us but it also
does not rattle us. We have learnt to live with these punitive
measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our legitimate need for security is still being ignored," he
said, regretting that discriminatory policies were pursued by the
Western world on the nuclear issue towards Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Indian defiance (in nuclear tests) on the other hand has even
now attracted some sanctions but more understanding. Some have
even offered endorsement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of condemnation or sanctions have changed the
immediacy or magnitude of the threat to us. Practically sanctions
mean little and change nothing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Indian actions have rendered the
non-proliferation regime and instruments such as Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
irrelevant," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What did we earn in exchange of the restraint? Discriminatory
and punitive measures were imposed on us. In a manifestly unjust
and unfair approach Pakistan was penalized for every Indian
escalatory step on the nuclear and ballistic ladder," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian record of aggression and irresponsible behavior is
a stark reality for Pakistan. Our compulsions are not hidden. The
balance of power in the region has been violently tilted," Sharif
said.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances our undivided focus must be on the
preservation of our national security interests," he said.

shoulder a great responsibility for changing the path of the
nation when it is facing a decisive moment.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism in the north should be defeated and all political

<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister Tsakhya
Elbegdorj said Saturday that his country's financial situation is
critical.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters one month after he took office, Elbegdorj
said that one of the major causes of the situation is the Asian
financial crisis that impacted adversely on the Mongolian economy.
</P>
<P>
Copper, gold and wool has been the major export commodities of
Mongolia, Elbegdorj said.
</P>
<P>
The price drop of these commodities in the world market has
made Mongolia unable to earn its anticipated income, while cheap
goods from the Asian market has lead to an increase of imports and
a trade deficit, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is formulating a new economic and social
development strategy, which is focusing on increasing income and
practicing frugality.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will take more efforts to reform
customs, finance and accounting, the tax and statistics
departments.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Outgoing PM Casts Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's outgoing Premier
Ntsu Mokhehle cast his last vote as a politician at a polling
station outside the capital Maseru as voting got under way in the
tiny mountain kingdom's third general election Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his wife Mmaneo, Mokhehle walked into the
polling station just before 10 a.m. They immediately left
afterwards, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old politician, who decided not to contend for the
election because of age and illness, said he cast his vote with a
sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy that the election had been peaceful so
far, and some political parties who threatened earlier to boycott
the poll were participating in the election. He also expressed
satisfaction at the apparent high turnout of voters.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said it was fitting that he left the political arena
at this point as he did not want to lead the country "too long"
and bore people.
</P>
<P>
"It's boring to be a leader for too long. People tend to get
bored and ultimately revolt against you," said Mokhehle, who
founded the Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) in 1952 and led it
to victory in the 1993 election.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said he was going to write books about political
liberation movements after retiring.
</P>
<P>
His writings would deal with South Africa's African National
Congress (ANC) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAN), and the BCP and
his newly established Lesotho Congress For Democracy (LCD).
</P>
<P>
About 1.3 million voters are expected to cast their ballots to
select the country's new legislators from more than 400
candidates.

<HEADLINE> A Japanese Movie Confusing Right and Wrong (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- In Japan, once every while, there
usually will be someone coming up to whitewash Japanese war
criminals and its wars of aggression in history. The movie "Pride,
the Fateful Moment," which is now on there, is just another example.
</P>
<P>
The movie, by distorting historic truth, confusing right and
wrong, and boisterously glorifying Hideko Tojo, a class-A war
criminal whose hands dripped with the blood of peoples of Asian
countries, and the Japanese evil war of aggression, is intended to
overturn the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
To highlight an image of "patriotism and pride" for Tojo is the
first major attempt of the movie script writer and director.
</P>
<P>
According to the script, Tojo, after the defeat of Japan in the
war, keeps his "astonishing" dignity before he is arrested. During
the trials, Tojo, remaining calm and at easy, speaks forcefully
and volubly in self-justification. And when the tribunal's rule is
announced sentencing him and six other war criminals to be hanged,
Tojo "nods twice, and then the third time, seemingly wearing a
smile." As the director's brain product, Tojo appears completely a
hero. Talking to his lawyers, Tojo says, puffed up with pride, "I
was not wrong. What I did was right." "We lost because we didn't
have enough power. But we must keep our nation's honor up."
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Hideko Tojo, Adolf Hitler and Benito
Mussolini are locked together on the pillory of history as top
fascist criminals of World War II. Historic records show
that Tojo committed too many crimes.
</P>
<P>
As military police chief of the Kanto Army Group, Tojo came to
northeast China to fanatically suppress the anti-Japanese struggle
of the Chinese people. He was later promoted as chief of staff of
the notorious Kanto Army Group.
</P>
<P>
After Japan used the Lugouqiao (or Marco Polo Bridge) Incident
as an excuse to launch an all-out aggression against China, Tojo
led his "Tojo troops" into north China and carried out the policy
of "burning all, killing all and looting all."
</P>
<P>
After becoming the army minister in the Konoe Fumimaro cabinet,
he strongly advocated further escalating the aggression in China
and starting another against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
As the Fumimaro cabinet stepped down, Tojo, on the peak of his
power, grabbed the portfolios of prime minister, army minister,
interior minister, military supplies minister and general chief of
staff, to apply an authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his active role in masterminding and
implementing Japan's policies of aggression against China, he
extended the flames of war from China to the Pacific region and
Southeast Asia to impose sufferings on more countries and more
peoples.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tojo established a Taisei Yusankai to replace the
assembly and to intensify fascist rule in Japan.
</P>
<P>
He saved no efforts to preach the theory of "Great East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere," and plotted to set up a "Great East Asia
Province" for plundering more from the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
After Japan's surrender, Tojo attempted a suicide to escape
punishment, and was hanged on December 23, 1948, by the order of
the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Even death
could not expiate all his crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, to such an unpardonable war criminal, the movie script
writer and director have shown their special love. Fifty years
after Tojo was sent to the gallows, they, blind to Tojo's
distorted personality as a war maniac and all his crimes, cudgeled
their brains to deliberately depict Tojo as a fearless "hero" with
human touch.
</P>
<P>
Besides reversing the verdict on Tojo, their other objective is
to wake up "self-esteem" in the Japanese people by using Tojo's
"personality" power they have concocted for him, and make people
regard the war as a great pride of the Japanese nation so as to
discard their "self-sadistic conception of history," the admission
of the Japanese war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
The second major attempt of the script writer and the director
is to deny the legitimacy of the Tokyo trial of war criminals.
</P>
<P>
In the movie, they argue in the words of a defense lawyer that
the trial at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East
was wrong, that it was "a trial by the winner of the loser, a
direct trial by the victim of the aggressor, and thus it couldn't
be fair."
</P>
<P>
The movie deliberately ignores the historic facts that the
prosecutors and judges, who represented the world's force of
justice, made convincing arguments against and sharp cross
examinations of the war criminals, and tarnishes the chief judge's
image by depicting him as crude and rude, and sometimes even petty
and weak. On the other hand, Hideko Tojo and other war criminals
in the court appear calm and assured. This portraying, obviously
distorted, has an ulterior motive.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pupils to Get UN Environmental Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has announced
that a group of school children living in central and southern
China are to receive the 1998 U.N. environment award owing to
their "outstanding contributions" in the field.
</P>
<P>
The Red Scarf Environment Protection Action Group (RSAG),
formed by pupils in Wangyue Primary School in Changsha, Hunan
Province in 1991, will get the annual "Youth Environment Global
500 Roll" in Moscow on June 5, the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Since the RSAG was set up, its members once a week leave the
school to observe their environment, analyze pollution problems
and propose solutions to the polluters and the government, said
the Nairobi-Based U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the group discovered that a lot of waste water from a
brewery was being discharged into Xiangjiang River, a tributary
of China's longest Yangtse River, without any treatment.
</P>
<P>
It was at the RSAG's suggestion and under its supervision that
a waste water treatment station was built, said UNEP chief Klaus
Topfer Friday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, RSAG launched a campaign against so-called white
pollution, which was finally joined by more than 10,000 students
throughout the city, leading to a ban by the local authorities on
the use of all plastic foam dinner sets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The RSAG children have also carried out various activities to
promote environmental education among the young people in the
provincial capital city.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, their school Wangyue, which was established in 1989,
was chosen as an environmental education model by the Environment
Protection Agency of Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
"These environmental defenders have demonstrated that it is at
the community and local level where action to protect the
environment acquires its full meaning," said the UNEP chief.
</P>
<P>
"In honoring them, UNEP hopes that their example will inspire
and guide many other men, women and young people to join the
global coalition dedicated to protecting the environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 individuals and organizations all over the world
will be awarded by U.N. for their achievements in environment
protection this year.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP launched the Global 500 award in both adult and youth
categories in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says Indian "Misadventure" to Meet Resolute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said on Saturday that "any misadventure" made by India
would meet a "resolute response," but he reiterated that any
decision would be made in Pakistan's "supreme interests."
</P>
<P>
Sharif was addressing a press briefing here, which was attended
by more than 100 foreign and local reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We have to contend with new realities -- heightened dangers
and an immediate threat (from India) to our security... which may
materialize any moment" ever since India exploded its nuclear
devices on May 11 and 13, he said.
</P>
<P>
But "our nation has arisen to the occasion. There is complete
national consensus to respond to the challenges and threat. This
nation has a history of facing challenges and has never submitted
to threats," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"Any adventure will be meeting a resolute response," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that any decision would be in the supreme interests
of the country, Sharif said Pakistan will "behave like a mature
nation."
</P>
<P>
"The whole nation has demonstrated a sober and mature approach
to this complicated situation. We have not behaved in a
tit-for-tat manner. We have not let any madness engulf us," he
said. "Whatever decision we will eventually take it will be in
our supreme national interest."
</P>
<P>
Sharif said Indian nuclear blasts were an attempt to force
Pakistan to abandon its indigenous nuclear program, and to seek a
military solution to the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
He referred to Pakistan's peaceful initiative to hold dialogue
with India to resolve the Kashmir issue in a peaceful manner.
India, however, has "answered it with atomic tests and gone to the
extent of threatening to use nuclear weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his disappointment over the reaction of the world
community to the Indian nuclear weaponization, the Pakistani prime
minister said it was a sort of encouragement for New Delhi to
continue its "hegemonistic designs."
</P>
<P>
Talking about his telephone conversation with U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Sharif said he appreciates the concern of world
leaders and hopes that they will stop India from carrying out its
nuclear program.

<HEADLINE> A Japanese Movie Confusing Right and Wrong (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of Japanese war criminal at the International
Military Tribunal for the Far East was a serious and significant
trial in human history. It was also a tough contest between the
world's just force and the Japanese fascists.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal collected numerous pieces of evidence on the
crimes committed by the suspects, including notes taken at
meetings chaired by the Japanese emperor, and at meetings of the
cabinet and of the five top ministers, secret documents of the
puppet Manchukuo regime and of the Nazi German foreign ministry,
and the testimonies of over 1,000 witnesses, including Aisin
Giorro Pu Yi, puppet emperor of Manchukuo. The tribunal also heard
the testimony of over a thousand witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Although Japan invited "learned and capable" U.S. lawyers to
defend its war criminal suspects during cross examination session,
the prosecutors, with an overwhelming amount of hard evidence on
their side, often rendered criminals and their lawyers speechless.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo trial lasted two years and a half. During this
period, the tribunal held 818 court sessions, where a total of 419
witnesses and 4,300 documents were presented. The notes of the
trial, in English, ran 48,412 pages.
</P>
<P>
It took the tribunal nine days, from November 4 to 12, 1948, to
finish reading its 1,213-page verdict. Tojo, the top criminal, got
the punishment he deserved.
</P>
<P>
Denying the criminal nature of the Japanese war of aggression
is the third major attempt of the movie script writer and director.
</P>
<P>
They propagate that the Great East Asia War is "a self-defense
war from the beginning to the end" and a "holy war" aimed at
"liberating" Asia from the "the White rule."
</P>
<P>
As to Japan's crimes in launching the war, they preach, through
the mouths of Japanese lawyers in the movie, that "the war itself
is legal under international law, and killings in war do not
constitute a crime."
</P>
<P>
"It is a pity that some Japanese troops produced brutal events
in China, but such events have been exaggerated, or even
fabricated," they say, adding that "the Nanjing (Nanking) Massacre
does not exist."
</P>
<P>
The war Japan launched against China and other Asian countries
was aggression -- a conclusion reached long ago by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
It was launched in the 1930s because of the intensification of
Japan's domestic economic and political contradictions and the
radical changes in the international environment.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis in the capitalist world at that time made
Japanese militarism to quicken its pace to invasion.
</P>
<P>
To rid itself of severe economic and social crisis, Japan
adopted Fascist dictatorship, speeded up militarization of its
national economy, started successive aggressions in order to seize
overseas markets by force, re-divide the world and find ways out
of the crisis through war.
</P>
<P>
With the national policy of establishing a "Great East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere," Japan launched the war to set up its East
Asia Empire and exercise colonial rule in the region. The Japanese
aggression brought an unprecedented disaster to the Asian people.
</P>
<P>
In China, the Japanese aggressors committed the most brutal and
ruthless crime in human history, the Nanjing (Nanking) Massacre,
an unparalleled savagery, being a typical example.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese aggression ruined Asia's economy and culture, and
its people were reduced to living in absolute poverty. It took
Asian countries a very long time and painful efforts to heel the
wounds.
</P>
<P>
These are striking evidence of crimes committed by the Japanese
aggressors and there is simply no denying of it.
</P>
<P>
However, instead of admitting the aggressive nature of the war,
the Japanese ultra-rightist force, including the movie producers,
tried every means to whitewash it as a just war for liberation of
the Asian people.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of producing such stuff is to confuse historical
facts and deceive the Japanese people, especially the younger
generation. It cannot but make the Asian people, including the
Japanese people, to sharpen their vigilance.
</P>
<P>
The making of this reactionary movie is not something
accidental. It reflects the ever existence of militarist thinking
in Japan. The ideas expressed in it are not anything new, but
belong to the same category promoted by Japan's post-war
ultra-rightest force.
</P>
<P>
What is worrying after all is that the ultra-rightest force
does still have some following in Japan. Otherwise, this
reactionary movie would not have been screened for the public.
</P>
<P>
It is worth our serious thinking about who is behind the scene
to protect and promote the making of the film.
</P>
<P>
We have also noticed that the movie has been severely
criticized and condemned by individuals with sense of justice,
organizations and media in Japan and the international community.
</P>
<P>
History and reality tell us that anyone who goes against
historical trends are doomed to fail and end up in lifting a rock
to drop it only on his own feet.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Condemns Child Labor As Modern Form of Slavery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
condemned child labor as a "modern form of slavery."
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Saturday with 13 former child slaves from
Third World countries on a "World March" to protest child labor,
Chirac said slavery is far from being eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Exploitation, No, No, No! Education, Yes, Yes, Yes!"
the members of "World March" arrived in France on Friday and were
received by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in the southwest port
city of La Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the year to commemorate the abolition of
slavery. The truth is that slavery is far from being abolished, it
still exists where children are concerned," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"The children have told us with much force and emotion their
own stories. They know of many other similar stories told on the
streets by children living in different cities on different
continents," he said. All his guests had reportedly been subjected
to servitude in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the campaign being launched by these children
"should have good results."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed support to the International Labor
Organization to elaborate new laws on banning child labor.
</P>
<P>
"This is new. It is important to abolish the practices which
are absolutely inhumane, scandalous and which no longer fit our
time on the eve of the 21st century," said Chirac.

GUANGZHOU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Police in south China's Guangdong
Province recently smashed a certificate forging factory, arresting
three suspects and seizing 150 forged passports and other phoney
certificates as well as facilities used for forging purposes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Literary and art circles in China
must follow Jiang Zemin's directions on literature and art in
their artistic production and research, a senior culture official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zhanxiang, vice-chairman of the China Federation of
Literary and Art Circles (CFLAC), made the statement at a
symposium held by the CFLAC and Chinese Writers' Association to
commemorate the 56th anniversary of Mao Zedong's famous speech on
literary and art work in Yan'an in 1942, and the letter Chinese
President Jiang Zemin wrote on May 20, 1995 to 100 Chinese artists
who were to attend a nationwide cultural activity with the theme
of collecting folk arts across the country, which was made public
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The letter calls on Chinese artists to realize the prosperity
of cultural and art creation in accordance to the country's new
situation, Gao said, adding that it also provides basic
policies for current literature and art work.
</P>
<P>
The policies of "going deeper into the masses and grassroots,
and serving the people and socialism," inherit and further develop
Marxist aesthetic principles, as well as Mao Zedong's and Deng
Xiaoping's theories on literature and art, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, Chinese artists have collected
abundant folk art works and have created a lot of good products in
the fields of literature, music, film and painting.

<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- King Hassan II of Morocco will visit
Egypt next Tuesday for discussions with Egyptian leaders on
regional issues and a number of bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a high-ranking delegation including a number of
his ministers, the Moroccan king will pay a three-day state visit
to Egypt at the invitation of President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will preside over the second session of the
Egyptian-Moroccan Higher Joint Committee meetings, Egypt's
Ambassador to Morocco Amin Ahmed Amin said in an interview with
Voice of Arabs Radio Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the committee meetings was held in Rabat a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The committee will deal with ways of fostering economic ties
and a number of agreements will be signed during the forthcoming
session.
</P>
<P>
The final agreement on setting up a joint free trade zone for
furthering bilateral trade will also be endorsed during the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The joint Egyptian-Moroccan Technical Committee will also
resume talks on the activities of the free trade zone after the
two sides agreed in last July on the broad outlines of the list of
goods and the transitional period of trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade exchange between both sides is "very modest,"
according to Egyptian Minister of Supply and Trade Ahmed
Gowaili. Moroccan imports from Egypt were 15 million U.S. dollars
and Moroccan exports to Egypt stood at 5 million dollars in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Two South Africans Starts Final Stages of Qomolangma Ascent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two South African mountaineers
started the final stages of their attempt to reach the summit of
Mount Qomolangma early Saturday, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The expedition's general manager, Clare Ellis, said Ian Woodall
and Cathy O'Dowd, together with their Sherpa guides (Tibetan
guides), started their climb to camp three, situated at 8,200
meters above sea level, after high winds on the mountain dropped
slightly.
</P>
<P>
They will start the final assault on the summit from the north,
or the Chinese side, at about 10 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) on
Saturday, Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
The two hoped to stand on top of the world's tallest mountain
on Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Success on Qomolangma depends on a short window period when the
jet stream, or high winds that create the familiar plume off the
summit, abate for about two weeks in early May. But the gap this
year has arrived later than normal.
</P>
<P>
In May 1996 Woodall and O'Dowd negotiated the world's tallest
mountain from the south, or Nepalese side, to become the first
South Africans to stand on the Himalayan peak.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Acts to Forestall Bursting of Glacial Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Efforts have been made to
forestall the possible bursting of the Tsho-Rolpa glacial lake in
the Himalayas, Nepal's official RSS news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The major task now is to siphon by various means the water of
the three-km-long and half-km-wide glacial lake, the largest in
Nepal, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Now the lake is estimated to contain more than 80 million cubic
meters of water.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the excessive pressure of water and earthquakes can
cause the moraine dam to burst. Minor earthquakes have hit
different parts of the country in recent months.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology
said that works will be carried out to reduce by three meters the
water level of the glacial lake, which is 4,580 meters above sea
level in the Rolwaling Valley, about 80 km east of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government and some international organizations have
been working together in the past four years to ensure the safety
of residents and property in case the lake bursts, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has installed sirens at 17 places, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Press reports of an imminent bursting of the glacial lake last
summer not only caused panic in the flood-prone areas, but also
caught the attention of the whole country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Leaves for UAE for Talks on Territorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday
to explore ways to resolve territorial dispute over three Islands
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported that Kharrazi will
discuss bilateral relations and regional developments with UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan and Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Kharrazi expressed hope that his visit
will open a new chapter in Tehran-Abu Dhabi relationship and will
leave a positive impact on regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is nothing exceptional about Tehran's
relations with Abu Dhabi in the context of Iran's ties with the
Persian Gulf littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said during his visit to a number of Arab states in
the region, including the UAE, last November, he was unable to
meet the UAE president "to convey the message of friendship of the
new Iranian administration" because the president was on a trip
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the UAE were strained because their
dispute over the islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the
Lesser Tunb at the mouth of the strategic Hormoz Strait, over
which both Iran and the UAE claimed full sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The UAE called for an international arbitration over the
dispute but Iran claimed that the "misunderstanding" between the
two countries should be solved through mutual talks.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also praised the statement of Saudi Interior Minister
Prince Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz that Saudis were behind the 1996
Khobar blast and there has been no Iranian connection, previously
suggested by western media reports, in the case.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister Friday ruled out foreign involvement in the
truck bombing of a U.S. military complex in the eastern Saudi town
of Khobar, in which 19 U.S. servicemen were killed.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that from the beginning it was clear that the
issue was an internal one, but those with bad intentions to damage
relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia were at work to implicate
Iran in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The statements coming from Saudi Arabia reflect the realities,
demonstrating the courage and power of the Saudi officials who
have adopted an independent stance despite foreign pressure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran welcomes the recent approach and the resolve of the Saudi
officials and favors further promotion of Tehran-Riyadh
relations, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The stance of the Saudi interior minister is a sign of firm
decision and political resolve of the Saudi officials to remove
any misunderstanding from public opinion and to boost ties with
Tehran, he added.

DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on
Saturday laid the foundation stone of the country's third export
processing zone (EPZ), in the Mongla sea port, southern
Bangladesh's Bagerhat district, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the Mongla EPZ, in the country's second

<P>
The government believes in balanced development of all regions

achieving economic development of the country through attracting
entrepreneurs from home and abroad and creating more employment
opportunities, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to come out of the disgraceful situation of
aid-dependence. Our target is trade, not aid," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>

respectively, contributed 11 percent to the country's total export
earnings of about 4.4 billion U.S. dollars during the last
financial year ending June 30, 1997, she said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 113 enterprises are in operation in the Chittagong

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Popularity Smashes Political Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Popularity proved to be a decisive
winning factor in the Philippines' May 11 presidential election,
in which a former action movie star leads with a wide margin over
his nine rivals.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Joseph Estrada, a movie star-turned-politician,
has maintained a commanding lead in an unofficial quick count of
the votes conducted by the authoritative National Citizen Movement
for Free Elections (Namfrel).
</P>
<P>
The Namfrel is the sole non-governmental group accredited by
the country's Commission on Elections (Comelec) to conduct the
unofficial quick counting of votes in the national elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest partial results issued by the group,
Estrada of the opposition LAMMP (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses) party garnered 8.24 million votes, 37.1 percent of the
22.2 million votes counted in nearly 80 percent of the total
170,000 precincts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's nearest rival, Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia of the ruling party, gained only
3.24 million votes, 14.6 percent of the votes tallied.
</P>
<P>
Seven of Estrada's nine rivals have conceded defeat and a lot
of his long-time critics, including influential Manila Archbishop
Jaime Sin and the business community, have expressed their
readiness to accept Estrada's presidency.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia himself admitted that Estrada's lead is
insurmountable, but he vowed not to concede until the last vote is
counted.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's runaway victory made a mockery of the ruling
Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats) party's
powerful political machinery and the endorsement of outgoing
President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The camp of de Venecia had claimed that the speaker would give
the highly popular Estrada a close fight given the ruling party's
clear organizational advantage over the opposition and the strong
support of Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts attributed Estrada's comfortable lead to his
high popularity among the ordinary people, a pervasive discontent
among the masses with the status quo and the ruling party's
breakup caused by the nomination row.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's high popularity among the ordinary people was proved
in an exit poll conducted by the country's most respected
pollster, the Social Weather Station (SWS). The poll showed that
about 52 percent of Estrada's votes were from the middle-lower
classes, or the masses who make up more than 60 percent of the
Philippines' 70 million population.
</P>
<P>
The broad and secure mass support Estrada enjoys is largely
attributed to his movie star background and his populist pro-poor
campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who made a household name in the 1960s by playing
Robin Hood-style heroes fighting for the poor, has long been seen
by the masses as "the champion of the poor and defender of the
underdog."
</P>
<P>
Estrada's popularity among the masses has been further
strengthened by his populist pro-poor campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
In his platform, Estrada promises to give priority to
agriculture and food security since the bulk of the population is
engaged in farming and the country has often suffered food
shortages due to the backward agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's pro-poor platform has been well-received by the
middle-lower classes because they have been waiting too long to
have a larger share of the benefits of economic growth achieved
under the Ramos administration, political analyst John Gilburea
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has enjoyed rapid economic growth since 1992
thanks to the economic reforms initiated by Ramos. But the
economic growth has failed to improve the life of the lower
classes.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the gap between the poor and the rich has further
widened and the official poverty incidence is still as high as 35
percent, only six percentage points lower than the 1992 level.
</P>
<P>
The regional financial crisis hitting the country last July
added fuel to the flames of dissatisfaction among the poor with
the status quo.
</P>
<P>
"To the masses, Estrada signifies change, while other
presidential candidates personify the establishment or the status
quo," said Gilburea. "To the uneducated, laborers and workers, the
poor and needy, status quo means their continued bondage to
poverty and want."
</P>
<P>
"This pervasive mood for changes subordinates everything, even
the so-called formidable political machine and organization of the
ruling party," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some analysts said, the weakening strength of the
ruling party due to a series of infighting and the poor image of
de Venecia also helped Estrada land at Malacanang, the country's
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
"Even before the election, Lakas had dug its own grave," said
political analyst Amando Doronila. "In endorsing Speaker Jose de
Venecia, President Ramos precipitated the breakup of Lakas, and by
the time the campaign began in February, Lakas was already a
fractured party."
</P>
<P>
Due to the row over Ramos' choice, former presidential economic
adviser Emilio Osmena and former Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa, both close friends of Ramos, bolted the party and competed
for the presidency on their own.
</P>
<P>
The participation of Osmena and de Villa in the presidential
race significantly split the votes for the ruling party, playing
into the hands of Estrada who has a stable constituency among the
masses.
</P>
<P>
What's more, political analysts said, Ramos' choice of de
Venecia was "a hard-sell political product" that is too difficult
for the ruling party and Ramos to make over and promote among the
voters.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia had been lackluster in various pre-election opinion
polls because of his acknowledged image as a "trapo" (Filipino
parlance for the traditional politician good at backroom deals and
fond of staying in power).
</P>
<P>
"De Venecia was too unpopular and a proof of this is that many
Lakas governors won reelection in areas swept by Estrada," said
Doronila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is now waiting for the proclamation of his victory by
the bicameral congress which will begin the official canvassing of
votes for the president and the vice president next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although Estrada is expected to be another minority president
of the country, yet with an estimated 37-percent win, the ex-movie
star may do better than his predecessor Ramos who got only 23
percent of the votes in 1992.

LUANDA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A vehicle of the United Nations
Observers Mission in Angola was attacked when driving on a road
in the north province of Malanje Wednesday, resulting in one
killed and three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A news release available here Saturday said unidentified armed
men mounted an attack on the car at a bridge five km north of
Calandula city in the province, killing an Angolan interpreter.

<P>
The three injured in the mission were a commander of the
national police in Calandula, a Kenyan army man and a Malian
policeman, and they were all sent to a hospital in Luanda for
treatment.

<P>
A team comprising U.N. senior officers and policemen went to

The government has blamed ex-soldiers of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for the armed raids
on civilian targets, but the U.N. release did not mention UNITA
in the incident so far.

NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- In a rare instance of the church
taking an open political stand, The National Council of Churches

tests and flayed efforts of the ruling Bharati Janata Party (BJP)

In a statement, the NCCI said: "As the largest nation of the
subcontinent, we should be promoting peaceful coexistence... not
be seen as a hegemonic power."
</P>
<P>
There was "escalation of nuclear threat in our own
subcontinent," it said. A nation that through ages stood for peace
appears to be taking the opposite direction, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statements by the prime minister and the home minister and
their offices "seem to smack of hegemonistic tendencies towards

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Use Hyacinth as Fertilizer for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to use
hyacinth, a weed growing rampantly in Lake Victoria which hampers
the free movement of ships, as fertilizer for mushrooms growing.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH)
will pump into the mushroom growing projects one million
shillings (about 1,500 U.S. Dollars), and an equivalent amount
will come from the Zero Emissions Research Initiative (ZERI),
"Daily Mail" said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A seven-man expert team, headed by the Director of the Center
for the Development and Transfer of Technology, a subsidiary of
the COSTECH, S. J. Asman, is making preparations for the
launching of the five projects in Mwanza on Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The report for the implementation of the projects is expected
to be presented at the Fourth ZERI Congress in Windoek, Namibia
in October, Asman said. ZERI was launched in July 1994 at the
United Nations University in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The team is joined by experts from the Ministry of
Agriculture, the Applied Microbiology Unit of the University of
Dar es Salaam, the Mwanza Municipal Council and the
Mikocheni-based Agricultural Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Asman said that a Zimbabwean ZERI expert will soon come to Dar
es Salaam to help implement the projects.
</P>
<P>
The experts have agreed to make use of facilities at the
Mwanza Fisheries Research Institute and a non-governmental
organization which is collecting the water hyacinth in Mwanza.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Task force also agreed that with the help of
non governmental organizations (NGOs), sites for the pilot
projects should be decided and people be trained in cultivating
mushroom, which is in great demand both in Tanzanian and
international markets.

<HEADLINE> Little Gender Difference among Chinese Net-Using Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- There is little gender difference
in the frequency of using computers and visiting the Internet among
Chinese journalists, according to a symposium, which closed
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, ``Women Journalists and the 21st Century'',
witnessed the release of a survey on some 1,100 journalists here
earlier this month, which shows that about 90 percent of them are
computer users, and over one quarter of them visit the Internet
regularly.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the journalists use computers and the
Internet to write stories and get information. Only a few
of them conduct interviews, analyze news information and exchange
ideas through the net. There is little gender difference either in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Bu Wei, an associate research fellow with the Institute of
Journalism and Mass Communications under the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS), who reported the survey, said that
computers have changed the way of human communication greatly, and
that grasping the computers and the Internet means obtaining power
over getting and releasing information.
</P>
<P>
"Women should catch up with the trend so as not to be left out
in the era of information," she said. "Otherwise, the gender
inequality will worsen.
</P>
<P>
"That is why many researchers care about the proportion
of women Internet users, and is why we conducted the survey," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Bu and her colleagues and journalists from the Capital Women
Journalists Association surveyed some 1,100 journalists from the
"People's Daily", the Xinhua News Agency and the English-language
Newspaper "China Daily", and found that "women and men journalists
occupy the same position in terms of using computers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
"We may thus be optimistic about the improvement of the present
situation that women account for one third of Chinese
journalists but occupy less than five percent of the leadership
positions in the Chinese mass media," said Chen Chongshan, a
research fellow with CASS's Institute of Journalism and Mass
Communications.
</P>
<P>
Women journalists have become the leading force among Chinese
women Internet-users, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in China women account for only 12
percent of net users, as compared with over 40 percent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in May 1995, China's Internet servers serve some
620,000 users of nearly 300,000 computers.

Republic on the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
As electoral officials in Belfast opened the sealed and audited
ballot boxes containing the people's verdict, an exit poll revealed
Saturday suggested a majority of voters on both sides of the Irish
border had voted for the Northern Ireland peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures from the poll for Ireland's RTE television
showed more than 70 percent of Northern Irish voters had voted
"Yes" in the referendum; while in the Irish Republic, 95 percent of
polled voters had backed the agreement that was reached last month.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is the first time since 1918 that all the people
of Ireland have voted in the same ballot.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation said officials from both
sides of the border had said turnout had been huge, with around 80
percent reported in the North.
</P>
<P>
There was some violence during voting Friday night. Police were
pelted with petrol and paint bombs in Londonderry ans Strabane in
County Tyrone, according to BBC report. Security had been stepped
up throughout the day to guard against potential attacks by
splinter paramilitary groups which oppose the accord.
</P>
<P>
High turnouts in nationalist areas and among first-time voters
and people who did not normally vote had earlier signalled that the
referendum was swinging decisively towards the Yes campaign.
</P>
<P>
But polls showed that the pro-British Protestants were still
divided over the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Northern Ireland will remain in Britain
while building closer ties with Ireland. An assembly will be
established and prisoners of paramilitary groups will be released
within two years.
</P>
<P>
The split among Protestants reflected opposition to the
peace deal's provisions for the early release of prisoners
jailed for their part in three decades of conflict which cost
some 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
Final result of the voting will be expected on Saturday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Indian Home Minister in Charge of Jammu-Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Indian Home Minister L. K.
Advani, seen as intransigent on the Kashmir issue, has been given
the charge of the department of India-held Jammu and Kashmir
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The president of India, as advised by the prime minister, has
directed that the prime minister will relinquish the charge of the
department of Jammu and Kashmir affairs and L. K. Advani, minister
of home affairs, will assume charge of the department," said a
communique from the president's office here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to cast a new shadow over the Kashmir issue, the
major dispute between India and Pakistan in the past more than
five decades, after Advani took the charge of the Kashmir affairs.
Advani last week time and again threatened Pakistan regarding the
Kashmir issue. He said here, for instance, on May 18 after a
high-level meeting on Kashmir that Islamabad should realize a
change in the geo-strategic situation in the region and the world
and roll back its anti-India policy, especially with regard to
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp reaction to Advani's warning, Pakistan on the same
day said any Indian misadventure would certainly attract a swift
and telling reply.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued a strong-worded
statement here Friday fully supporting Advani's stand on the
Kashmir issue.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gurkha Soldiers Demand Increased Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The facilities for former Gurkha
soldiers who served in the British army should be increased in
accordance with a tri-partite agreement reached in 1947 between
Nepal, Britain and India, some Gurkha soldiers said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, who were honored with the Victoria Cross, the
highest honor medal of the British army, told a press conference
that they will get their demands fulfilled through diplomatic
channels.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 Gurkhas won the Victoria Cross (VC) for acts of
bravery during the First and Second World Wars. Six of them have
died.
</P>
<P>
Nepali King Birendra granted an audience on Friday to four of
the VC winners at the Royal Palace, the first time for him to do
so.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with the VC winners on Friday, Nepali Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said the government would try to
resolve their problem through talks.
</P>
<P>
The demands put forward by the Gurkhas include pension parity
for the retired Gurkhas with their British counterparts, the right
to stay and work in Britain, establishment of a welfare fund for
the children of the Gurkhas and pensions for those dismissed
without pensions.
</P>
<P>
VC winner Captain Ganju Lama said about 250,000 Nepalese
soldiers fought during the First and Second World Wars and 15,000
of them were killed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 2,500 to 3,000 Nepalese are serving in the British
army, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1947 tri-partite treaty, the British and Indian
armies can recruit the Nepalese, who have been popularly known as
Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
But the British army drafted the Nepalese already in 1816 under
the Sugauli Treaty signed between Nepal and the East India Company
of Britain.

PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- 13 children from different countries in the Third World
arrived in Paris on Friday on a ``World March'' across the globe to
protest slavery of children. Like 40 million other children around
the world who are reduced to the state of servitude, all of them
have worked in extremely cruel conditions as child slaves. They were
received by French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
-- One of the talents of the pilots of Air France is to choose
the right time to stage strikes. Warning of a movement which would
stop the flow of air traffic during the 1998 Football World Cup
finals, the three minority unions of the pilots have decided to
trouble the airspace of France this weekend by staging a strike, to
protest a plan by the air company to cut their salaries by 15
percent in exchange for its stocks.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Paris stock exchange index ended on Friday with a new
record high, the 33rd since the beginning of January. The CAC 40
stock index rose by 0.05 percent to stand at 4,049.78 points, 35
percent higher than that at the beginning of January. The stock
market was particularly active with 14 billion francs (2.3 billion
U.S. dollars) of stocks changed hands on Friday.
</P>

-- After two months of unusual calmness, the blind terror once
again struck Algeria on Friday in a bomb attack on a marketplace
near Algiers, killing 13 people and injuring dozens.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for More Malaysian Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- After the U.S. waived sanctions upon
foreign companies doing big business with Iran, Tehran encouraged
Malaysia to be more active in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri Saturday told his
Malaysian counterpart that Malaysia can be enganged in more
development projects in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Companies from Malaysia, France and Russia had signed a
contract totaling 2 billion U.S. dollars with Iran to tap a gas
field in the Persian Gulf before the U.S. threatened sanctions
against them under a domestic law designed to isolate
Iran. Washington called off the threats early this week in strong
international opposition.
</P>
<P>
Nouri made the remarks when seeing off the Malaysian House of
Representatives Speaker Muhammad Zahir Ismail at the airport after
his week-long visit to Tehran, the Iranian official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Ismail termed his talks with Iranian
officials as "productive," expressing the hope that his visit
would further bring the outlooks of Iran and Malaysia closer.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said high-level changes can play an effective role in
coordinating the viewpoints of the two countries in their
decision-makings at international forums.
</P>
<P>
Praising Malaysian stances at regional and international
meetings for the benefit of Islam and the world of Islam, Nouri
said Iran is willing to boost ties and increase joint investment
with Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Revenue Collection May Be Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's revenue collection for
the current fiscal year ending June 30 may fall short of its
target of 196.24 billion taka (about 4.23 billion U.S. dollars) by
more than 14 billion taka (about 302 million dollars), or some 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from the non-tax sectors, such as state-run
enterprises, and financial and other institutions, could be
nearly 5 billion taka (about 108 million dollars) short of the
target, the Financial Express daily Saturday quoted the Finance
Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Profit and dividend earnings from state enterprises alone could
be 2.5 billion taka (about 54 million dollars) lower than the
target.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the shortfall in non-tax revenue
collection to low earnings from the transport and communications
sector, the losses suffered by the Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation, and the poor performance of most state-run financial
and industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And the shortfall in tax revenue collection was estimated at
9.44 billion taka (203.9 million dollars) in April this year.
Stagnation in economic activities, low imports, a fall in
industrial production and smuggling of foreign goods into the
country were partially responsible for the shortfall, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Due to the shortfall in revenue collection, the Finance
Ministry proposed a major cut in the country's development
expenditure, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Hopes to Talk with EU on Fish Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
reiterated its wish to hold dialog with the European Union (EU)
so as to compel the EU to cancel its ban on Mozambican fish
exports announced at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi disclosed this here
Friday, saying, "We should conduct constructive dialogs" in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
A cholera epidemic broke out in Mozambique last August. The
European Union announced to ban imports of Mozambican fish
products at the end of 1997, claiming the products did not meet
hygienic standards and might spread cholera to Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to Mocumbi, the World Health Organizations (WHO) has
checked on the fishing and freezing process in Mozambique, saying
it is unfair for the EU to cease fish imports from the country
citing the issue of cholera.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique harvests about 8,000 tons of prawns and over 10,000
tons of fish annually, with its export market mainly projected to
Europe. The EU ban on the country's sea products has resulted in
a reported loss of 240 million U.S. Dollars so far.

<HEADLINE> Record US Travelers Expected During Memorial Day Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 32 million Americans
were expected to take to the skies and highways during this
Memorial Day vocation starting Friday through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Friday was the busiest day in U.S. aviation history and return
flights Tuesday will be busy as well, the Air Transport
Association (ATA) said.
</P>
<P>
Overall travel should edge up one percent from last year's
Memorial Day weekend, with 26.7 million people expected to travel
more than 100 miles from home by car, and 5.4 million by air,
train or bus, the American Automobile Association said.
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Day, now officially observed on the last Monday in
May, has been set aside in most states of the United States for
observances in memory of dead members of the armed forces of all
wars. People usually travel during the three-day holiday weekend
before the Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
The ATA expected 12.5 million flight boardings over the weekend
while San Francisco International Airport warned passengers to
leave their cars at home as parking lots filled up early.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ron Wilson said the airport handled about 120,000
passengers Friday -- its busiest day since opening in 1926.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that a robust economy and low fuel prices are the
major factors that spur record American travelers to jam highways
and airports.
</P>
<P>
Travel industry officials warned vacationers to anticipate
crowds and delays.
</P>
<P>
"Things are going to be crowded and there are going to be
lines. I think a majority of people going places this weekend
recognize that this is going to be one of the busiest weekends
ever, a weekend to rival the busiest Thanksgiving," said James
Ashurst, spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Okays $3.9 Million for ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed to
provide 3.9 million U.S. Dollars to help the Nigerian-led west
African peace keeping force ECOMOG to check rebel atrocities
against civilians in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the large inflow of refugees from Sierra Leone and
rebel atrocities against innocent civilians, the U.S. State
Department has approved the immediate provision of 3.9 million
Dollars as assistance for ECOMOG operations," the Daily Times
Saturday quoted a report reaching here as saying.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG drove the military junta out of the capital Freetown in
mid-February for the reinstatement of the legitimate government
of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, ousted in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force has since claimed control of all the
district capitals in Sierra Leone while remnants of the junta
forces and allied rebels fled to the north and east to engage in
a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
However, ECOMOG and allies have been unable to stem a campaign
of terror waged by the junta remnants and rebel allies, who have
recently been killing and maiming civilians mainly in the north,
leaving hundreds of civilians mutilated.
</P>
<P>
Many local villagers have fled to neighboring Guinea to keep
off the atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Wins Satellite Telecommunication Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Motorola has been chosen to
replace Boeing as the lead builder of an ambitious billion-dollar
satellite telecommunications project.
</P>
<P>
Teledesic, the "Internet-in-the-sky" project, plans to launch
288 satellites in low earth orbit to provide high-speed Internet
access, video, voice and digital services from modern cities to
villages worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It has been among the most watched satellite projects since the
cellular pioneer Craig McCaw and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
announced their plans in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Boeing was hired last year to lead the project expected to cost
at least 9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Boeing will remain a partner, promising to complete its
investment of 100 million dollars. The company reportedly had
disputes over the project's cost.
</P>
<P>
A key reason for picking Motorola is its experience in building
the Iridium system, a network of 66 satellites that will offer
cellular-telephone service around the world.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, now as Teledesic's partner, will abandon its own
plans for Celestri, another high-speed computer system targeted at
Teledesic's market.
</P>
<P>
The company is investing 750 million dollars in cash and
technology for the Celestri project.
</P>
<P>
Teledesic's plans are considered the most ambitious of several
communications-satellite projects, requiring the integration of
advanced space and communications technology, while trying to
mass-produce satellites at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Gates and McCaw still each own significant portions of
Teledesic. Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, a wealthy individual
businessman, invested 200 million dollars in the project last
month.

<HEADLINE> Polls Begin in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Basotho people
braved the chilly morning weather Saturday to queue for the
mountain kingdom's third democratic general elections since its
independence in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. and will close at 5 p.m,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
At the Phetahatso Medium School in Mohalalitoe near capital
Maseru -- one of the more than 2,000 polling stations countrywide
-- about 1,000 people were on the queue by 5.30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
They had made a fire to ward off the cold weather while
election officials inside the polling station enjoyed warmth from
a heater.
</P>
<P>
Twelve political parties and 31 independent candidates will be
participating in the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
There were speculations that the opposition Basotho National
Party (BNP), which ruled Lesotho for the first two decades of its
independence, would win the polls in the tiny and often
politically troubled kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Although no formal opinion surveys have been done, indirect
indications, such as turnout at elections rallies, suggested that
the BNP will win, a South African media report said.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Prices Surge on Dry Weather Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Cotton prices increased sharply
Friday for fear of dry weather in the high plains of Texas, said
reports reaching here from the New York Cotton Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The cotton for July delivery settled 1.41 cents higher at 67.99
cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
The main reason behind the increase, analysts say, is the dry
weather fear. 1.4 million acres of non-irrigated cotton land near
Lubbock, Texas, has had very little rain this month and the
forecast is not promising.
</P>
<P>
Farmers will start planting in the next 10 days whether there
will be rain or not, but the forecast gives a little hope for rain
in the next few days.

<HEADLINE> SADC Regional Sports Policy Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon
Muzenda has called on SADC countries to set up a regional
physical education, sport and recreation policy to be preceded by
national policies in various member states.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda said such policies must include specific sport
development in schools as well as programs for out-of-school
youths, The Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sports development aimed at young people in primary and
secondary schools should be the backbone of sports development in
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and all 14
member states should ensure that women sports programs were given
adequate resources, Muzenda said.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a meeting of ministers of culture,
information and sport which ended in Harare Friday.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda also called on the SADC countries to enact laws that
prevent copyrights and effective piracy control to promote viable
cultural industries.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also urged the media to be objective when
reporting sports and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
"I urged the press to report extensively about cultural news
from the Southern African Development Community member states and
other regions in Africa," he said, adding, "this will enable our
people to feel that they are able to free themselves from bondage
of underdevelopment in terms of culture."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment too much emphasis is being put on covering what
is happening in Europe and America," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Muchanga, chairman of the Committee of Ministers of
Culture, Information and Sport and Mozambican Minister of
Culture, Information and Sport, said the meeting was aimed at
fostering regional integration and strengthening the region's
resolve to work together toward a common future.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Blames Weather for Gloomy Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Both drought and the El Nino rains
are to blame for stopping economic recovery in Kenya, Minister
for Planning and National Development George Saitoti has said.
</P>
<P>
The first half of last year was characterized by drought while
the end of the year was affected by the El Nino rains, he was
quoted Saturday by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another setback is heavy spending on the general election held
at the end of last year, the minister said in the report named
"1998 Economic Survey" issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
Together they reduced the growth in gross domestic product
(GDP) to only 2.3 percent against a projected growth of five
percent, disrupting the economic recovery starting in 1994, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He reported a fall in all the key sectors of the economy, led
by agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Farmers bought 14 percent less fertilizer and other chemicals,
and grew less food which caused famine in some areas, forcing the
government to declare disaster zones.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from tourism fell by 11.6 percent. The industry was
depressed in terms of both tourist arrivals, hotel occupancy,
game park entries and income generated.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, building and transport recorded significant
drops as a result of the collapse of the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The value of manufacturing output grew by 1.9 percent compared
to 3.7 percent in 1996, but due to a reduction in import duties
and improved performance by the Export Processing Zones and the
expanding regional market, the sector was cushioned.
</P>
<P>
The poor state of the roads led to increased costs for the
transport industry where output fell to 5.2 percent last year
from 14.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Areas that recorded growth were banking, pipeline transport,
the media and capitalization of the Nairobi Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Information and media activities recorded commendable
performance following increased sales of radios and television
sets.
</P>
<P>
Market capitalization based on the number of shares and the
prevailing market price increased from 98 million Shillings
(about 1.75 million U.S. Dollars) in 1996 to 114 million
Shillings (1.9 million Dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On internal trade, Saitoti said the overall balance of payment
deteriorated. While import volumes rose, exports stagnated,
resulting in a current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, he projected a marginally higher growth rate for
1998, saying the government will maintain a tight fiscal policy
to achieve a reduced budget deficit. The new budget will be
issued on June 11.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Start Returning Home From Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Only two days after Indonesia's
new president was sworn in, flights to Jakarta were mostly full as
Singapore hotel guests escaping Indonesia's violence were checking
out to return, travel industry sources confirmed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's flights to Jakarta already packed, travel agents
said that the trend is extending further into next week.
</P>
<P>
"The next available seats are on Wednesday," a ticket agent for
Garuda, an Indonesia airlines, was quoted by local television as
saying. Basically, people are slowly starting to go back, a hotel
manager observed.
</P>
<P>
Singapore hotels experienced an unexpected boom in business in
mid-May when thousands of expatriates and ethnic Chinese
Indonesians fled violence in various cities in Indonesia,
particularly the capital city of Jakarta. The violence was
reported to have left more than 500 dead.
</P>
<P>
The exodus during the turmoil sent Singapore hotels occupancy
rates increasing to between 90 to 100 percent, well above the
average earlier in the year. Now some hotel managers are expecting
occupancy rates at their hotels to gradually fall back to around
70 percent, or even lower.
</P>
<P>
While some of the ethnic Chinese Indonesians who fled were
returning to Indonesia, some others said they were checking out
from hotels to look for apartments in Singapore to stay longer,
one hotel manager said.
</P>
<P>
As for expatriates who were leaving, not everyone is heading
back to Indonesia. It was said only the breadwinners were
returning to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Besides, according to a television report, many of those
expatriates who were returning to Indonesia had tickets to
Singapore in case violence re-erupts.

<P>
This is the second operation of the transmission and
distribution division of Rolls-Royce in China. The first, Fushun
Reyrolle Bushing Company in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
is already operational.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce also has a joint venture with Xi'an Aero Engine
Corp. in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. It manufactures
components for Rolls-Royce engines.
</P>
<P>
The first delivery of components came 10 months after the new
factory broke ground. And the products are to be assembled in the
United Kingdom where Rolls-Royce headquarters is.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Behind U.S. Base Blast: Saudi Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's interior
minister has ruled out foreign involvement in a 1996 bombing that
killed 19 U.S. servicemen, saying Saudis were behind the incident,
Saudi newspaper Arab Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bombing "took place at Saudi hands," the minister, Prince
Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz, was quoted as telling a group of Kuwaiti
newspaper editors visiting the kingdom headed by Kuwaiti
Information Minister Yousef Mohammad Al-Sumait Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that this statement is apparently aimed at
ruling out Iranian involvement, previously suggested by western
media reports, in the truck bombing of a U.S. military complex in
the eastern Saudi town of Khobar two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister's comments could boost Saudi and U.S. efforts
towards improving ties with regional heavyweight Iran after years
of tension, they said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been improving
since Mohammad Khatami became Iran's president last August. There
have also been signs of improvement in relations between Iran and
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, Nayef said Saudi authorities would
announce the results of the Khobar bombing once the probe was
completed, but Saudi Arabia refused to implicate Iran in the
blast.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Endorsed as Member of ASEAN Regional Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the
political and security forum of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), is likely to absorb Mongolia as a new member, the
Philippine News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary
Lauro Baja, who chaired the just-concluded two-day ARF Senior
Officials Meeting here, as saying they had endorsed the admission
of Mongolia into the forum.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to recommend the admission of Mongolia into the ARF.
The ARF foreign ministers will make the final decision when they
meet in Manila next July," Baja said.
</P>
<P>
Baja said the decision to endorse Mongolia's bid to join the
ARF is consonant with the forum's desire to concentrate on
countries within the ARF's geographic footprint.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mongolia formally applied to join the ARF
when its foreign minister visited the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The ARF groups the nine ASEAN members, namely Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand,
Singapore and Vietnam, and their dialogue partners including
Australia, Canada, China, Japan, India, South Korea, New Zealand,
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Two other countries, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, enjoy
observer status in the forum. Cambodia will be formally integrated
into the ARF once it is officially admitted into the ASEAN, most
likely before the year ends, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines currently chairs the ASEAN, and in the same
capacity, will chair this year's ARF Foreign Ministerial Meeting
scheduled to be held here from July 27 to 29 this year.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia is firmly opposed to the
United States' attempt to spread its sphere of influence to
countries of the former Soviet Union, Deputy Foreign Minister
Georgy Mamedov said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the State Duma, or the Lower House of the
Parliament, about a report submitted by a U.S. senior official to
a U.S. senate committee on U.S. foreign policy in Outer Caucasus,
the Caspian Sea and Central Asia, Mamedov said the U.S. action
"was unacceptable," the Itar Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mamedov said that one of the priorities in Russia's foreign
policy was to develop relations with Outer Caucasus and Central
Asian countries, adding it was its main task to further strengthen
ties with these countries.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not seek confrontation in the region, but will
protect its own interests there because the region concerns
Russia's security and territorial integrity," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Voicing serious concern over the
actual design behind the five nuclear tests last week,
Calcutta-based intellectuals, scientists and human rights groups
have written a letter to the Chief Justice of India to stay any
further nuclear explosion by the Indian government, The Indian
Express said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
in a recent nine-page letter to the Chief Justice of India, the
Scientific Workers' Forum and other organizations also urged the
Chief Justice to stay all official propaganda of the government of
India in support of the test, nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
The letter requested the Chief Justice to compel the government
to disclose all the facts regarding the nuclear tests and
compensate the people for the damages caused because of the
nuclear tests carried out in 1974 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Indian government is trying to suppress the data
and factual information regarding the preparation and the tests.
</P>
<P>
The tests have actually resulted in a shift of policy from
India's anti-nuclear policy. The present government's action went
absolutely against the people's fundamental right of to life and
personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution of India, the
letter said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promises to Join Treaty Banning Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday
promised to join the international treaty banning land mines by
2006, but determined to develop alternate weapons.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced at a Friday concluded international
conference on land mines convened by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
It said it would destroy by 1999 all non-self destructing
anti-personnel land mines, except for those needed for South
Korea. The U.S. will end the use of all such land mines outside
South Korea by 2003, including those that self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. will aggressively pursue the objective of
having alternatives to anti-personnel land mines ready for South
Korea by 2006, including those that self-destruct. It will also
search aggressively for alternatives to mixed anti-tank systems.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Pentagon has no fielded alternatives to land
mines at present, but it has requested 4.7 million U.S. dollars in
the fiscal 1999 budget to search for them.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press said in a report that one possibility was
a weapon that would temporarily disable an approaching enemy, but
not kill. Another involves sensors that warn of an opponent's
approach and then trigger weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had previously refused to sign the treaty banning land
mines, claiming that such weapons are needed on the Korean
peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Thai AD Agencies Hard Hit by Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's advertising industry has
been hard hit by the economic crisis as nearly 10 percent of the
employees have lost their jobs and many local agencies have ceased
operations or downsized, the Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local agencies have closed down after failing to attract
clients or foreign partners, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the estimation of Witawat Jayapani, a senior
director of Ogilvy + Mather (Thailand) LTD, one of Thailand's
largest advertising agencies, there were about 10,000 people in
the local industry in more than 200 advertising companies.
</P>
<P>
Advertising companies in Thailand are facing difficulties as
local corporate clients have cut their advertising spending by
over 40 percent in response to the economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Local advertising agents said forming an alliance with foreign
advertising firms is now the solution for local agencies to
survive.
</P>
<P>
Among the major benefits enjoyed by local agencies forming an
alliance with foreign partners is the acquisition of
multi-national clients as well as access to international
resources and information, they said.
</P>
<P>
Witawat also suggested small and medium-sized agencies lift
their client service standards to survive, while big firms make
their prices more competitive when maintaining high standards of
service.

HAVANA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has fulfilled the World Health
Organization (WHO) target of eliminating leprosy by the year 2000
and is now in the "post-elimination phase," Cuban Health Ministry

</P>
<P>
The prevalent rate of leprosy in the island country stands as
low as under one per 10,000 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Of the 662 existing cases, 85 percent were diagnosed
in a precocious stage of affection and therefore are free of
sequelae, added the sources.
</P>
<P>
The therapeutic plan proposed by the WHO is carried out in Cuba

<HEADLINE> 40 Million Children Homeless in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 22 (Xinhua) -- There are some 40 million
children at a world level who live in deplorable conditions in the
streets, the non-government organization Free the Children said
Friday in Monterrey, north Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Craigh Kielburger, the founder of the organization, said in a
press communique that of the total, some 250,000 minors are forced
to work in conditions of abuse and bondage.
</P>
<P>
Kielburger asked young people to commit themselves to the
struggle for the rights and freedom of the children of the street.
</P>
<P>
He urged adult people to respect in a responsible manner the
rights of the minors who work in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Mexico signed an international agreement in 1990 for the
defense of the rights of the children, together with other 95
countries of the world, which must be complied with, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kielburger said that in developing countries such as Haiti or
Brazil, children, who are only four years old and learn to work,
are often lashed and carry machetes longer than themselves.
</P>
<P>
Some 110,000 Mexican children perform some kind of work in the
streets to contribute to the living of their families, according
to the National System for the Integral Development of the Family
(DIF) of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The figure was obtained from a study jointly made with the
United Nations Organization for the Children (UNICEF), DIF General
Director Mario Fuentes Alcala said during a working tour of the
states located in the Yucatan Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that the DIF created programs of social
assistance which help the parents of the children to land a job
and improve the living conditions of the family.
</P>
<P>
Another important program applied by the DIF for the
development of the Mexican children is that of school lunches.
</P>
<P>
This program is applied in Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and
Yucatan states, which suffer high levels of malnutrition in
children population.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to See 20,000 Lose Jobs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20,000 Singapore
workers could lose their jobs this year as the regional financial
crisis runs its course, said National Trades Union Congress (NTUC)
chief and Minister without Portfolio Lim Boon Heng.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times reported Saturday that Lim told local Radio
Heart on Friday night that about 7,000 workers had been laid off
in the first quarter of this year alone, marking the highest
figure on record.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that indications so far seemed to suggest that
the figure for the second quarter would be "equally high."
</P>
<P>
"This is because of the effects of the currency turmoil in the
region. It has not yet stabilized," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that what happened in the past few months will
really bite in the second half of this year. And unfortunately, he
said, the prospects would be for more retrenchments to come.
</P>
<P>
"We should expect that this year, the total number of jobs lost
through retrenchment will top 20,000," double the figure for last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that those who had lost their jobs might not
be able to find new jobs easily, even though 17,100 jobs had been
created in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, was because three-quarters of those retrenched
were manufacturing workers, whereas half of the new jobs were in
the construction industry, an area shunned by Singaporeans. The
other 4,000 new jobs were in financial services.
</P>
<P>
"So, clearly, there is a job mismatch. Manufacturing workers
cannot fit into the financial sector easily without a lot of
re-training," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
To stay employed, workers might have little choice but to take
up jobs which they had been unwilling to previously, such as
construction work, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Southeast European Nations Agree on Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Seven Southeastern European
countries signed here Friday a letter of intent on establishing a
multinational peacekeeping force in the region.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed at a deputy defense ministerial meeting
of seven participating countries -- Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia,
Greece, Italy, Romania and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The proposed force, a brigade 2,000 to 3,000 strong, will be
available for conflict prevention and other peacekeeping
operations under NATO or the Western European Union command with
the mandate of the United Nations or the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The document decided to create a standing headquarters, with a
rotating post of commander, for the brigade.
</P>
<P>
Joint exercises of troops from participating countries will be
held when necessary, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The document said the force is not aimed against any other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Friday's meeting also decided to promote exchanges of
information, visits of small military units and commanding
institutions and cooperation in other fields among the
participating countries within the framework of peaceful
partnership for peace.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from two observer countries -- the United States and
Slovenia -- and NATO and the OSCE also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Franklin Kramer, assistant secretary of defense of the United
States, said in a joint news conference after the meeting that the
force will not be deployed in Kosovo, the troubled province of the
Republic of Serbia in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The force was first proposed by Albania in October 1996 and
officially discussed in the Southeastern European defense
ministerial meeting held in Sofia, Bulgaria, last October.

<HEADLINE> Russian Authorities to Prosecute Gunmen in Dagestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin warned Friday that those responsible for inciting the
riots in Makhachkala, capital of Dagestan, would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
After attending a Dagestani National Council (local parliament)
meeting, Stepashin told reporters that he had had a talk with
Nadirshakh Khachilayev, a member of the Russian Duma and head of
Russia's Muslim Union, whose supporters Wednesday and Thursday
clashed with local police and seized the main government building
in Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen were killed and several others injured in the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
After several hours of negotiations, the Dagestani leadership
reached a deal with the gunmen. The rioters, afterward, withdrew
from the government building and Lenin Square was under police
control.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin moved quickly to try to defuse the crisis.
President Boris Yeltsin set up an emergency headquarters and asked
Stepashin, the interior minister, to cut short his Germany tour
and return to Moscow to take care of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who arrived in Makhachkala before dawn Friday, said
that Khachilayev has promised to try all efforts to prevent such a
rioting from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
Magomed Ali Magomedov, speaker of the Dagestani National
Council, said the Makhachkala incident was a "rebellion," which
brought Dagestan to the verge of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency reported Dagestani interior minister,
Magomed Abdurazakov, stepped down Friday and was replaced by
another ministry official, Adilgerey Magomedtagirov.
</P>
<P>
Dagestan, a mainly Moslem republic, lies between Chechnya and
the Caspian Sea.

<HEADLINE> Italian Minister Defends Abortion Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy's 1978 law legalizing abortion
has not led to a growth in abortions, Italian Social Affairs
Minister Livia Turco said in defense of the law on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The law, known as Law 194, was passed exactly 20 years ago.
Anti-abortion groups took the opportunity of Friday's anniversary
to stage protests demanding that the law be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Turco told reporters that "in the last 20 years, there has been
a dramatic and constant fall in the number of abortions."
</P>
<P>
"The law hasn't led to an increase in the number of abortions
because abortion has always existed. Obviously, a lot remains to
be done because abortion is still a traumatic experience for a
woman," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We should calculate the number of abortions carried out before
1978 and the number of women who died having illegal ones. Our
society is a lot more advanced today. I believe that the problem
of life needs to be discussed on another level."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that modifying the abortion law is the road to
pursue. Rather, we should be trying to help women who desire to be
mothers but find that they simply can't afford to have a child,"
Turco said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show a steady decline in the number of
legal abortions, from 235,000 in 1982 to 129,000 in 1996.

ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy's national soccer team head
coach Cesare Maldini said on Friday he wanted to know as quickly
as possible what the real chances were on the recovery of the
Juventus striker Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press at the opening of training for the
national side, Maldini said that he had already drawn up a
short-list of replacements for Del Piero: Gianfranco Zola, Enrico
Chiesa and Pierluigi Casiraghi. Francesco Totti, the new "golden
boy" of Italian soccer, was not on the list because of his lack of
international experience.
</P>
<P>
Calling in Roberto BAggio, he explained, was in reward for his
outstanding season, while Giuseppe Bergomi, veteran of Italy's
World Cup triumph in Spain '82, was called back to be part of the
second string with the full backing of the other defenders.
</P>
<P>
Del Piero will arrive at the national training camp at
Coverciano this evening for tests. A press conference will be
held after although no definitive decision is expected on his
chances for going to France next month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Orders Secret Service Employees to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge Friday
ordered three Secret Service employees to testify before a grand
jury investigating an alleged affair involving President Bill
Clinton and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson
rejected the Secret Service's contention that its agents deserved
a special "protective function privilege" to avoid testifying for
fear that they would lose the confidence of the president if they
revealed what they observed.
</P>
<P>
She dismissed the administration's arguments that compelling
testimony could result in agents being kept farther from the
president, heightening the likelihood of assassination.
</P>
<P>
Her ruling granted Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's motion
to compel two uniformed Secret Service officers and an agency
counsel to appear before the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
The administration still can appeal or change its legal
strategy to try to stop the agents from testifying.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, talking with reporters in the Rose Garden,
said of the ruling, "At least, it will have a chilling effect
perhaps on the conversations presidents have and the work that
they do and the way they do it," according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know if the Secret Service would appeal the
ruling. "I don't know because I'm not involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department and Secret Service said in a statement
that they were reviewing the decision and "continue to believe
that any action that could distance the Secret Service from the
president increases the danger to his life and that of future
presidents."

<HEADLINE> Official Says Interest Rates Cut will Help Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- China should lower the real
interest rates to achieve its target of 8 percent GDP growth this
year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
There is still room for further interest rate cuts, and high
real interest rates are the key reason for China's ever-declining
gross domestic product growth, today's China Daily quoted a
Chinese official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Xiao, an official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission, told the newspaper that real interest has kept rising
with inflation going downward since 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that the real interest rate for a one-year loan
computed on the basis of the retail price index, increased by 16
percentage points from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the real interest rate has surged up more than 20
percentage points since 1993 if computed on the basis of
producers' price index.
</P>
<P>
"Such high real interest rates mean substantial consumption and
borrowing costs for both households and firms," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that appropriate interest rate cuts will not affect the
stability of exchange rates because the renminbi yuan has been
under a certain pressure of appreciation as a result of sustained
net trade surpluses even amidst the financial crisis in East and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The official's view was also echoed by Song Guoqing, a Chinese
economist in Beijing University, who claimed that the nominal
interest rate can still be adjusted downward one or two percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
But the central government seems to lean more towards
increasing fiscal spending, another option for stimulating the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said that the central
government is ready to move 750 billion US dollars into
infrastructure building in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate should be of higher priority,
considering the declining GDP growth, Zhao said, who believed
further interest rate cuts seem to be necessary and possible as
well.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pleased with EU-U.S. Sanction Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy is pleased with the compromise
deal between the European Union and the United States that eases
restrictions on European businesses investing in Cuba, Iran and
Libya, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dini said at a cabinet meeting that the compromise, reached at
the EU-U.S. summit in London last Monday, was the result of "a
very firm and determined" intervention on the part of Europe, and
that Italy, too, was gathering the "fruit of its own lengthy
efforts" against the U.S. sanctions, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the U.S. Helms-Burton and D'Amato laws, which
penalizes European firms trading with Cuba, Iran and Libya, had
been "hotly contested" by the EU and had threatened to blight
economic relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Dini noted that it was Italy's insistence that pushed the
U.S. to include Libya in the compromise agreement, which was at
first applicable only to Iran and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the EU agreed to a series of restrictions on
high-technology and military exports to Iran and Libya while the
U.S. agreed to waive the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (also known as
the D'Amato law) and renounce sanctions against European companies
investing in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As for Cuba, the EU committed itself to not investing in
U.S. property confiscated by Cuba after the 1959 revolution and to
avoiding exports deemed contrary to U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
In return, the U.S. agreed to waive sanctions provided by the
Helms-Burton Law, which penalizes foreign firms investing in Cuban
property seized after the revolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Public Health Ministry
will launch a campaign on World Environment Day on June 5, in
which the public will be asked to help conserve 11 of the
country's rivers, including Chao Phraya river, according to Public
Health Permanent Secretary Prakrom Vuthipongse.
</P>
<P>
If nothing is done to prevent further deterioration, there
could be a shortage of water and this would affect households, the
Bangkok Post Saturday quoted Prakrom as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prakrom said community leaders, students, private sector firms,
and the state authorities would be urged to take joint
responsibility in cleaning up the rivers.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the Chao Phraya river is of most concern in
Bangkok because pollutants are continuously discarded into the
water.
</P>
<P>
The level of oxygen dissolved in the water is only 1-2
milligrams per liter, which means that the river water can be used
only for navigation.

<HEADLINE> Italy Suggests Unifying Three Rome-Based U.N. Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
suggested Friday that three Rome-based United Nations
organizations be merged into one central unit.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations the president talked about are the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Program (WFP)
and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (FAD).
</P>
<P>
In an address at the inauguration of the new WFP headquarters,
Scalfaro said his proposal was not only a logistical question, but
also a concrete demonstration of rationalizing the synergies of
these organizations while, at the same time, maintaining their
specific roles and targets.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations share the same goal for food security
and agricultural development, Scalfaro said, adding that after
merger they would see their clout grow within the United Nations
and the general costs reduced in view of already limited resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the WFP's efforts and abilities in handling
both emergencies and development, Scalfaro said, "the time has
come for actions more oriented toward prevention which work in a
structural way to ensure the continuity of available food."
</P>
<P>
The Italian head of state went on to stress the need to
modernize and make efforts more professional because "famine is a
vicious circle, humanity's greatest inhumanity."
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at today's inauguration were WFP Executive
Director Catherine Bertini and FAO Director Jacques Diouf.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia (BI), welcomed the decision of the new president to
separate the bank from the new cabinet line-up to assure its
independency.
</P>
<P>
"The independency will make the central bank easier in making
important decisions. It will be easy for BI to make decisions upon
monetary stability and not other considerations," BI Governor
Syahril Sabirin said here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie, when announcing the new cabinet Friday
morning, said he had not put he post of central bank governor into
the new cabinet formation as before because he wanted it
independent.
</P>
<P>
Many quarters said one of the factors that had helped cause the
fall of the rupiah (national currency) value so far was BI's
dependency.
</P>
<P>
Under the old system any decisions to be made by BI governor
had to be consulted first with the Minister of Finance and the
Monetary Board.
</P>
<P>
The Bureaucracy has made BI infertile and criticized as having
no sense of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Syahril Sabirin said BI's short-term program would be how to
stabilize the rupiah value.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah value has dropped by about 75 percent or from merely
2,400 against the U.S. dollar in July last to more than 10,000 per
dollar now.

<P>
LIMA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A woman dies every hour in Peru from
pregnancy complications, during labor, or after delivery.
</P>
<P>
Every year 8,760 women die here for lack of attention during
pregnancy or labor, Miriam Cruz Olave, representative of the
Panamerican Health Organization (PAHO), said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PAHO official, quoted by the press, said that 265 women die
for every 100,000 children born alive.
</P>
<P>
Also, of the one million pregnancies registered every year in
the country, almost 650,000 end with delivery, and 350,000 as
abortions, most of them induced.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the main causes of death are hemorrhages,
hypertension induced by pregnancy, infections during and after
labor in unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
The PAHO representative also attributed the death to abortion
practised in unsanitary conditions, prolonged delivery obstructed
by narrowness of the pelvis of the mother, or an unusual position
of the baby.
</P>
<P>
The official said that every year 50 million women across the
world suffer complications during pregnancy, delivery, or
postpartum, which causes the death of a woman every minute in the
the world.

<P>

may be regarded as an excellent example of good-neighbourly
friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation.

Jiang pointed out that social life is the sole source of
cultural and art creation, and going deep into life is an
important channel to glorify culture and art.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Large TV Producer to Merge Two Factories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Changhong Electronics Group, one of
China's largest TV producers, is seeking the merger of two
television set factories in east China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
The firm is now negotiating with Hitachi Fujian in Fuzhou,
capital of Fujian, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The plan for Hitachi Fujian's acquisition is Changhong's second
endeavour in the province. Changhong's President Ni Runfeng
visited Xiamen on May 3 for the possible acquisition of Xiahua,
another TV maker in the province.
</P>
<P>
Changhong, formerly a manufacturer of goods for the military,
is now producing goods for civil use, such as TV sets, air
conditioners, and other electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, its production was valued at 25.65 billion yuan,
accounting for 35 percent of China's color TV market.
</P>
<P>
This year, it plans to make nine million color TV sets and have
40 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Fujian is one of the earliest TV producers in China to
use Japanese technology. However, it has been in difficulty in
recent years.
</P>

CARACAS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the Venezuelan
crudes basket will close this year at 13 U.S. dollars per barrel,

"The Venezuelan crudes basket is a combination of crudes and

prices drop undergone in the recent days will affect us, but there
still is an expectation to close the year at a 13 dollar per

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen told the U.S. military on Friday to vaccinate all 2.4
million members of the armed forces against the deadly disease
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
Cohen approved a pilot anthrax vaccination program for troops
deployed in the Gulf area last December at a time when military
action against Iraq might have been imminent.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf War in 1991, the U.S. military has built up a
stockpile of more than six million doses. President Bill Clinton
on Friday called for stockpiling vaccines against biological
weapons attack.
</P>
<P>
"All conditions for implementing the anthrax vaccination
program have now been met," the Pentagon said in a statement,
quoting Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is usually an animal disease but it can infect humans
and is 99 percent lethal to unprotected individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said servicemen and women will take a series of
six inoculations over an 18-month period, followed by an annual
booster.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also announced on Friday plans to station specially
trained "rapid assessment" teams in 10 states for responding to
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls for Solidarity with Colonial Peoples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Friday that despite success in de-colonization,
there is still work to do in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a statement to the U.N. Special
Committee on de-colonization which met this morning to observe the
Week of Solidarity with the Peoples of All Colonial Territories
Fighting for Freedom, Independence and Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
In the 38 years since the adoption of the Declaration on the
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, some
60 former colonial territories inhabited by over 80 million people
have attained independence and joined the United Nations as
sovereign states, but the work for de-colonization remains
unfinished, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As we reach the final year of the International Decade for the
Eradication of Colonialism, we must redouble our efforts and see
this process to its conclusion," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are still 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories in the world
and the U.N. has been observing the Week of Solidarity since 1972.
This year the Week falls on May 25 till May 29.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned-Movement (NAM),
Colombia's representative Alvago Forero told the Committee that
the recent Ministerial Meeting of the NAM Coordinating Bureau
reaffirmed the principle of self-determination, irrespective of
the Territories' size.

<HEADLINE> Syria FM Expresses Optimism on Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, MAY 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara on Friday expressed little optimism on reviving the
deadlocked Middle East peace process because of Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
"There is not much optimism," Shara told reporters after his
talks with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
"I tell you frankly, although I didn't hear it directly from
the American side, it was obvious that the Israeli government
policy is the major factor in the deadlock in the peace process
which we witness now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 but
the negotiations broke off in early 1996 without making tangible
progress on two major issues -- the fate of the Golan Heights and
future ties between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
No talks have been held since right-wing Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu won an election in May 1996 and took office as the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the talks to resume from the point where they left
off, but Netanyahu, who opposes returning the Golan Heights to
Syria, wants to start talks anew.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to resume the talks from where we stopped,"
Shara reiterated on Friday.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Lebanon, both Damascus and Beirut rejected
Israel's proposal for withdrawal from south Lebanon on the
condition that Lebanese army takes control of the area and
prevents guerrilla attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria ad Lebanon say Israel should implement U.N. Resolution
425, passed in 1978, which calls for an unconditional pullback
of Israel's 35,000 troops. And Shara also reaffirmed the Syrian
position on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Polls Close on N.Irish Peace Deal with High Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- All the polls closed at 2200 on
Friday (2100 GMT) in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic for
the referendum on the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The voting underwent peacefully with a heavy turnout on both
sides of the border. An estimated 80 percent of the Northern Irish
electorate had cast their ballots, according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
In some areas of the province, queues formed outside polling
stations even before they opened. Nearly four million people --
1.2 million in the North and 2.8 million in the south -- were
eligible to cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which decides the fate of Northern Ireland,
marked the first all-Ireland poll in 80 years.
</P>
<P>
Chief Electoral Officer Pat Bradley, who is running the vote in
Northern Ireland, said figures from a polling station in Belfast
indicated a final turnout in excess of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It's been very consistent and persistent," he said, adding
that the result would be expected by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
If the peace agreement is endorsed by the voters on both sides
of the border, it will pave the way for a new Northern Ireland
assembly designed to secure a say for both the Protestant majority
and the 40 percent Roman Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal, Northern Ireland will remain in Britain
while building closer ties with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
There has been no reports of any incidents so far. Police
officers -- some clutching Heckler and Koch assault rifles --
patrolled in and near polling stations in case of attacks by
dissident groups opposed to the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Voting was also brisk in the Irish republic, where the
electorate was being asked to drop its historical constitutional
claim on the six northern counties, according to reports from
Dublin, the Irish capital.

<HEADLINE> House of Representatives Debates Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Friday started debating campaign finance
legislation, with one side criticizing the huge spending on
federal elections and the other countering that the bills under
consideration would violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The debate suspended after two hours and will be resumed when
lawmakers return after a weeklong holiday recess starting
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This debate will clearly identify those members who support
real bipartisan reform... from those who are tied to the status
quo," said Representative Marty Meehan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Meehan and Republican Representative Christopher Shays
co-sponsored a bipartisan bill to ban "soft money," -- unregulated
campaign donations to national and state parties from
corporations, labor unions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Shays-Meehan proposal is supported by many members of the
Senate, where a Republican filibuster derailed nearly identical
campaign finance legislation last Winter. President Bill Clinton
and some consumer groups also back the bill.
</P>
<P>
When the House reconvenes next month, debate is expected to
focus initially on a competing proposal drafted by a bipartisan
group of first-termers. The bill would ban "soft money" at the
federal level only, increase contribution limits and require
additional disclosures from outside groups.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the reform said that the issue is really about
free speech, and that limiting the amount of money in campaigns
would restrict that cherished constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
But Representative Asa Hutchinson, a Republican and a leading
sponsor of the freshmen bill, countered that reform opponents were
waging a "misinformation campaign" about the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
"By claiming to argue for free speech, the opponents of reform
are cynically attempting to make sure that big money not only
talks but it screams," he said.
</P>
<P>
The national political parties raised 67.4 million dollars in
"soft money" in 1997, the biggest amount of "soft money" ever
raised in an off-election year, according to a recent analysis by
Common Cause, a public interest group that supports the
Shays-Meehan bill. Republicans raised nearly 50 percent more than
Democrats during the period, 40.4 million dollars compared with 27
million dollars, according to the Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders of the House of Representatives oppose curbs
on campaign spending, but agreed to debate the issue a second time
this year under intense pressure from rank-and-file members.
</P>
<P>
"What they really are doing is trying to hide behind the First
Amendment," said Ann McBride, executive director of Common Cause.
"This is not a debate about free speech. It's a debate about very
expensive speech from very huge contributions flooding the
system."

<HEADLINE> OAU Stresses Peace Solution to Ethio-Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
said Friday that only a peaceful resolution of the border dispute
between Ethiopia and Eritrea based on dialogue and negotiation
can be a real solution.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion cerebrating the 35th birthday
of the OAU, Salim said that "the on-going crisis between Ethiopia
and Eritrea is a matter of grave concern to us."
</P>
<P>
Salim pointed out that the dispute "constitutes a setback to
the commendable efforts made by the leaders of the two countries,
and to the other leaders in the region, to bring about peace,
security, stability and development."
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is my earnest hope that wisdom will prevail
and that both parties will do their utmost to avoid an escalation
of the crisis and to seek a peaceful solution to it."
</P>
<P>
"The alternative of escalation can only spell disaster for the
peoples of Ethiopia and Eritrea as well as for the region as a
whole," Salim said, adding that "Africa, which has been
strengthened by the stability and understanding and cooperation
between these two sister states can only be seriously undermined
if the crisis is allowed to escalate."
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, in our collective interest to spare no
effort to find a peaceful solution to this unfortunate dispute,"
Salim added.
</P>
<P>
It is recalled that on May 18, Salim strongly appealed to the
leadership of Ethiopia and Eritrea to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis and to do their utmost to avoid a further escalation
of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Demand Falls 55 pct in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- World gold demand fell by 55 percent
in the first three months of this year as a result of Asia's
economic crisis, the first significant fall in gold consumption in
six years, according to a latest survey by the World Gold Council
(WGC).
</P>
<P>
The council's quarterly Gold Demand Trend survey showed that
gold demand in the three months to the end of March fell to 342.1
tons or 11 million troy ounces, the first big fall since the
survey began in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The council, which monitors 21 countries accounting for about
80 percent of global demand, said in its survey that the Asian
financial crisis helped slash demand for gold in developing Asian
countries by 70 percent during the first quarter of this year
compared with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It said that Indonesian gold demand crashed by 152 percent in
the first quarter against the same period last year, South Korean
demand down by 723 percent, Malaysian by 80 percent and in Japan,
demand fell by 40 percent, followed by Singapore's 28 percent
drop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumers in Asian countries have dumped over 268
tons of gold coins, jewellery and other bullion on world markets
in the first quarter, nearly 10 percent of total annual world
demand, in an effort to help their countries to pay off some of
their debts.
</P>
<P>
Patriotic South Koreans alone handed over 228 tons of gold to
their government in the state-sponsored "save the nation" gold
collections movement.
</P>
<P>
Indonesians also sold a net 64 tons of gold to the world
market, some times to buy necessities after the value of their
domestic currency collapsed.
</P>
<P>
This contributed to drive down the price of the precious metal
to a 18.5-year low of 276.50 U.S. dollars an ounce on January 13
from about 417 U.S. dollars in February last year.
