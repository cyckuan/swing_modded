<HEADLINE> Cemented Yangtze Breach Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River breach at
Jiujiang in east China's Jiangxi Province remains effective since
being cemented together yesterday afternoon, according to the
latest reports.
</P>
<P>
The newly repaired embankment is some 1.2 meters higher than
the Yangtze water level, which dropped to 22.62 meters at 8 pm
this evening, 0.06 meters lower than at the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many soldiers and civilians are still working to further
fortify the trapezium-shaped cemented breach, 4 meters wide on
top, 25 meters at the base, and nearly 100 meters long, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The water flow rate at the breach was 400 cubic meters per
second on Friday when the embankment was torn, but now there is
only some seeping.
</P>
<P>
Experts are now working to wipe out the seepage completely, and
expect this to be accomplished in three days.
</P>
<P>
However, receding floodwaters may easily cause embankment
collapses and landslides, so greater efforts are urgently needed
to keep alert for any possible weak point along the Yangtze dikes,
experts warned.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Involvement in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday denied its
involvement in the Islamic Taliban's recent military offensives
against their rivals in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically reject allegations of Pakistan's involvement
in the current situation in Afghanistan," the Foreign Office said
in a press release Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that the government-controlled print and
electronic media in some countries have been utilized in an
orchestrated campaign of vilification against Pakistan," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a lesson of history that the Afghans have never
tolerated outside interference in their internal affairs," it
said, adding that Pakistan considers the military fortunes or
misfortunes of any particular group or faction as purely an
internal affair of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest hope that the countries sharing borders with
Afghanistan, instead of raising alarms over a non-existent threat
will join Pakistan in promoting peace and harmony in that
beleaguered country," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the Afghan conflict, Pakistan has followed a
principled, upright and transparent policy," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It has offered its fullest cooperation and has supported all
efforts including those of the U.N. and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference to bring peace to Afghanistan. We shall remain
steadfast to this policy," it said.
</P>
<P>
In their latest attempt to take over the whole Afghanistan, the
hard-line Taliban militia on Saturday overran Mazar-e-Sharif,
headquarters of the rival Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Then they proceeded to take Taloqan, a strategic base of the
opposition alliance in Takhar Province, on Tuesday, and
Pul-i-Khumri and Nahrin in Baghlan Province on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Iran and the Afghan opposition have accused Pakistan of
giving military aid to the Taliban.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Members of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and opposition party
supporters clashed outside King Letsie III's palace in Maseru
Thursday, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted police spokesman Sekoateng Serabeli as saying that
about 1,000 LCD members marched at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) to the
palace, where hundreds of opposition party members have camped
since last Tuesday in protest against the May general election
results.
</P>
<P>
Serabeli said fighting erupted when the LCD members confronted
the protesters.
</P>
<P>
"After a while LCD supporters ran away and gunshots were
heard, but it is not yet known who fired them," Serabeli said.
</P>
<P>
There were unconfirmed reports that two people were shot.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted an unnamed palace source as saying that Letsie was
deeply worried about the unrest.
</P>
<P>
"The king is deeply worried, unfortunately he cannot take
sides," said the source.
</P>
<P>
"The constitution does not allow him to intervene. He cannot
take sides."
</P>
<P>
Opposition party members claim that the election was rigged in
favor of the LCD, which took 79 of 80 seats in the National
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Decline in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A large drop in auto sales
caused by the General Motors strike in July produced the worst
decline in retail sales in 15 months, the Commerce Department
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales plunged 0.4 percent from the previous month, to a
seasonally adjusted 224.7 billion U.S. dollars, after rising just
0.1 percent in June, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales dropped 3 percent, to 59 billion dollars, also the
worst decrease since April 1997. Except the auto sales, all other
retail goods picked up 0.5 percent as compared with a 0.1 percent
dip in June, in line with the average so far this year.
</P>
<P>
In July, sales of big-ticket durable goods thrived. Furniture
stores reported a 1.2 percent increase and building-supply and
hardware stores, 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 0.7 percent at clothing and accessory shops, 0.6
percent at drug stores, 0.4 percent at gas stations, 0.3 percent
at food stores and 0.2 percent at department stores. However, they
fell 0.4 percent at restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report released here Thursday, the Labor
Department said the number of Americans filing first-time
applications for unemployment benefits slipped by 7,000 last week
to a seasonally adjusted 301,000.
</P>
<P>
That was down from 394,000 for two consecutive weeks in late
June and early July, when tens of thousands of GM strikers filed
claims.
</P>
<P>
However, consumers have continued spending briskly because jobs
remain plentiful and income is rising and because, even with
recent drops, stock portfolios reflect large accumulated gains.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Inspects Floods-Ravaged Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- All of the country's forces
should make continued and concerted efforts to support civilians
and soldiers who are standing on the flood-fighting front lines
until a final victory is achieved, President Jiang Zemin urged
today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and
chairman of the Central Military Commission, pointed out that
flood-fighting on the Yangtze River has reached a crucial
moment when problems may easily appear and carelessness is
liable to cause huge losses.
</P>
<P>
He said that outstanding achievements have already been made in
fighting the raging floods in Fujian, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei,
Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia
since mid-June.
</P>
<P>
During the unprecedented struggle against the Yangtze floods, a
large number of civilians and soldiers have scored a vital victory
by defending the levee for more than 40 days and withstanding five
flood crests, he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang demanded that leaders at all levels place
great importance on the flood-fighting effort and give it top
priority, and told them they are all responsible for the effort.
</P>
<P>
Each locality and concerned department and forces from
everywhere should firmly obey orders from the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army should play the role of shock
troops, overcoming fatigue and sharpening vigilance to make new
contributions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called for timely efforts to evacuate the people in
dangerous places and ensure they are provided with food, boiled
water, housing, and access to doctors, adding that attention must
be paid to epidemic prevention and public security.
</P>
<P>
Another task is to restore production and rebuild homes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that immediately after the flooding,
efficient measures will be taken to build water-control facilities
and raise the capacity for flood prevention.
</P>
<P>
Water control efforts are very important for maintaining social
order and invigorating the nation. Floods, a hidden trouble
threatening the lives, property and safety of the people, should
arouse high concern from the whole Party, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On his journey from Xiantao City to Wuhan this morning, Jiang
also inspected two perilous sections, Longwangmiao and
Yueliangwan, on the embankment of the Yangtze in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Jiang were Wen Jiabao, vice-premier of the State
Council and head of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters; Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission; and Zeng Qinghong, director of the General Office of
the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> China Recovers Remains of Nanjing Massacre Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
Nanjing City Government in eastern Jiangsu Province today
announced the recovery of the remains of 35 people who were proven
to be victims of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre committed by the
Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
The remains, which were found during excavations by the Nanjing
Jiangdongmen Museum in Nanjing earlier this year, include the
skeletons of 16 males, 7 females, 7 children and 5 which are
unidentified.
</P>
<P>
Scientific analysis shows that those people died 60 years ago,
at the time of the Nanjing Massacre. The youngest victim was 6
years old and the oldest was more than 60. Wounds and injuries
were found on some of remains.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents reveal that the area around the
Jiangdongmen Museum was used as a killing ground when the Japanese
committed the massacre in December 1937. More than 10,000 people
were killed at that time.
</P>
<P>
At today's news briefing, Qiu Ronggui, a 84-year-old survivor
of the Nanjing Massacre, denounced the crimes committed by the
Japanese invaders by telling what he saw around the Jiangdongmen
area 61 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangdongmen Museum has decided to keep the remains in
order to remind people of this history.

<HEADLINE> All Services at New HK Airport Return to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- All services at the new Hong
Kong International Airport which was commenced on July 6 this year
were approaching a high level of efficiency, the Airport Authority
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL), the main air
cargo franchisee, announced on Thursday its resumption of all
outbound and inbound air cargo services at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
This means that full air cargo operations are being conducted,
although HACTL will continue to process cargo at both Super
Terminal 1 at the new airport and Terminal 2 at Kai Tak, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Partial cargo handling services were once suspended because
there appeared some problems after the new airport at Chek Lap Kok
started its operation on July 6 this year. So the Terminal 2 at
Kai Tak had to be used again.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority said that HACTL expects to transfer all
operations to Super Terminal 1 by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
It said that passenger services throughout the past week
continued to maintain levels of efficiency equal to or better than
at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures given by the Airport Authority,
three quarters of flights were leaving on time or within 15
minutes of schedule. Almost all arriving passengers were clearing
immigration within 15 minutes, and the average waiting time for
their baggages was 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"The figures show that the new Hong Kong International Airport
is achieving levels of efficiency," said Clinton Leeks, corporate
development director of the Airport Authority.

<HEADLINE> Half Asylum Seekers in UK Detained in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of asylum seekers and
immigration detainees in Britain are being held in jails rather
than at specialist detention centers, according to new figures
released Friday by the Prison Reform Trust.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the detainees are in unsuitable conditions in jail
while detention centers are often of a poor standard, the trust
report revealed.
</P>
<P>
Prison Reform Trust director Stephen Shaw said imprisoning
asylum seekers have betrayed the "proud tradition" of the country
of helping those fleeing persecution abroad.
</P>
<P>
"By definition, a prison cannot be a suitable place to detain
someone not convicted of -- nor even suspected of -- a criminal
offense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaw also said sending asylum-seekers to prison was
"inappropriate, inconsistent and inhumane," and called for new
immigration detention centers to be built.
</P>
<P>
The trust report showed that in February alone, 427 asylum
seekers -- nearly half of all those in detention -- were held in
Prison Service custody.
</P>
<P>
Although the decision on whether to jail asylum seekers was
supposedly made on whether they were likely to be particularly
disruptive, in practice they were usually sent wherever there was
room.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that asylum seekers detained in prison
were likely to have less time out of their cells and fewer
opportunities for education.
</P>
<P>
They were often forced to wear "old, ill-fitting and culturally
inappropriate" clothing and suffered from inadequate communication
facilities and limited visiting rights.
</P>
<P>
The report also criticized specialist, privately-run detention
centers by highlighting their lack of adequate leisure facilities
including their libraries' poor stocks of foreign language books.
</P>
<P>
A recent White Paper on immigration and asylum said the
government was looking into ways of expanding the number of places
available outside jail.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday welcomed a
decision by the ethnic Albanian leadership in Yugoslavia's
troubled province of Kosovo to resume talks with Yugoslav
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a news release the move is
the result of coordinated efforts by the international community,
above all the Contact Group, which stands for a political
settlement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Russia urged Yugoslavia, Serbia and the Kosovo Albanian
community "to start negotiations immediately and without any
preliminary conditions, and to show maximum restraint in avoiding
any hostile action that could endanger the talks."
</P>
<P>
Ibranhim Rugova, the main Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader, named
a five-person delegation, on Friday, to re-start suspended peace
talks with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, seeking independence from Belgrade and
integration into neighboring Albania, boycotted the talks in March
and they were suspended in June.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the ethnic Albanian delegation and Belgrade will
discuss all aspects of the planned settlement of the conflict,
including the region's future status.
</P>
<P>
Russia also hoped the Contact Group, acting in a coordinated
way, would continue to render Belgrade and Pristina, capital of
Kosovo, all necessary assistance in conducting the negotiation
process, the release said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200,000 people have been displaced from their
homes and farms in Kosovo since February when fighting began
between ethnic Albanians and Serb police.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Condemns Taliban for Holding Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Friday strongly condemned
Afghanistan's Taliban forces for holding 11 Iranian staff members
at the Iranian Consulate in Mazari-e-Sharif and a reporter since
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry urged the Taliban
forces not to prevent foreigners who want to leave Afghanistan
from departing, saying that Turkey expects the Taliban forces to
set free the Iranian diplomats and the reporter with the official
Iranian news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey condemns all kinds of terrorist activities such as
holding civilians hostage," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran earlier said the Taliban forces captured the Iranian
diplomats and the IRNA correspondent residing in Mazari-e-Sharif,
the main stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance, on
Saturday when they took control of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban stated that they did not hold any Iranian
diplomats and the Iranian consulate general in Mazari-e-Sharif had
been evacuated when their forces reached.
</P>
<P>
Tehran argued that available evidence proved that the Iranian
diplomats and reporter were in the hands of the Taliban and were
transferred to Qandahar, the group's headquarters in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has accused the Taliban of violating international laws
and norms and held Pakistan, the Taliban's main supporter,
responsible for the safety and release of the Iranian diplomats.

<HEADLINE> UK's New Tax Scheme Procures Windfall But Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government has gained
a massive windfall from the introduction of a new self-assessment
tax payment scheme, but the sharp rise in tax receipts is
considered to have contributed to the slowdown in the UK economy.
</P>
<P>
Payments in the first two months of this year alone had risen
by 7.5 billion pounds (about 12 billion U.S. dollars), a massive
rise equivalent to raising the tax rate by over 3 percent. This
has prompted allegations that the government has implemented a
"secret" tax increase.
</P>
<P>
Amid a blaze of publicity last year, the British Revenue
introduced the new self-assessment scheme which, mainly applying
to self-employed workers and those on higher incomes, was designed
to shift the onus for assessing tax from the Revenue to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regime, late payers face strict deadlines for
payment and fines of at least 100 pounds if they are not met. The
harsh penalties for not filling in self-assessment forms have
encouraged people to pay their tax bills promptly, which has had
the effect of swelling the government's coffers.
</P>
<P>
The Inland Revenue has already fined more than three quarters
of a million people, raising 77.5 million pounds. It forecasts
issuing another 400,000 fines, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp rise in tax receipts has contributed to the
slowdown in the UK economy, as higher bills are likely to have
slowed the housing market and consumer spending, according to
economists.
</P>
<P>
BBC quoted James Barty, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, as
saying, "In particular the housing market and consumer spending
have been weaker than people thought they would be. I suspect that
this hidden tax increase, as it were, has had the effect of
slowing the economy."

<HEADLINE> Fifth Flood Crest Brings No Hike in Wuhan's Water Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The fifth flood crest of the
Yangtze River this season is passing Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province, without causing a rise in the local water
level.
</P>
<P>
Though the water flow increased from 65,600 cubic meters per
second to 65,900 cubic meters per second, the water level dropped
0.01 meters from 2:00 pm to 8:00 pm, according to a local source.
</P>
<P>
Dike breaches and flood-diverting efforts have increased the
capacity for water accumulation, and the water surface of this
section is also broadening, bringing about the decreased water
level, according to water control experts.
</P>
<P>
The fourth flood crest passed the city with a water level of
29.39 meters early in the morning of August 10. The water level
has been dropping slowly since then.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Brings Back Free Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Budapest, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will implement free
higher education once again for college students, a reversal of
the practice by the former government.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government decided to implement free education
for students enlisting in colleges after graduation from middle
schools, starting on September 1, the newspaper Nepszava reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that college students must pay their own tuition
if they wanted to pursue advanced studies or turn to other
specialities after graduation from colleges.
</P>
<P>
Hungary for long had free higher education in the past. But
the previous government, carrying economic tightening in 1995,
stipulated that college students must pay tuition.
</P>
<P>
The present government decided to resume free higher education,
which was promised to voters by the major ruling party, the
Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Party (Fidesz).
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to implement some free professional
training programs.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Prime Minister Sees Gains in Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile says the restructuring of the cabinet is aimed at
increasing Government efficiency, both in terms of the number of
ministers, and in coherence.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is preparing a government reshuffle which is
expected to take place in the second half of this month.
</P>
<P>
The ruling program of the Vasile cabinet provides for
government restructuring by cutting down on the number of
ministries and secretary of state positions.
</P>
<P>
Vasile told the daily newspaper Cronica Romana on Friday that
"The question of whether some activities and ministries will merge
is still debatable. Different versions are proposed so that an
acceptable pattern may be reached.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is how to merge some ministries in order to
increase their efficiency," the prime minister said, "The final
decision will be exclusively mine."
</P>
<P>
Vasile believed restructuring would begin with cuts in public
spending, and substantial lay-offs would start with the Government
itself.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all leaders of the coalition parties supported
him.
</P>
<P>
"It is undoubtedly the main achievement of the cabinet I'm
running, I mean not personally mine but the whole team's, the
coalition's finally," he said.

MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said
Friday he has chosen a spokesman to do the talking for him so that
he can concentrate on the more pressing tasks in his office.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to have my time taken up answering questions

</P>
<P>
Estrada said earlier that he will appoint Jerry Barican, a
veteran and respected journalist, to be his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that as spokesman, he will serve as the
president's "microphone" or "loudspeaker" who will amplify and
clarify issues, decisions and policies set by the president and
his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Barican, who will assume his post next week, said that his job
will complement and will never compete with the tasks of the
Office of the Press Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Barican said he will never allow a recurrence of the clash
between the spokesman and the press secretary, which happened
during the previous administration.

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Membership Should Come Before Taiwan's: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
said here Thursday that China should be allowed to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) before Taiwan gains membership.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li Zhaoxing told a gathering of the World Affairs
Council of Washington, DC, that in line with the regulations and
principles of the WTO, Taiwan, as part of China, should not be
given the access first.
</P>
<P>
"The regulation of the principle of the WTO is explicit itself,
that is, only when the sovereign state becomes a member of the WTO
could it become possible for part of that state to apply and
become a member of that distinguished World Trade Organization,"
he said in reply to a question on Taiwan's WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
The United States had been negotiating with both the mainland
of China and China's Taiwan Province on their admissions to the
WTO. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office announced last week
that it had concluded its bargaining with Taiwan, giving rise to
speculations that Taiwan might be allowed to join the organization
before the mainland is given the green light.
</P>
<P>
China has stated that it wants to become a WTO member as a
developing country, but the United States believes that China's
economy is too big to join on such a term.
</P>
<P>
Washington's announcement last week was seen as being designed
to put more pressure on China to make more concessions.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan issue is an issue concerning our national
sovereignty and territorial integrity. I believe the peaceful
reunification of the motherland is a common aspiration of the 1.2
billion Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan,"
Ambassador Li said in a live television questions and answers
session.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan became part of China at least 2000 years ago, and it is
still so. And under this principle, anything, including political
party matters, could be discussed between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
But the One-China principle is a must," added Li, who assumed
his post in March after serving for years as China's deputy
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He first made a 30 minute speech focusing on President Bill
Clinton's late June trip to China, where he announced the "Three
No's" on Taiwan: no support for two Chinas or One China One
Taiwan; no support for Taiwan's independence; and no support for
Taiwan's admission to any international organization which
consists of sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
Responding to criticism from conservative Congressmen, the
Clinton Administration said that such explicit expression was
designed to promote peaceful dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"After long separation of Taiwan from the Mainland, naturally
there is still a sort of lack of understanding. But I sincerely
believe, as millions and millions of people from Taiwan now are
visiting the mainland, year in and year out, (that) mutual
understanding too will be enhanced," Ambassador Li said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has proposed starting political negotiations with
Taiwan in order to terminate political confrontation. It is also
suggested that protocol issues be worked out to pave the way for
political talks.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said: "I believe if the Chinese people have the
opportunity to handle this issue themselves without being
interfered with by outside forces, we can get ahead and we can
move on with success."

PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A 78-year-old man killed two women

</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted police as saying that one of
the injured was an 84-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
Roger Belusca left his house at 9:30 in the morning and crossed

</P>
<P>
He shot the proprietress, Marie Josee Tessier, 65, in the chest
at point-blank range as she stood outside the shop.
</P>
<P>
He entered the shop, shot dead a 17-year-old employee, Sandrine
Stawoski, and injured the manager of the shop, Esther Dagouassat,
who is 32, and a client named Odette Martin, 84.
</P>
<P>
Belusca returned to his house and tried to commit suicide by
shooting himself in the face. But he survived and was not in
critical condition, said police.
</P>
<P>
Police did not rule out madness as the cause of Belusca's
action, because he had never had any dispute with the hair
dressing shop.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't's Non-intervention in Financial Markets Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), emphasized
here Friday that the government will, as before, adhere strictly
to its long-standing policy of non-intervention in the stock and
futures markets.
</P>
<P>
However, it will "take resolute action to reduce market
distortion, if we find that there is an abundantly clear linkage
between the speculative activities in the currency market, and
those in the stock and futures markets. We have the responsibility
to act swiftly to market play in order to provide a healthy
environment for our economy to adjust," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung made the statement at a press briefing here Friday
afternoon following Financial Secretary Donald Tsang exercised his
power under the Exchange Fund Ordinance and asked the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) to draw upon the resources of the
Exchange fund to mount appropriate counter activities in the stock
and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government has no intention to
artificially support the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"The measures we have taken today directed specifically against
the speculative activities under the present economic situation.
We are fully aware that we are undergoing a very long adjustment
period and adjustment will be painful but we are well prepared as
a community to take such pain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that before implementing these measures, "we have
given really very careful and detailed consideration to their
implications and their effects."
</P>
<P>
Noting massive speculative activities in the Hong Kong dollar
market and the stock and futures over the past week, Tung said:
"We have been keeping a watchful eye on these activities, and have
come to the firm conclusion that there has been an abundantly
clear linkage between the currency play and the play in the stock
and futures markets."
</P>
<P>
"They have brought along instability to the Hong Kong dollar
market and artificially forced up the interest rate. Such
destabilizing activities disrupt the course of our economic
adjustment", he said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue to keep a watchful eye on the markets and
take timely and resolute action as and when it is necessary," he
added.

for flights to the United States, Britain and parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Traffic rose 8.5 percent over the same month last year for
Canadian Airlines International Ltd., largely because of a jump in
demand for international and charter flights.
</P>
<P>
Traffic in these categories increased 12.5 percent, fueled by
flights to Britain, the United States, and especially to Hong Kong
and Taiwan where traffic rose 34 and 38 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the airline's domestic traffic rose only 2.1
percent from July last year, according to the Financial Post.
</P>
<P>
At Air Canada, traffic was up 6.4 percent. Business flights to
the U.S. formed the backbone of the increase, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was also popular for Air Canada, with a 30 percent
traffic hike.
</P>
<P>
Domestic traffic by Air Canada was up only 1.2 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Both airlines flew at almost the same capacity: 73.5 percent
for Canadian Airlines International and 73.4 percent for Air
Canada.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't, Congress Agree to Forge Budget Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reached
a consensus Friday night with Congress to map out a budget accord
that will spell out the government's plans and programs to be
implemented and funded for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
A news release from the Presidential Palace said the consensus
was reached after a budget accord meeting held between top
government officials and leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said the
executive branch will submit to the legislature a proposed joint
House and Senate resolution calling for the formulation of the
three-year budget accord.
</P>
<P>
He said the first-ever budget accord to be forged between the
government and Congress will set ceilings on government
expenditures to ensure fiscal discipline and realize the Estrada
administration's pro-poor programs.
</P>
<P>
The government proposed the accord, which forms part of
Estrada's 10-point action agenda for the first 100 days, to guide
the administration against wasteful spending and to ensure the
delivery of public services at the least possible cost.
</P>
<P>
The three-year budget program revolves on the administration's
priority agenda of modernizing the agriculture sector, ensuring
food security, installing safety nets for sectors vulnerable to
market liberalization, creating jobs and lowering commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan will have to be drawn up with limited resources
and correct priorities since the new administration is grappling
with a projected 70 billion peso (1.6 billion U.S. dollar) fiscal
deficit, a 700 million peso (16.3 million dollar) domestic debt
and a 45 billion dollar foreign debt.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks sharply
rebounded Friday to firm above the 7,000-point level as the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) drew on its hefty foreign
exchange reserves against speculators in the stock and futures
markets.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index soared 564.27 points, or 8.47
percent Friday to end the week at 7,224.69, after diving to a new
five-year low of 6660.42 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One hour after the stock market closed, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang confirmed that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA), Hong Kong's de facto central bank, drew upon the resources
of the Exchange Fund to mount appropriate counter activities in
the stock and futures markets Friday.
</P>
<P>
The intervention brought an all-round gain in the market, with
utility, property, commerce and industry shares shooting up by
around ten percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was active at 8.547 billion HK dollars (1.096 billion
U.S. dollars), the highest over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index advanced 2.9 percent during the week, which
saw the volatile market nose-dived to a five-year low amid fears
about the crippling Japanese yen, rumors on a possible yuan
devaluation and the break of the peg, and disappointment at poor
mid-year corporate earnings reports.

<HEADLINE> 11 Kidnappers Arrested in Northern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Eleven suspected kidnappers were
arrested and their victim rescued Friday in a lightning raid by
the Philippines' Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force in a
private resort in the central Philippine province of Laguna.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson, commander of the task
force, told reporters that the suspects were sleeping when eight
members of the elite police unit barged into the kidnappers'
hideout in Pansol town, Laguna.
</P>
<P>
During the successful raid, the police rescued the kidnap
victim, Lucia Lee Chan, a wealthy fish trader who was abducted in
front of her house in a Manila suburb Wednesday. The suspects
demanded a ransom of 5 million pesos (125,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chan was unhurt during the daring rescue operation which came
barely a week when the task force solved another kidnapping with
the arrest of two suspects.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who are all from Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, had no chance to escape when they were surprised by
the elite police force.
</P>
<P>
The task force was organized by President Joseph Estrada just
last month in a bid to fight criminal syndicates such as
kidnap-for-ransom, bank robbers and drug lords.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Moscow stock market was
buoyed up on Friday, boosted by a commitment earlier by President
Boris Yeltsin to defend the rouble.
</P>
<P>
The Russian liquidity shares grew eight to 15 percent by 1
p.m. Moscow time, while quotations grew about five basic points in
the GKO-Fbs government securities, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The quotations in currency instruments sector rose as well with
eurobonds and state debts gaining three to four points. The PRINS
prices, the benchmark of the market, reached 31-31.5 percent of
face value.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency also reported that Russian blue chips
jumped five to seven percent in the first two hours of heavier
trading Friday, with oil stocks leading the way with gains of
13-18 percent.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin vowed Friday not to devalue the rouble and
appealed to parliament to hold a special mid-recess crisis session
on government draft laws in face of a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But a senior trader at Trinfiko, Anatoly Polun, warned that the
upward trend in share trading may not last long, and any bad news
could push prices down again.
</P>
<P>
Russian traders hoped the president's statement would help
improve the situation on the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Though market situation is very uncertain. The market is
orientated upwards rather than downwards, Itar-Tass cited Russian
traders as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, on a tour in the
city of Kazan, east of Moscow, on Friday, has been urging the
Duma, lower house of parliament, to pass a package of a dozen tax
and other bills, a vital part of anti-crisis austerity measures
aimed at returning economic stability.
</P>
<P>
But the Duma is yet to decide whether to hold such a session.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada's largest stock exchange,
the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), has issued a set of proposed
guidelines for releasing stock-related information through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are primarily intended to provide standards for
information disseminated on the Internet and aimed at investors.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest ways for companies to respond to rumors in
chat groups or news groups.
</P>
<P>
The TSE "recommends against a company participating in a chat
or news group in order to dispel or clarify a rumor," the
guidelines say.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the company should tell the stock exchange's market
surveillance unit. If the data is false and influencing the share
price, it should consider issuing a news release.
</P>
<P>
The TSE also asks companies to "prohibit employees from
participating in Internet chat circles or news groups in talks
relating to the company or its securities."
</P>
<P>
It says all postings on company Web sites must conform to TSE
and securities regulators' disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange also recommends all information given to
analysts and institutional investors be made available to all
investors via the Web, but promotional material should be
excluded.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Talk with IMF for Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angola government is sending
a delegation to the United States to talk with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) over its economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Neto Costa, senior official of the Financial Ministry, who
released the news Friday, said that the delegation would talk
with IMF about a short-term loan which is due resently.
</P>
<P>
Costa did not specify the amount of the loan, but he said that
the talk may help alleviate the burden the country is
shouldering.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government, which is facing the problem of
paying back the loan, may be in a better position in talking with
the creditors if it could reach an agreement with IMF in
enhancing its economic structure reform.
</P>
<P>
The economic structure reform agreement is regarded as a
preferential policy to the low-income countries. All loans
obtained on the basis of the agreement are of low-interest (0.5%
interest rate) and long-term.
</P>
<P>
Costa said that the reform the government is to take will be
concentrated on re-structuring its expense structure and cutting
down the public expense.
</P>
<P>
It is said that about 30 percent of Angola's government budget
goes to the military, and the prolonged civil war has seriously
destroyed basic infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
IMF has been very unhappy with the financial structure in the
southern African country, so it got very little loan from IMF.

<HEADLINE> Video Addiction Brings Troubles for Young Canadians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- One in every four young Canadians
who play video games is addicted to them, and troubled by a
feeling of helplessness and lack of control in their lives, a
report by the Simon Fraser University (SFU) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study by SFU communication professor Stephen Kline surveyed
650 British Columbia youngsters and found that 25 percent reported
playing video games for seven to 30 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
The report was to be released later this month.
</P>
<P>
The rate of addiction was higher among males. Thirty percent
spent more than seven hours a week in battling figures flickering
on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
Among females, the addiction rate was 12 percent. They play
games such as Doom, Final Fantasy and Mortal Kombat.
</P>
<P>
"I'm struck by the feelings of isolation and helplessness
expressed by the heavy players, and their desire to establish a
more balanced lifestyle," said Mr. Kline, whose research involved
questionnaires and interviews.
</P>
<P>
The SFU report warns that the global video games industry,
which amounts to a 17 billion U.S. dollars business a year, larger
than the children's television and film industry, is controlling
and shaping the play worlds of children.
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, video games are even more violent, militaristic
and graphic than anything we see on screen," Mr. Kline said, "I
don't think people are fully aware of either the scope of the
industry or the impact video games are having on our kids."

NEW DELHI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Prevention was the only cure
to child prostitution in the country as it would be tough to
retrieve all victims trapped in the complex racket, Chairman of
the National Human Rights Commission Justice M. N. Venkatachaliah
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen here, he said that a campaign would be
launched by the commission on September 10 this year to combat
child prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The justice said that the complexity of the problem was such
that a more pro-active step was needed to prevent children from
falling into flesh trade.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the lack of response from the society
to sexual abuse of children, he said that a massive upsurge and
condemnation by the society would put considerable pressure on
those thriving on the racket of child prostitution.
</P>
<P>
The commission would launch the campaign to sensitize law
enforcement agencies and bureaucracy through a series of programs
in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Justice and
Employment, the Delhi government, non-governmental organizations,
and Delhi police so as to build public will to combat the evil,
Venkatachaliah said.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Liberation Tigers
of the Tamil Eelam (LTTE) hijacked a foreign merchant ship off the
northeastern coast of Sri Lanka Friday, according to informed
sources here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said gunmen from the LTTE seized a Dubai-owned
merchant vessel with 21 crew members on board, including 16 Indian
nationals.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000-ton ship was on its way to the northern peninsula of
Jaffna from Colombo. The ship was carrying cement and general
cargo for traders in Jaffna city.
</P>
<P>
According to Indian diplomats here, they were in contact with
the Sri Lankan military authorities and the International
Committee of the Red Cross on the fate of the crew members. But so
far there have been no details of the rebel attack.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the Sri Lankan
government since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the north and
east of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Liu Liqing, director of the
State Postal Service Bureau, today announced that his bureau plans
to issue a special stamp to solicit donations for flood disaster
relief this year.
</P>
<P>
This will be a single stamp scheduled to be issued on September

will cost 1 yuan (100 fen) and the entire cost will be turned over
to the concerned departments for the flood relief effort, Liu
said. The State Postal Service Bureau plans to circulate 30 million
of these special donation stamps.
</P>
<P>
Although the issuance of such a stamp usually takes 2 years,
this stamp will be treated as a special case, he said, adding that
the State Postal Service Bureau has made all the necessary
preparations, from the design and printing to transport and sales.
</P>
<P>
China has only issued three sets of stamps attached to
donations since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949. The others went to social welfare efforts for children and

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Announces Reform Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT), the
country's central bank, announced Friday a bank reform package,
under which the BOT orders seven financial institutions to write
down their registered and paid-up capital.
</P>
<P>
The BOT said in a press release said the seven institutions,
including two banks and five financial companies, are unable to
have sufficient recapitalization nor can they find new potential
investors within the time frame, which ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seven institutions, which also have high non-performing
loans, become insolvent and cannot carry on their normal
operation.
</P>
<P>
"If they are allowed to continue their operation without
rectifying the problems, losses to the public will incur," the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The BOT thus ordered the seven institutions, namely Laem Thong
Bank, Union Bank of Bangkok, Dhana Siam Finance and Securities
Plc., First City Investment Plc., IFCT Finance and Securities
Plc., Vajiradhanathun Finance Co. Ltd., and Thai Summit Finance
and Securities Limited, to write down their registered and paid-up
capital to one satang (0.00025 U.S. dollars) per share to wipe out
losses.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, these institutions must recapitalize to meet legal
capital adequacy ratio of 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, with the consent of the Finance Ministry, the BOT
removed the current Boards of Directors of these institutions and
appointed new Board of Directors, which have started working from
Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the BOT's intervention and appointment of the new
management, these two banks and 12 finance companies, including
the seven companies taken over by the BOT earlier in May, shall be
restructured.
</P>
<P>
Laem Thong Bank will be merged with Radhanasin Bank, a bank the
government set up in March this year to take care of the assets of
the ill financial companies, and find foreign strategic partners
later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Union Bank of Bangkok will be merged with
Krungthai Thanakit, a financial company under the state-owned
commercial Krungthai Bank, and the 12 finance companies after
which foreign investors or strategic partners will be arranged
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The package has gained the approval of a special Cabinet
meeting later Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the Thai government and the
International Monetary Fund, commercial banks in Thailand must
recapitalize before the deadline of August 14.
</P>
<P>
But only four of the 15 banks have been able to raise capital
or find new foreign strategic partners. The banks have either
suspended new loans or cut credit lines as they have been unable
to raise capital.

<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the Philippines'
Armed Forces Geographical Unit were killed and three others were
wounded in an ambush Friday morning in the southern province of
Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Initial police reports indicated that the ambush took place
while the victims were on their way to the town of Lamitan for an
important meeting, according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The unit commander and two unit members died on the spot from
multiple gunshot wounds when an undetermined number of
heavily-armed men attacked them.
</P>
<P>
The unit was not able to fight back as the ambushers caught
them by surprise while they were on board a jeep.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities who rushed to the crime scene were not able
to catch up with the perpetrators who immediately fled after the
ambush.
</P>
<P>
Police said the motive could be about a dispute on the land
that the unit was tasked to supervise by a businessman. But they
have yet to establish the real motive behind the broad daylight
killing.
</P>
<P>
The local police are still pursuing the unidentified suspects.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 China International Tea
Cultural Fair will be held September 15-20 at the National
Agricultural Exhibition Center in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An official from the event's sponsor, the Society for the
Promotion of Traditional Chinese Culture, said at a press
conference here today that the fair will be the largest of its
kind ever held in China, where the tradition of tea dates back to
the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The fair will provide a chance for Chinese and foreign
specialists and businessmen to conduct cultural exchanges as well
as industrial and trade cooperation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During the six-day fair, about 300 enterprises from 14
countries and regions worldwide will exhibit more than 1,000
varieties of tea-leaves, tea-sets, pottery tea accessories, and
tea manufacturing and packaging equipment, according to the
official.

<HEADLINE> Super Hybrid Rice to Be Born in China By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A super high-yielding hybrid
rice whose per-hectare output may be 20 percent higher than the
present hybrids will be born in China by 2000, a reknowned hybrid
rice expert announced here today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of breakthroughs in breeding technology, the super
rice can produce 12,000 kilograms per hectare after a growth
period of 120 days, said Yuan Longping, director of the China
National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center.
</P>
<P>
The daily yield per unit area is designed to be 100 kilos per
hectare, so even higher outputs can be achieved after a longer
growth period, Yuan told the ongoing 18th International Congress
of Genetics.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural scientist believes that the new hybrid will be
of great significance to China's grain supply in the coming
decades as the country's population continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
Seeding the rice on 6.6 million hectares of paddy fields in
2003 is expected to add 15 million tons of rice to the nation's
store, or eight percent of the annual grain yield, according to
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
His center launched the super rice program initiated by the
Ministry of Agriculture in 1996, aimed at achieving a yield of
9,750 kilos per hectare in the succeeding two years.
</P>
<P>
However, trial planting in small plots of land has yielded more
than 13,000 kilos per hectare, and large-scale experiments will be
started in Hunan and Sichuan provinces next year, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that we can fulfill the goal or even be
more successful by 2000," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China is not the only country to implement the super rice
program, but may be the first one to complete the effort.
</P>
<P>
The first breeding program for super high-yielding rice was
initiated in Japan in 1980 with the aim of developing new
varieties capable of outyielding the old ones by 50 percent within
15 years.
</P>
<P>
"But it hasn't been reported successful so far," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
The International Rice Research Institute also started the
super rice program to develop 12,000 kilos of rice per hectare
within 120 days, the same as Yuan's. But the goal will not be
fulfilled until 2005, said Yuan, who is the chief consultant of
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old academician with the Chinese Academy of
Engineering has helped China increase its grain output by over 300
million tons since he bred the world's first hybrid rice in 1973.
</P>
<P>
These hybrids now have been introduced into some 20 countries
and regions around the world

LANZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has pledged to intensify the fight against smuggling activities as
part of an effort to stabilize the province's economic order.
</P>
<P>
"The large amounts of oil products smuggled into the country
have brought about a considerable drop in the price of domestic
oil products, and caused many domestic oil plants to operate at a
loss," said a senior official.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and the first half of this year, Lanzhou Customs
prevented 28 cases of smuggling involving some 340 million yuan in
goods.
</P>
<P>
In order to strike hard at the smugglers, the province has
recently set up a comprehensive anti-smuggling office comprised
of personnel from 21 related government departments.
</P>
<P>
"Priority will be given to a crackdown on the smuggling of
automobiles, sheep's wool and narcotics," the official said.

trading volume and value for the second week in a row, the Arabic

<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's trade deficit with Asia, including
central Asia and the Far East, has grown to 21 million dollars
this year, compared with a trade surplus of 800 million dollars in
the first seven months of 1997, the English daily The Jerusalem
Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's trade surplus with the U.S. nearly doubled
to 1.6 billion dollars in the period, while the huge deficit with
the European Union shrank by 23 percent to 3.6 billion dollars
from 4.7 billion dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Publicity Blitz Launched in Australia to Sell Tax Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has
begun its pre-election publicity blitz to sell its newly-released
tax reform plans.
</P>
<P>
The publicity blitz began Friday as Australian Prime Minister
John Howard appeared in at least seven domestic radio or
television programs Friday advocating the tax reform package
unveiled Thursday, and will be followed by a series of national
print and television advertisements beginning this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tax reform package coverage dominated Friday's edition of
Australia's national newspapers, and radio and television news
programs.
</P>
<P>
The package, which was designed to reform the nation's 70
year-old tax system, appeared acceptable to the majority of the
Australians as they are set to benefit from the government's
proposed tax cuts and compensation packages, including income tax
cuts for middle- and low-income earners.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Friday afternoon in Adelaide, capital city of South
Australian state, Howard said under his plan, up to 80 percent of
the workforce would pay a maximum 30 cents in the dollar tax, with
most unlikely to ever move up into a higher tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
That means middle- and low- income earners would pay less
income tax for the same amount of income after the introduction of
the proposed income tax.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the reform package would provide an incentive for
workers to take on a second job or work overtime.
</P>
<P>
"This is very much a taxation reform for middle Australia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We've devised tax scales for families, for middle
Australia..." he added.
</P>
<P>
Organizations representing the nation's farmers, small
business, and some leading banks have already announced their
support for the reform plans, which would bring cost reduction to
them through tax cuts or scrapping of some existing taxes.
</P>
<P>
The national print and television advertisement campaign, which
will begin this weekend, would cost 6 million U.S. dollars,
Special Minister of State Nick Minchin said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tax reform information hotlines have already been set up by the
government to help the public understand the reform plans.
</P>
<P>
Detailed information about the reform plans is also available
on a government's website on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the prime minister would call a federal
election in October, leaving about one month for the government,
whose first term expires in March, 1999, to persuade the voters to
accept its tax reform plans.

<HEADLINE> France Sends Envoy to Countries Close to Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- France has sent a special envoy to
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan to seek
insight information on the political and military situation in
Afghanistan, said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Former French ambassador to Islamabad, Pierre Lafrance, was due
to ask these countries with privileged relations with the
triumphant Afghan Taliban guerrillas to pressure the latter to
allow humanitarian groups to return to Afghanistan, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Lafrance has already met with the Saudi foreign
minister, Prince Saud al Faysal. He should see Saturday the
foreign minister of Pakistan and should meet the leaders of the
United Arab Emirates on August 16," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
France and other European Union countries have blamed Taliban
for violating human rights, especially the rights of women, and
for expelling international humanitarian groups from the country.
</P>
<P>
But French media have warned against the strengthening of U.S.
stand in the oil-rich Central Asian region, if Washington reaches
a deal with the Taliban, which wishes to be recognized by the
United Nations as the legitimate government of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Talibans are now controlling more than three-fourths of the
territory of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Rejects U.S. Demand for Auto Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has rejected a demand
by the United States to lower its tariff of eight percent on
imported cars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will not negotiate the tariff rate on auto imports,
said Chung Eui-yong, deputy minister of state for trade on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to persuade the Americans to drop their
demands for a change in our tax systems for automobiles," he said
in response to questions on the Seoul-Washington talks about
greater liberalization for South Korea's automobile market.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach an agreement on auto trade
disputes during their three-day Washington talks which closed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Washington demanded a cut in the eight percent duty system of
South Korea on imported cars, and the demand was rejected by Seoul
with an argument that its rate is lower than the European Union's
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which earlier asked Seoul to cut its duty rate to
2.5 percent, required a cut to four percent.
</P>
<P>
The two sides differed on the automobile tax system.
Washington insisted on reducing the taxes imposed on cars while
Seoul said it would take time to streamline the system.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot streamline the tax system immediately
because it cannot afford to reduce its revenue, especially at a
time when the economy is ailing," Chung said.
</P>
<P>
However, the two nations came close to an agreement that South
Korea will allow automakers to inspect automobiles and recall them
voluntarily in cases where defects are found.
</P>
<P>
At present, Seoul rules that all automakers obtain type
approval from the government and have their vehicles inspected by
a government agency before being allowed to sell them.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also agreed to allow financing companies to take
autos purchase on installment as security.
</P>
<P>
Because of the disputes over the trade, the U.S. designated
South Korea's auto market last year as Priority Foreign Country
Practice (PFCP), under the Super 301 provision of U.S. trade law.
</P>
<P>
With the South Korean market designated PFCP, Washington is
allowed under Super 301 to impose retaliatory import duties on
South Korean products unless Seoul and Washington settle the
disputes by October 19.
</P>
<P>
Seoul said it will take the case to the World Trade
Organization's (WTO) dispute panel if Washington takes retaliatory
measures against South Korean goods.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul hopes that before the deadline, South Korean and
the U.S. auto trade negotiators will be able to resolve the trade
disputes through their talks next month.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Inch Up on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices closed higher on
the Singapore Stock Market Friday on a technical rebound after
massive selling over the week as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrial Index inched up 8.37 points to end at 974.11 points.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the upside for the market remained limited due to
weak sentiment. They said program selling from hedge funds which
started earlier this week appeared to have tailed off, leading to
shortcovering by some speculators ahead of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The market was somewhat encouraged by the rally in Hong Kong,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover declined to 124.03 million shares worth
267.42 million Singapore dollars (about 153.69 million U.S.
dollars). Advances led declines by 150 to 119 while 323 counters
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
DBS F was the most active stock of the day as it registered a
turnover of 8.85 million units. It was followed by SingTel that
had 8.36 million stocks traded. KepLand was next with 5.85 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH topped the gainers of the day as it rose by 30 cents to
close at 12.70 Singapore dollars. CityDev edged up 14 cents to
finish at 4.00 Singapore dollars. OUB F was up 14 cents to end at
3.10 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, CMSport was the biggest loser of the day as it
shed 71 cents to close at 1.20 Hong Kong dollars. Creative 50 slid
by 60 cents to finish at 16.70 Singapore dollars. DBS F slipped by
55 cents to end at 7.75 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Former Chinese Navy Commander's Final Resting Place Is The Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Deng Zhaoxiang, a former deputy
commander of the Chinese Navy who died on August 6 at the age of
95, was cremated in Beijing today and will return to the place he
loved and belonged to when his ashes are released into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Deng spent much of his life in the navy, and for 72 years
watched it grow in strength and participated in some colorful
events, one of which made him famous across China, when he led the
officers and enlisted men of the Kuomintang warship "Chongqing" in
revolt and went over to the People's Liberation Army in early 1949.
</P>
<P>
Deng was born in 1903 in Gaoyao, Guangdong Province, and
entered Whampoa Navy Academy in 1914 at the age of 11. After
graduation, he attended the Yantai Naval Academy, and Nanjing
Torpedo and Gun Academy. In 1928, he was sent to Britain by the
KMT Government to study at the Greenwich Royal Navy Academy and
Navy Torpedo School.
</P>
<P>
He returned to China on the eve of the War of Resistance to
Japan (1937-1945) and served as head of training and education at
the Tongzi Naval Academy in 1942. After World War II, he served as
captain of the cruiser "Chongqing" and later organized the revolt.
</P>
<P>
After 1949, Deng was appointed successively president of the
Andong Naval Academy and the Naval Mosquito Boat Academy,
vice-president of the First Naval Academy, and a naval base deputy
chief of staff and deputy commander. Moreover, he served as deputy
fleet commander of the PLA naval forces and deputy commander of
the Chinese navy from 1960 to 1981 and contributed tremendously to
improving PLA naval forces.
</P>
<P>
After 1983, he became vice-chairman of the national committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
until 1998 and took an active part in social and political
activities, committing himself to fact-finding tours to factories,
rural areas, army units, schools, and construction sites.
</P>
<P>
He concerned himself very much with the reunification of the
motherland and worked towards that goal in his later years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People Make Donations To Help Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Helpful Hong Kong residents
from all walks of life have been making donations through
different channels in the past several weeks to help their
flood-stricken compatriots on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Special Administrative Region (SAR) government has
contributed 9 million HK dollars (1.2 million U.S. dollars)
through three local relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
On top of government aid, local dignitaries and ordinary people
have demonstrated their generosity at times of economic adversity.
 They are actively making donations either in cash or in relief
materials to ease the pains suffered by the flood victims along a
swollen Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The major charity organization Hong Kong Red Cross said Monday
it was approaching its target of 10 million HK dollars (1.3
million U.S. dollars) after about a week's fund-raising
activities. Of that, 3 million HK dollars (385,000 U.S. dollars)
was a grant from the SAR government's disaster relief fund.
</P>
<P>
The local Red Cross will be sending delegates to the flooded
provinces to monitor and help with the relief program.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Red Cross, World Vision Hong Kong, Oxfam Hong
Kong and Medecins Sans Frontieres have in the past days published
their accounts on major newspapers into which people can directly
transfer donations.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong raised
more than one million HK dollars for the victims through various
fund-raising activities and handed the sum to the local Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the party Tsang Yok-sing praised the people of Hong
Kong for their generosity in the midst of the economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch said that up to Wednesday,
Hong Kong people had donated around 66 million HK dollars (8.5
million U.S. dollars), of which businessman Li Ka-shing
contributed 50 million HK dollars (6.4 million U.S. dollars), to
the flood victims through the agency.
</P>
<P>
Around one hundred vendors in Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon, held a
one-day charity sale on Thursday to raise funds for the victims,
which drew warm responses from neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
A fruit vendor told reporters that, being Chinese, Hong Kong
people can not stand on the sidelines while their compatriots were
suffering from the severe flooding. He said wholesalers had
distributed fruits to them at lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the mainland floods, the Hong Kong garrison of
the People's Liberation Army have raised more than one million HK
dollars (128,000 U.S. dollars) to help the victims.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 soldiers participated in fund-raising activities
Wednesday at military barracks across Hong Kong and at their
Shenzhen base, according to a spokesman for the garrison.
</P>
<P>
Since July, local media have been giving wide coverage of the
worst flooding in nearly half a century in China.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa last week appealed for Hong Kong
people to help the victims. "I understand very well that Hong Kong
is experiencing an economic downturn and many citizens feel very
frustrated in the face of economic or unemployment problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But I would like to point out that the victims on the mainland
are now facing a very serious disaster," Tung told his fellow
people, asking everyone to lend a hand "to help our compatriots
out."
</P>
<P>
The latest of the fund-raising events will be two gala shows
this weekend which will be broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
Asia Television Ltd. (ATV) and Wharf Cable Television Ltd. will
jointly produce a show Friday night while Television Broadcasts
Ltd. (TVB) will organize a seven-hour event together with major
charities on Saturday night. Hotlines are to be set up during the
two shows for donations.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the SAR government, six major charity
organizations in Hong Kong -- the Yan Chai Hospital, the Pok Oi
Hospital, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, the Po Leung Kuk, the
Yan Oi Tong and the Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society -- announced
Thursday they will get together to raise funds for the victims in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It is, as I can recall, the first time for such large-scale
collaboration," said Director of Home Affairs Shelley Lau.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of their joint efforts will be a flag day,
planned for late next month.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Paradise for White Stork </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 14 (Xinhua)-- The Honghe Marshland Nature
Reserve, located some 300 km from Jiamusi City in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, is one of China's largest natural
habitats for stork.
</P>
<P>
China is home to some 1,000 white stork, a rare water bird
species on the brink of extinction, with approximately one-fifth
the species living in the Honghe Reserve. Now white storks thrive
on small fish and shrimp in the reserve.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is also home to over 160 species of birds, 25
animals and 1,000 plant species. Twenty-odd rare species in the
reserve are under state protection, including the white storks,
red-crested crane, lynx, leopards and swans.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, established in 1984, covers 20,000
hectares. Ecologists agree that the reserve is the sole surviving
primitive marsh ecosystem in China.
</P>
<P>
Swamps cover over half of the reserve, with grassy marshlands
account for 40 percent and forests 10 percent of the total land
area.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the reserve can catch a glimpse of three species of
rabbit and watch red deer feeding on the abundant grass. The
thickly wild flora and flowers in the reserve are frequented by
flocks of birds and forest frogs.
</P>
<P>
The skies above the forest most often features flocks of white
storks and Mandarin can be seen swimming in weeds characteristic
of the marshes.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Manager Zhu Baoguang points out that local government
efforts have protected the primitive ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
"Abandoned telephone poles and wires represent the only
evidence of human activity in the grassy marshland," according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested millions of yuan to protect
the reserve, said Zhu, adding that 10 workers currently maintain
the area.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the employees of three neighboring farms
are prohibited from encroaching on the resevere, and all
individuals causing damage are subject to severe punishment.

PARIS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- France Friday sent an Airbus
passenger plane to the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo)
to evacuate the French expatriates who wish to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"A civilian Airbus was sent this morning to the Democratic
Republic of Congo for facilitate the departure of the people who
wish to," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
About 100 out of the 500 French nationals remaining in the D.R.
Congo have expressed wish to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the international commercial flights to Kinshasa have
been suspended because of the risky situation in the D.R. Congo.
</P>
<P>
If the Airbus cannot land in Kinshasa, it will land in another
nearby city such as Libreville of Gabon, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is changing very quickly and we are following
its evolution with much vigilance," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was reported around the Inga hydro-electricity dam
near Boma, 400 kilometers southwest of Kinshasa, between the
rebellious Banyamulenge forces and government forces loyal to
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa has been deprived of both water and electricity since
Thursday, because of the fighting around Inga power station.
</P>
<P>
The Inga power center was the supplier of electricity for
Kinshasa, the province of Bas-Congo in the southwest, Katanga in
the southeast, and the capital of the Congo Republic Brazzaville
on the other side of the Congo River.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tracked
the Japanese yen higher Friday in Sydney, but still lost almost
half a U.S. cent this week.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia Treasury Manager Paul Macarounas said
trade was "erratic" during the local session with both the yen and
the Australian dollar swinging in a reasonably tight range.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the local unit was changing hands at 59.60 U.S.
cents, up from 59.14 U.S. cents late Thursday. It closed last
Friday at 60.18 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The yen was underpinned Friday by lingering fears that the
Japanese central bank would intervene to support the Asian
currency at the expense of the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Craig James, chief economist of Colonial State Bank, said
upside for the Australian dollar remained capped by weakness in
the Japanese yen as well as commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 86.53 Japanese yen from 86.91
yen at the close, 1.0643 German marks from 1.0600 marks.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Deplores Recruitment of Child Soldiers in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has deplored the latest recruitment into armed
service of hundreds of children, some as young as 12, in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"We are particularly concerned about the re-enlistment of
400-500 former child soldiers from a transit center near Kisangani
and more than 100 children in Bukavu who had been demobilized and
prepared for reintegration into families," the UNICEF said in a
statement issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF also said that the present hostilities in the DRC
have put on hold vital UNICEF programs including a scheduled
nationwide polio vaccination campaign and work to help the
children rejoin their families.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency called for an immediate ceasefire to make it
possible for the polio vaccination campaign to proceed as planned
and for children to return to school. The DRC has the highest
incidence of polio in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the same statement, the UNICEF said it is also gravely
concerned about the fate of children and women who have reportedly
been abducted during the current conflict in the African country.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to both sides of the conflict to renounce detention
of ethnic adversaries and to release all those who have been
detained to date.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Friday drew on its hefty foreign
exchange reserves to counterattack speculators in the stock and
futures markets, a top financial official confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index sharply rebounded 564.27 points,
or 8.47 percent to close at 7,224.69 Friday, after diving to a new
five-year low of 6660.42 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SAR Financial Secretary Donald Tsang told a promptly-called
press conference Friday: "I have exercised my power under the
Exchange Fund Ordinance and asked the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) to draw upon the resources of the Exchange Fund to mount
appropriate counter activities in the stock and futures markets."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the HKMA, Hong Kong's de facto central bank,
mounted counter activities earlier Friday.

the world after Japan and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
"I must make clear that we are not against the shorting of Hang
Seng Index futures by hedge funds, or indeed by anybody," said

manipulate our interest rates by engineering extreme conditions in
the money market so that they can benefit from the short positions
they have built up in Hang Seng Index futures."
</P>
<P>
The Financial Secretary reiterated that Kong Kong's

<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A breach in a 500-m. dike of the
Nenjiang River in the city of Daqing in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province at 6 a.m. today is threatening the Daqing
Oilfield, China's largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports show that the attempt to shore up the collapsed
embankment 100 km from downtown Daqing has been given up owing to
a lack of laborers.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 residents have been evacuated but life is normal
and there is no price-hikes in the city.
</P>
<P>
The floods have forced the oilfield to close down 155 wells,
but most of its nearly 20,000 wells are still operating
normally. In 1997, Daqing's oil output was 60.9 million tons, half
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Some 170,000 local people, soldiers, and police are busy
reinforcing two secondary dikes and the Heiyupao Reservoir to
protect the wells, power plants, water plants, and urban area.
</P>
<P>
The dikes have been reinforced with 11,38 million sandbags and
282.3 km of secondary dikes have also been reinforced.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the
provincial government are allocating 2 million sandbags and other
materials and large quantities of relief goods for Daqing.
</P>
<P>
Daqing Oilfield began operation in the early 1960s. The city
itself was established on December 4, 1979 on 21,000 sq.km. of
land. It has a population of 2.34 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1969, a flood that hit the oilfield caused a number of
deaths, but oil production did not stop because of strenuous
efforts by local people.

ridiculous, measures.

-- The Swiss banks finally yielded to put an end to a series of
action taken against them by the survivors of the Holocaust and
several Jewish organizations in the United States. The Swiss Union
of Banks and the Swiss Credit agreed on Wednesday to pay 1.25
billion U.S. dollars to the victims of Holocausts who had deposited
money in Swiss banks before World War II.

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- An agreement was struck on Wednesday in New York by the
defenders of the Jews who escaped Holocaust and the World Jewish
Congress on the one side and the Swiss Banks accused of robbing
Jewish properties during World War II. Several French banks
represented in New York have already been subpoenaed by Jewish
organizations.
</P>
<P>
-- The famous French singer Nino Ferrer, who wrote unforgettable
songs which became fantasy rather than orthodoxy, committed suicide
in his home in southern France with a hunting rifle on Thursday, on
the eve of his 64th birthday. His last album, ``Disillusion,'' was a
sign of his pessimism.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Price hikes are under control
and vegetable supplies have returned to normal in most
flood-stricken areas in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Heavy flooding since June have affected over 108 Hunan cities
and counties, and by the end of July had inundated over 54,666
hectares of vegetable production bases, sparking price hikes of
between 50-100 percent in some cities.
</P>
<P>
Local governments addressed the problem by allocating special
funds and establishing preferential prices for seeds, fertilizer,
and pesticide, as well as recommending new varieties with short
maturation periods.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable traders from neighboring provinces have also been
encouraged to offer products in Hunan.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in S. Africa Rising: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in South
Africa has been on the rise, increasing from 21 percent in 1996
to 22.9 percent in 1997, according to a survey released by the
Central Statistical Service (CSS).
</P>
<P>
For 1995 and 1994 the figure were 16.9 percent and 20 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is according to a new definition of unemployment adopted
by the CSS. Based on the previous definition, now called the
expanded unemployment rate, unemployment rose from 29.2 percent
through 35.6 percent to 37.6 percent between 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CSS's new definition of unemployment was in line with the
International Labor Organization definition, CSS chief Mark Orkin
said.
</P>
<P>
The definition was preferred by more than 80 percent of both
developed and less developed countries, and by South Africa's
major trading partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CSS's previous definition provided for two criteria for
respondents to the surveys to be classified as unemployed.
Firstly, they had not worked during the last seven days before
being questioned. Secondly, they want to work and are available
to start working within a week.
</P>
<P>
The new definition adds a third requirement, that they had
taken active steps to look for work or to start some form of
self-employment in the four weeks prior to the interview.
</P>
<P>
Based on the preliminary census results, there were an
estimated 22.3 million people in South Africa in 1997 aged
between 15 and 65 years, considered to be the working population.
</P>
<P>
About 7.5 million (32.6 percent) of them were gainfully
employed. The highest unemployment rate, 29.3 percent was among
blacks, while 16 percent of coloreds, 10.2 percent of Indians and
4.6 of whites were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The largest share of the employed (36.1 percent) fell into the
community, social and personal services sector, followed by
manufacturing (17.7 percent) and the wholesale, retail and
accommodation sector (16.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
"The impact of unemployment is being increasingly experienced
by women, Orkin said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the CSS's new definition of employment, 34.6 percent
of black women were unemployed in 1997 compared to 24.6 percent
of men.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Lunjie, who joined the
Internet just six month ago, today enjoys a flood of business
inquiries and orders from scores of foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
"A short six months ago we were an unknown entity and seldom
received orders," according to Zhao, general manager of the
Shanghai Lansheng Golf Equipment Co. Ltd. "The Internet has
enabled us to access the international market."
</P>
<P>
Over half of China's 15,000 medium- to large-sized state-owned
enterprises are conducting business via the Internet and a growing
number of small firms are following suit, according to the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that Internest use by enterprises represents the
third trend in the arrival of the Information Age in China,
followed by the popularization of personal computers and
establishment of information industry programs funded by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade firms, the most enthusiastic users of the
Internet during the first six months of this year established
numerous websites, more than 1,000 export firms attempted to
promote sales using the website offered by the Asian Resources, a
Philippine-based trade intermediary.

competitiveness of Chinese firms," according to Sarah Benecke,
president of Asian Resources.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have pointed out that China's fledgling
electronic information industry offers vast potential for
development. Moreover, they suggest the adoption of relevant laws

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Boost Electronics Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia aims to earn 4 billion
U.S. dollars from exporting electronic products this year, Antara
News Agency Friday quoted a Trade and Industry Ministry official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is not too high considering the sluggish situation
in the domestic market. However, we have the opportunity to
increase our electronics exports to Europe and the United States,
both of which have not been affected by the economic crisis (in
Asia)," director of the ministry's electronic goods division
Ardiansyah Parman said.
</P>
<P>
From January to April, Indonesia already earned 1 billion U.S.
dollars from the export of electronic products. The country earned
3.89 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and 3.9 billion U.S. dollars in
1996 from electronics exports.
</P>
<P>
To boost exports of this commodity, Parman said, the country's
electronics industry should form corporations or partnerships with
multinational companies.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Opposition Denies Forming Election Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's leading opposition
Virtue Party (FP) has denied the accusation that the opposition
parties attempted to form an alliance for the early elections next
year, the Daily News newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
FP's Deputy Chairman Ismail Alptekin at a press conference here
Thursday brushed aside claims by the ruling coalition that the
opposition was trying to form such an alliance. He clarified that
the recent talks among the five opposition parties were only aimed
at seeking a dialog instead of an election alliance.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of five opposition parties, including the FP, True Path
Party (DYP), Democratic Party, Liberal Democratic Party and
Rebirth Party, held a meeting in Istanbul late Tuesday, which drew
severe criticism from the ruling coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was held because "there must be a sound
dialog established in order to solve the country's problems,"
said Alptekin.
</P>
<P>
He accused the coalition parties, namely Motherland Party,
Democratic Left Party and Democratic Turkey Party, of trying to
find ways to evade the early elections.
</P>
<P>
"No one can escape from the elections. It must be held at the
time agreed by the parliament," Alptekin said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Parliament has decided that the early elections
will be held in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The closer cooperation between the pro-Islamic FP, a successor
of the former Welfare Party closed by the court, and the DYP has
triggered harsh reaction from the ruling coalition which reminded
the people not to forget the past of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The former FP-DYP coalition government led by Necmettin
Erbakan was forced to step down in June 1997 by the powerful
military for its alleged attempt to undermine the country's
secular systems.

<HEADLINE> China Investing Heavily on Rural Power Grids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to spend 100 billion
yuan on the upgrading of its rural power grids in some 2,000
counties from now to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Economists say the move would enable more rural households to
use electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The project will start on a trial basis in 500 better off
counties this year.
</P>
<P>
Electricity is still limited in many rural parts of China and
washing machines and refrigerators often sit unused at home for
much of the year.
</P>
<P>
Studies found that there were only 8 refrigerators, 27 color
TV sets and 22 washing machines for every 100 rural households in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Take Shanxi Province in north China for instance. The power
supply in its rural areas is far from meeting the growing
demand. Rural households consume only a dozen kwh of electricity
on average per month.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi will raise 10 billion yuan over the next three years to
improve its power grids in rural areas.

BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce announced here today
that it will provide 2 grain loaders for Beiliang Dock in the city

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand saw fewer births
and deaths in the year ending in June than the previous
corresponding period, a government release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Births registered in the year to June totalled 56,559, a drop
of 751 or 1.3 per cent from the previous period. Meanwhile, the
fertility rate fell fractionally from 1.96 to 1.94 births per
woman.
</P>
<P>
The fertility rate per woman "is now 8 percent below the level
required by the population to replace itself without migration,"
the release said.
</P>
<P>
The trend away from early childbearing is continuing, it said,
adding that the average age of women having children in the year
was 28.9 years, compared with 28.7 years in the previous year and
27.8 years in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Deaths registered in the year ending in June totalled 27,132,
down 673 or 2.4 per cent from a year earlier. As births fell by a
greater margin than deaths, the gap between births and deaths, or
the natural increase of the population, narrowed slightly from
29,505 in the year ending in June 1997 to 29,427 in the following
year.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Initiates Programs to Help Retirees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The vice-governor of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, Chen Zhenggao, pledged recently that
the province's retirees will be provided with a happy life.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's oldest industrial bases, Liaoning has 2.4
million retirees who have contributed to the founding and
development of new China, he said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a stable and happy life for the country's former
builders, Chen said, Liaoning has organized more than 10,000
working groups to help them solve various kinds of problems.
</P>
<P>
Those working groups send relief funds or gifts to the retirees
on festivals or birthdays, help them repair their houses or
electrical appliances, and assist poor retirees out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) of
relief funds was distributed among retirees, benefiting more than
80,000 families, the vice-governor said.
</P>
<P>
The province also periodically organizes recreational and
sports activities for the retirees so that they can have physical
exercises.
</P>
<P>
Some one million retirees voluntarily take part in such social
activities as helping maintain traffic order and mediating civil
disputes.

The cases have been reduced as against 894 cases in 1997 and
5291 cases in 1996, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Manufacturers Handle Exports Internally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Chinese
manufacturers which previously relied on export services provided
by state foreign trade companies are responding to government
encouragement and handling exports themselves.
</P>
<P>
State-owned and collective manufacturing enterprises in east
China's Jiangsu Province, the nation's second largest exporter,
currently handle close to 10 percent of local exports.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
had granted approval for 1,265 state-owned and collective
manufacturers in Jiangsu to undertake foreign trade activities by
the end of June this year. Related enterprises account for close
to 14 percent of the total number of firms in the province.
</P>
<P>
The companies have increased their contribution to the
province's exports from 3.1 percent to 10.5 percent over the past
five years alone, with direct exports for the first half of this
year growing by 11.5 percent on the 1997 period to 775 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the increase to efforts local
enterprises have made to explore both domestic and international
markets.
</P>
<P>
The change has also helped manufacturers improve internal
management and adopt advanced international product
standards. Many of the manufacturers have also established foreign
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Nanjing Jincheng Group Co. Ltd., a major
motorcycle producer with dozens of proprietary stores in a number
of foreign countries, including Colombia, Cambodia, Bangladesh and
Poland, arranges production schedules according to demand. The
company has in turn doubled annual exports for two successive
years.

<HEADLINE> China Putting An End To Supply Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of 601 major
commodities on the Chinese market showed a balance of supply and
demand and even an oversupply in some cases for the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The long periods of shortages that hampered China's economic
growth have come to an end, according to Chen Huai, a research
fellow at the State Council Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
A study by the China Internal Trade Bureau's Information Center
of the 1985-89 period showed supply far short of demand. Supply
and demand were balanced from the latter half of 1996 to the first
half of 1997, and since then it has been a buyer's market, one of
the welcome results of the change from a planned economy to a
market-driven one.
</P>
<P>
The change has also resulted in greater competition in product
quality and after-sales service, with ordinary consumers
benefitting from the wider range of choice. In fact, many young
Chinese nowadays hardly know what long queues or rationed
commodities are.
</P>
<P>
China has greater demand for large-scale investment in various
sectors and has used imported technology and managerial techniques
to improve quality.
</P>
<P>
Economists agree that there is still weak demand in China at
present, but consumer demand is growing.
</P>
<P>
The Research Center's Chen said that, although an oversupply
could lead to a reduction of industrial profits and a slack
market, it cannot be regarded as a step backward, but suggests
rather that China has reached the primary stage of industrial
development and that obstacles in the sphere of production have
been removed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese government has taken a series of measures
to help stop oversupplies with interest cuts, providing mortgages,
and infrastructure investment.

<HEADLINE> South China Beach Resort Promotes Environmental 'Green Card' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, August 14 (Xinhua)-- Tourists to the beach-side resort
of Sanya on the island province of Hainan will receive a "green
card" from their hotel.
</P>
<P>
It is not a "green card" in its original sense, but a reminder
for environmental protection. In three languages -- Chinese,
English and Japanese -- the document asks guests to help save
water and washing powder by putting unused towels on the rack, for
example.
</P>
<P>
Located at the southernmost tip of Hainan, Sanya is one of the
most popular tourist destinations in China, renowned for its clear
blue sea and white beaches. In the first half of this year,
780,000 Chinese and overseas tourists visited the city, a
year-on-year increase of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The environmental card is part of the "green service"
introduced by the local hotel association this year. Other
activities launched include "Clean the Beach" and "Protecting
Every Piece of Coral."
</P>
<P>
The card has been favorably received by most tourists, with
some even writing down on the card that the bed-sheets and
pillowcases did not need to be changed.
</P>
<P>
The green service has already produced results. One of the
hotels has announced that it has reduced wastewater by 30
percent.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Belgian police held a director
for a youth summer camp late on Wednesday for alleged pedophile
behavior, local television RTBF reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police detained the 35-year-old man in Londeel after picking up
in a forest three runaway campers who described "surprising
behavior" by the camp director who had previous offenses against
children in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Police did not disclose the identity of the alleged pedophile.
</P>
<P>
The court in Louvain has opened an investigation of the man for
indecent assault on minors with violence and threats.
</P>
<P>
Authorities already evacuated the 18-children camp and said
that the children were in good health and had not been raped. The
youngsters in the camp aged between eight and 14.
</P>
<P>
The news set off another shock wave in the country where an
infamous pedophile, Marx Dutroux, was arrested two years ago
around the same time as he kidnapped six children and killed four
of them.

<P>
ANKARA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning)
</P>
<P>
-- Germany has sold around 449.2 million marks (252.3 million
U.S. dollars) worth of weapons and military equipment to Turkey
during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This is regarded as a positive gesture from Bonn to Ankara
since last December when the German-Turkish relationship fell to
a freezing point due to Germany's negative attitude toward
Turkey's bid for full European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- In a report published on Thursday, the International
Monetary Fund urged the Turkish government to "act more
decisively" to bring down its soaring inflation rate, saying a
failure to achieve it would negatively affect Turkey's
cooperation with the Washington-based financial body.
</P>
<P>
High inflation rate, which stood at 80 percent at the end of
June, and the sharp devaluation of the Turkish currency lira have
become a major obstacle to Turkey's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- Security has been tightened around the U.S. Embassy in
Turkey following the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya and anonymous warnings received by the U.S. embassies
in Yemen, Malaysia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
All diplomats and workers have been warned against suspicious
foreigners, mails and other articles.

WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Tom Dolan returned to form
to win the 400-meter individual medley at the U.S. National
Swimming Championships in California on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dolan who suffered an asthma attack, finished 14th overall in
the 800-meter freestyle finals Tuesday night as "I just couldn't
breath after 300 meters."
</P>
<P>
But Dolan had no problems two days later, winning the 400
individual medley in 4 minutes 16.33 seconds, more than two
seconds ahead of second-placer Tom Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
"After this morning, I thought I was going to have a real good
swim in the finals," Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cristina Teuscher failed to make a double win when
she finished second in both the 200 freestyle and 400 individual
medley.
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Benko won the 200 freestyle in 2:00.67. Maddy Crippen
won the 400 individual medley in 4:42.61.

JERUSALEM, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak announced
Thursday that a national unity government is no longer on
the party's agenda and Labor will give top priority to
advancing early elections. This was Barak's first public statement
on the issue since the secret talks between him and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were revealed four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Avner Shalev, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial
in Jerusalem, was one of many Jewish leaders who expressed
satisfaction with the announcement of a comprehensive agreement
between Holocaust survivors and Swiss banks that will result in
1.25 billion U.S. dollars being paid out to settle Holocaust-era
claims. Shalev said that the agreement reached on Wednesday
"fulfills a moral debt to the Jewish people."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli rescue team returned home Thursday night from
its five-day mission in Kenya and received a hero's welcome.
However, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai did not take
part in the ceremony, apparently protesting Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's presence. Mordechai had proposed a modest
welcome ceremony, but Netanyahu did not agree.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China OKs Loans for Satellite-Launching Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) today
agreed to extend 1.5 billion yuan in loans to assist the country's
effort to launch more international commercial satellites.
</P>
<P>
The recipient of the loan, in export seller's credits, is the
China Great Wall Industry Corp., China's sole firm engaged in
satellite-launching services and international satellite
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Part of the funds are exempt from guarantee, something that
makes it easier for the corporation to more flexibly meet the
requirements of customers in satellite-launching services.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has issued 7.3 billion yuan in loans to Great Wall
since 1990, supporting the launching of 15 satellites.
</P>
<P>
Great Wall has signed long-term cooperative agreements with
Hughes Aircraft Corp., the largest supplier of commercial
satellites in the world, and with Loral Space Systems, another
major satellite supplier in the United States. Great Wall plans to
launch 15 international commercial satellites in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
In another measurement, the BOC has extended 26 billion yuan and
500 million U.S. dollars in export seller's credits since the
early 1980s to support China's exports of machinery and
electronics products.
</P>
<P>
To help counter the mounting effects of the Asian financial
crisis, the BOC will continue to lend great support to Chinese
exporters and to high-tech enterprises, a bank official said.

<HEADLINE> LPG Fuel For Buses In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua)-- Sixty buses using gasoline and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) appeared on Beijing's streets
Wednesday in densely-populated districts.
</P>
<P>
The new buses have LPG cylinders and another fuel system inside
and drivers can easily switch between the two.
</P>
<P>
More alternative fuel buses will be put into use in Beijing in
next several months because of growing environmental
consciousness. The Beijing Public Transit Co. plans to refit 1,000
buses by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the numbers are still small when compared with
Beijing's 1.3 million motor vehicles, buses produce the most
serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has only a fifth of the number of motor vehicles of
similarly-sized cities in the developed countries, but the amount
of exhaust gas from its vehicle is three to five times that of
other cities and its heavy vehicle emissions have earned Beijing a
prominent place among the world's top 10 polluted cities.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say that an LPG-powered vehicle puts out 92
percent less carbon monoxide than a gasoline vehicle for the same
power.

KAMPALA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 people in the flooded
areas of Lake Kyoga, 200 to 300 kms north of Uganda's capital
Kampala, now face starvation after floods destroyed their food
crops.
</P>
<P>
The floods, which started three months ago, forced the worried
local population to buy surviving food from Lira district to the
north of the lake, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said some two-kilometer-long roads had been cut off
by the flooding water and that people had to use canoes to cross
the flooded area.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, the Minister of Works, Housing and
Communication, who is on a two-day tour of feeder roads, railway
stations and post offices in the district, was quoted as assuring
the residents that the floating masses that have been blocking
the River Nile will be removed soon.
</P>
<P>
The overflow of the lake water is caused by a mass of sudds
that have blocked the Nile's exit from Lake Kyoga into Albert
Nile at Moone Landing site in the last couple of months.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has displaced over 15,000 people in the
neighboring districts. It also exerted much adverse influence on
fishing activities.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian team of experts have come to help remove the
blockage.

<HEADLINE> Rugova's Peace Move Praised by NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana has praised a peace-making move by the leader of the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement available early on Friday, the chief of the
western military alliance described Ibrahim Rugova's formation of
a five-member negotiation team as a "window of opportunity" for
peace in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Solana urged that the opportunity must not be allowed to pass
by.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to contribute positively to the peace process as well.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that negotiations are taken forward
quickly by both sides in a spirit of cooperation on the basis of
the proposals developed by the Contact Group," said Solana.
</P>
<P>
NATO's council of ambassadors met on Wednesday during the
summer recess to review the alliance's options for reactions to
the Kosovo crisis that has created a large number of refugees
either within the province or toward neighboring countries such as
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
NATO is to conduct a joint exercise in Albania next week and
earlier organized a multinational air-borne training in the
country as well to demonstrate its readiness to deploy preventive
forces should the situation arise.
</P>
<P>
However, the new negotiation team failed to include members
from the Kosovo Liberation Army that has been fighting the Serb
security forces for the past six months.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Foreign Companies About Interfering In VCD Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The deputy secretary-general of
the China Electronic Audio Industry Association in Shanghai, Jin
Zhenglong, has warned foreign firms about trying to apply their
standards for digital disc products and interfering in Chinese
state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Some international companies and local manufacturers have their
own standards for digital disc products, Jin said, and are
ignoring government warnings about trying to dominate the
fledgling industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign companies have said China needs to get their
approval for video compact disc products, or that the term "VCD"
cannot be used by Chinese companies, or have attempted to keep
China from developing its own technical standards.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies should not try to take control of China's
digital disc industry by using their technological and financial
muscle to force Chinese firms to adopt their standards, Jin said,
and added that, "We like to introduce advanced foreign technology,
but don't want to attach ourselves to any foreign company."
</P>
<P>
China has approximately 380 manufacturers of VCD players that
made more than 10 million players last year. In 1996, China worked
out technical standards for VCD products and last year began to
draw up technical standards for SVCD products. When these take
effect, they will apply to all VCD and SVCD products on the
Chinese market.

<P>
HARBIN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- One million civilians and
soldiers have been mobilized for a round-the-clock fight against
China's worst flooding on the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers
in the northernmost province of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m. today, the water level on the Songhua River at Harbin,
the provincial capital, rose as high as 119.15 meters, with a
water flow of 8,890 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Due to the severe situation, Harbin, also a leading industrial
and grain production center, set a curfew on several sections of
the Songhua River embankments.
</P>
<P>
Eight working teams have been dispatched to the
worst-affected areas to help with evacuation and relief work.
</P>
<P>
In Qiqihar, the city hardest hit by the Nenjiang River deluge,
250,000 people began fortifying the major embankment and 4,000

people to safe locations with no deaths reported, and consumed 12
million cubic meters of stone and earth plus more than 14.3
million sand bags.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Gains Economic, Financial Clout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Accelerated market reforms have
effectively assisted the aim of Shanghai to be an international
economic, financial and trade center, according to Mayor Xu
Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an average
of 13.8 percent in the last five years, 5.9 percent higher than
the average for all of the 1980s and 2-to-4 percent higher than
the national figure during the same period, Xu told Chinese
scientists and overseas scientists of Chinese origin attending a
recent international seminar.
</P>
<P>
Based on the current exchange rate, Shanghai's per capita GDP
has reached 3,000 U.S. dollars, the highest among all Chinese
provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years such sectors as finance, commerce, trade,
transportation, communication and real estate in Shanghai have
developed rapidly, turning Shanghai into an open and
multi-functional economic center from a pure industrial and
commercial city.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shanghai's securities, foreign exchange, technology,
metal and commodity futures markets have attained considerable
size, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that mandatory government orders have given way to
market forces in the distribution of resources, with the prices of
more than 95 percent of all industrial products and more than 90
percent of all production materials and farm produce determined by
the market.
</P>
<P>
A social security system that covers old age, unemployment and
medical care has been established and covers basically the whole
society, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Shanghai today has increasingly close ties
with the world economy, adding that imports and exports through
the Shanghai port totaled nearly 60 billion U.S. dollars last
year, about 20 percent of the national figure.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also indicate that more than 10,000
overseas-funded enterprises have opened in Shanghai, with paid-in
overseas investment hitting 21 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that Shanghai aims to have built a framework for an
international economic, financial and trade center by the start of
the next century.
</P>
<P>
This will help boost economic growth in the Yangtze River Delta
and the Yangtze River Valley as a whole, he said.

<HEADLINE> July Figures Show Steady Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's July investments in
fixed assets surged by 22.8 percent on the same period last year,
up 6.5 percentage points on the June figure, according to a
release issued today by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Retail sales for the period hit 228.6 billion yuan, up 8.1
percent on a year-on-year basis and 1.3 percentage points higher
than the June figure.
</P>
<P>
Economists note the indices indicate a rebound from a period of
sluggish economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During the January-July period, total fixed asset investments
for the January-July period hit 736.2 billion yuan, up 15.6
percent on the 1997 period, with the growth rate for retail sales
ending the period at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The SSB attributed lower industrial growth during July to
heavy flooding in southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The incremental industrial output for July rose by 7.6 percent
to 155.3 billion yuan, a drop of 0.3 of a percentage point on the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The July growth rate for exports increased slightly, with a
continuing fall in the rate for imports.
</P>
<P>
July exports worth 16.2 billion US dollars represented a 3.5
percent rise form the same period last year, with imports falling by
6.4 percent to 12 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The SSB also indicated a continual drop in the inflation rate,
with the July retail price index dropping by 3.2 percent and the
consumer price index by 1.4 percent from the same month in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The January-June retail price index fell by 2.2 percent and the

<HEADLINE> Shandong's Power Industry Marks 100th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- After 100 years of both slow and
rapid expansion, the power sector of east China's Shandong
Province has become one of the most developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Shandong now has the single largest independent power grid
among all of China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions. In 1996, it became the first in China to make electricity
accessible to every household. Shandong's daily power generation
exceeds 200 million kilowatts/hour (kwh), about the total of 1949,
the year when new China was founded.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's power sector started in 1898 when invading Germans
installed two diesel-engine, 50-horsepower generators to supply
electricity for German military facilities and institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the next five decades, the power industry of Shandong
advanced at a snail's pace due to invasion by several big Western
powers and the chaos caused by years of war.
</P>
<P>
However, Shandong's power sector has developed by leaps and
bounds since China launched its market economy reforms in the late
1970s, with annual power generation increasing by an average of 10
percent each year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Shandong's installed power generation
capacity totaled 16.5 million kilowatts (kw) while actual yearly
power generation hit 84 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shandong's power grid includes five power plants
with an installed capacity of more than one million kw each. The
Zouxian Power Plant in Zouxian County is the largest power plant
on the Chinese mainland with an installed capacity of 2.4 million
kw.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhenya, director of the Shandong Provincial Power Industry
Bureau, said the size of Shandong's power sector is large overall,
but that the province's power generation and consumption in per
capita terms are still at a relatively low level compared with
many other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Starting now, Shandong will increase its effort to develop
power resources and build and renovate the power grid, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's installed power generation capacity should exceed 20
million kw by the end of this century and annual power generation
is expected to reach 110 billion kwh, he added.
</P>
<P>
By year 2005, the two figures are expected to hit 30 million kw
and 150 billion kwh, respectively, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> 9,851 People in Inner Mongolia Remain Stranded by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 24,245 people stranded
by floods in the eastern part of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region have been moved to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
However, another 9,851 are still believed stranded in flooded
areas. Efforts are under way to evacuate them, an official from
the Regional Flood Control Headquarters said here today.
</P>
<P>
Unusually big floods on the Nenjiang River have hit 60 counties
and cities in eastern Inner Mongolia since August 8, leaving
410,000 people homeless. Officers and soldiers of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army and armed police rushed to flooded areas
and worked five days and nights to evacuate the stranded people.
</P>
<P>
The latest information from the regional flood control
headquarters said the water level in the main stream of the
Nenjiang River that flows on the eastern part of the region has
continued to rise, and the Chuo'er River, a tributary of the
Nenjiang, has been swollen to a dangerous level.
</P>
<P>
By 8 a.m. today, the Jiangqiao Hydrological Station on the
Nenjiang River recorded a water level of 142.04 meters and a water
flow of 12,700 cubic meters per second, but the water level is
expected to climb to 143 meters and the water flow to 15,000 cubic
meters per second or more.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the regional Committee of the
Communist Party of China, consulted with a newly formed
professional team consisting of a group of water control experts
about possible counter-measures.
</P>
<P>
To avoid fresh flooding, the water control experts have
proposed solidifying the one-kilometer-long section of embankment
built along the Chuo'er River, raising the existing
embankment' height, and using tarpaulins to protect the embankment
from wave action.
</P>
<P>
The counter-measures are now being carefully executed in
Hinggan League and Jalaid Banner, said local sources.

points, in reaction to the economic turmoil in Russia, a main
trade partner of Turkey, local newspaper Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Stock Exchange National-Index Thursday lost 242.2
points following the reports that the Moscow Stock Exchange's
Central Index had dived 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past four trading days, the market witnessed three days
of decline. It dipped by 5.81 percent on Monday, followed by a
further 7.35 percent tumble on Tuesday. The market only regained
some grounds by surging 3.55 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Moscow Stock Exchange index slid
after Hungarian-born leading investor George Soros told the
Financial Times on Wednesday that Russia should devalue its
currency by 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Daily News quoted Turkish investors as saying that a collapse
of the Russian economy could cripple hundreds of Turkish
companies with investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Scores of blue-chip Turkish companies doing business with
Russia are listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets around the world have been reeling as a result
of the growing Asian economic crisis, which began last summer
with the collapse of the currencies and stocks in Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia and then spread to other regions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government's possible sharp devaluation of the
Turkish Lira against Western currencies has also prompted
investors to sell shares on the market.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Central Bank Governor Gazi Ercel on Thursday
denied reports that the government would devalue the Turkish
lira, saying the bank was able to avoid a major devaluation
because it had accumulated 26 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
reserves to overcome the present crisis.

<HEADLINE> Residents near Breached River Section Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Residents living in areas
inundated by floods coming through a 60-meter breach on the
Yangtze River's main embankment have returned to their homes since
the breach was blocked on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
From the highest point of the city dike which stands 24 meters
above sea level, residents could be seen Friday going into their
houses 100 meters away from the breach.
</P>
<P>
People living in areas far behind the embankment returned from
temporary huts Thursday afternoon, said Ding Xinfa, an anti-flood
director.
</P>
<P>
In the nearest house, where floodwater has receded 1 meter from
the doorstep, a woman was in front of her house washing wooden
furniture stained by mud.
</P>
<P>
Next door a man and woman were having their meal on a
short-legged table. Clothes and bed sheets were fluttering in the
wind in front of the houses near the embankment.
</P>
<P>
Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
today poured 1,000 cubic meters of stone and clay at the site to
reinforce the framework blocking the breach. Efforts to prevent
leakage of water from the make-shift dike are under way.
</P>
<P>
The breach occurred on Aug. 7 at the Jiujiang section in east
China's Jiangxi Province. The 60-meter breach was cemented
completely on Wednesday after five days of strenuous work. More
than 3,000 residents had been evacuated from the region soon after
the breach was discovered.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the Jiujiang section had dropped to 22.61
meters by 8 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation experts are considering whether or not to
build a third defense dam in Jiujiang.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 200 reports from 95 media organizations --
including those from Hong Kong, Taiwan and countries in other
parts of the world -- are writing flood stories in the
city.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Practice of Public Notaries in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) - The Chinese Ministry of Justice
and the Hong Kong government will continue the current practice of
entrusting public notaries in Hong Kong to promote economic and
civil contracts between Hong Kong and the mainland, a ministry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference, Xiao Yishun, director of the
Public Notary Department of the ministry, said the ministry has
commissioned 200 notaries in Hong Kong by the end of 1997 since
the system was established in 1980. They have notarized 480,000
agreements so far.
</P>
<P>
These notarized documents are related to almost all civil and
economic issues, including marriage, inheritance and adoption, as
well as investments, trusts, real estate and trade, according to
the director.
</P>
<P>
"This practice makes it possible that a notarized document can
be accepted in the two different legal systems of Hong Kong and
the mainland, reducing the time and costs for repeated
confirmation of notarized documents and benefiting clients," Xiao
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the 17-year-old system has been supported by both
Hong Kong and mainland residents.
</P>
<P>
The system was originally initiated to promote the smooth
return of Hong Kong to the motherland. Because of its important
roles, top Chinese officials said that the system should remain
after the handover and that the new government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region said it will support the system as
well.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Justice, all the public notaries
on commission must be prestigious lawyers in Hong Kong and that
the qualification confirmation process is complicated and
rigorous.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expects 5.8 Pct GDP Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is expected to net an
5.8 percent growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed in a study conducted by the Bank of Ceylon
(Sri Lanka) which attributes this success to improvements in
economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The lately study says that the impact of this on business
confidence augurs well for Sri Lanka's economy despite the
unfavorable international economic scenario and the civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the agricultural, manufacturing and
construction, banking, insurance and real estate sectors will grow
significantly at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Paddy output is expected to increase significantly over last
year.  The continued spectacular performance of tea and the
rebound in minor agricultural export crops project an increase of
3.8 percent in agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
Tea output will reach the 280 million kilogram mark on the
basis of improved cultural practices and improved management
systems.
</P>
<P>
Donor confidence in Sri Lanka enabled the country to receive
700 million U.S. dollars for 1998/99 which is 80 million dollars
more than expected.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garments, the leading sub-sector in the export
sector, recorded a 10 percent growth in terms of U.S. dollars
during the first four months of the year. With improvements the
industry is likely to grow further.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's economy grew by 5.8 percent in the first quarter of
the year despite an increase of eight billion rupees (121 million
dollars) for defense, Deputy Finance Minister G.L. Peiris Thursday
told newsmen.
</P>
<P>
The country has 38 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange
reserves, enough for five months' imports, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the global economic environment is unlikely to
continue to be favorable, mainly due to the current Asian
financial crisis. This year the country's economic growth will be
low compared with last year, the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka enjoyed a growth of 6.4 percent in 1997, up from 3.8
percent in 1996.

facing the difficulties courageously.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan cannot compromise no its defense. If Pakistan
succumbed to international pressure these sanctions would be
lifted immediately but we are determined not to bow before these
pressures," he said.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Steel Plant Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A state-owned Myanmar steel plant
has been transferred to local private entrepreneurs for continuous
effective operation to promote the plant's production.
</P>
<P>
The Ywama Steel Plant of No.3 Myanmar Mining Enterprise in
Yangon, handed over on Thursday, is the largest industry
privatized since the country formed the Privatization Commission
in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The plant is also the initial venture in Myanmar, jointly
participated by successful national entrepreneurs,
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council, was quoted by Friday's
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who supervised the transfer arrangement, urged the
entrepreneurs to strive for emergence of cartels of heavy
industries and conglomerates in Myanmar as in other Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar announced in January 1995 the first-phase plan of
 privatization of 51 state-owned economic enterprises (SEEs) which
include different processing and manufacturing factories, cinemas
and livestock breeding farms, the privatization process has been
underway in various forms including auctioning and leasing out
the SEEs or establishing joint ventures with local and foreign
entrepreneurs or operating either under buy-back or counter-trade
system.
</P>
<P>
Up to July since the beginning of this year, about 140
state-run cinemas, some 42 factories and two livestock breeding
farms in the country have been designated to be sold through
competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills have been
reportedly privatized.

<P>
DHAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka Stock Exchange, Bangladesh's
premier bourse, went automatic Thursday, ending 44 years of floor
trading.
</P>
<P>
"The investors will regain their confidence and come back to
the market, if discipline is maintained strictly," Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said while inaugurating the automated
trading system, the national Financial Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister formally inaugurated the computerized
trading system through purchasing 50 shares by putting the switch
on from a local hotel.
</P>
<P>
Terming the system a "giant step" towards ensuring transparency
in capital market operations in the country, Kibria said it would
help the market greatly regain investors' confidence, as "the
market cannot be manipulated so easily."
</P>
<P>
He urged stock brokers and traders to abide by the rules and
regulations. "Once you become habituated to the regulatory system,
you will be able to do business at ease and comfort," he said.
</P>
<P>
More reforms were needed to ensure transparency in the capital
market, including introduction of a central depository system,
strengthening of the existing accounting and auditing system and
correct disclosure by listed companies, according to the finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
"If you do the things in the right way, the market will bounce
back by its own way," since "confidence cannot be brought back
artificially," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the exchange authorities to increase its membership
with a view to injecting new blood into it.
</P>
<P>
There are two stock exchange markets in Bangladesh at present -
the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Chittagong Stock Exchange.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- the International Monetary Fund

face of acute financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, the official
Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF sources were quoted as saying that the challenge now,
according to a review of the Sri Lankan economy by the IMF, is to
tighten fiscal and monetary policies to carry out reform of the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has commended the authorities for maintaining macro
economic stability in 1997 despite the continued civil strife and
a difficult regional environment and for making steady progress in
addressing structural weaknesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bucking a regional trend towards stagnation, Sri Lanka enjoyed
a growth of 6.4 percent from 3.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Overall growth was supported by a strong recovery in
agricultural production, higher exports of garments and textiles
and continued good performance in the services sector, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The broadening in the tax base has been recommended together
with revenue sharing measures to reduce reliance on sharp cuts in
social services and infrastructure spending, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has warned that the financial sector weaknesses in Sri
Lanka including the relationship between state and the banking
sector needed to be promptly identified and corrected.
</P>
<P>
In particular the IMF has called for the separation of the
commercial and non-commercial activities of the two state banks
and for their privatization as soon as possible, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Economists Forecast U.S. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S economy is expected
to grow by 3.4 percent in 1998, despite surging trade deficits and
the impact of the Asian financial crisis, according to the
consensus forecast by 19 leading Wall Street economists.
</P>
<P>
Bright prospects for the rest of 1998 are lower interest rates,
strong employment growth and gains in real disposable personal
income. These factors will continue to fuel the housing sector,
said the report published by the Bank of America on Thursday. The
economists also projected the trends of the U.S. economy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the panel believe the Federal Reserve will hold
interest rates steady through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a good
pace, with the real gross domestic product (GDP) expected to
average 3.4 percent in 1998. At the same time, inflation, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index, is expected to average 1.7
percent in 1998, and the unemployment rate is expected to average
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are also bad news for sectors of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
"A majority of our panelists believe that economic conditions
in Southeast Asia have yet to bottom, which could continue to
negatively impact U.S. exports to Asia," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The panel also believe that consumer confidence and capital
spending remain critical to U.S. growth prospects for the rest of
this year and into the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The economists project that the U.S. trade deficit will balloon
to 244 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. They expect corporate profits
to increase by just 1.8 percent, and industrial production to grow by
3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the economists seem more optimistic than they
were when they were surveyed last month. They said the
U.S. economy will grow at a modest pace in 1999 and predicted a
probability of 36 percent -- up two percentage points from last
month's survey -- that that would be the case.
</P>
<P>
The panel also predicted a probability of 29 percent that the
economy would be slowing down by next August. In addition, the
panel believed there is only a 20 percent probability the
U.S. economy will be booming a year from now, while there is a 15
percent probability that the economy will be experiencing
stagflation by next August -- a stagnating economy accompanied by
rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
During 1999, the economists predicted that inflation will rise
slightly to 2.3 percent and unemployment will remain low at 4.6
percent. Once again, the trade picture in 1999 will remain a
problem, with the trade deficit expected to exceed 284.9 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Accord on Holocaust-era Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday praised the agreement reached between Swiss
banks and Holocaust survivors and heirs of the victims while local
U.S. financial officers cancel plans to sanction the Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides demonstrated understanding, flexibility and
determination in reaching a settlement that... will bring long
delayed justice to Holocaust victims and their families," Clinton
said in a statement issued by the White House.
</P>
<P>
The deal, hammered out in a U.S. district court in Brooklyn,
New York, ended a three-year period of uncertainty as banks first
opposed, then finally conceded to an agreement to settle claims on
the missing assets.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, U.S. financial officers in New York canceled
plans to impose sanctions on the banks and other Swiss businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We are canceling our program of sanctions," New York City
Comptroller Alan Hevesi, head of a panel of 900 financial officers
from towns, cities and states across America, told a news
conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
"We also recognize that Holocaust issues remain with us and we
call on the Swiss government to join in spirit with this
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hevesi noted that other European countries aside from
Switzerland had "moral obligations" regarding the return of money
and valuables deposited in banks by Jews before, during and after
World War Two or looted by Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has legislation to create a commission to
examine the role of American banks on similar issues.
</P>
<P>
Despite the administration's opposition, the local financial
officers planned to impose sanctions on Swiss banks from September
1 unless the banks agreed to settle the claims of Jewish groups
and Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
Hevesi announced the plan on July 1 after a breakdown in
negotiations when the Swiss offered a 600 million U.S. dollars
settlement while Jewish groups wanted 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
About 20 states and 30 cities had been preparing potentially
harmful sanctions.
</P>
<P>
New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall told the same news
conference on Thursday that he was "delighted" to call off the
sanctions before they could take effect.
</P>
<P>
In California, State Treasurer Matt Fong, another leader of the
financial officer's group, also announced the lift of all
restrictions against his state doing business with Swiss banks
because of the settlement.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian capital city
military is soliciting help from foreign groups in its effort to
identify people spreading rumors on the Internet of renewed riots
in Jakarta, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"To detect (those responsible for) rumors on the Internet,
we've asked the assistance of foreign parties," Jakarta Military
Commander Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Djadja refused to elaborate on what he meant by "foreign
parties", but said a joint investigation was ongoing.
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet detected the rumormongers. The investigation
will take quite a long time and there will be many people to
testify. So, please be patient," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to National Police Detective Corps Commander Maj.
Gen. Da'i Bachtiar, his personnel have also been ordered to
investigate the rumors, which have spread throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have it that unrest will occur ahead of the August 17
Independence Day celebration.
</P>
<P>
Although police consider the rumors to be phony, security
officers have taken measures to anticipate any possible
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
"We're closely monitoring the current situation and at the same
time seeking the perpetrators, who have transmitted the rumors via
leaflets and the Internet," Da'i said.
</P>
<P>
Security has been noticeably strengthened this week, with fully
armed soldiers patrolling the capital in trucks and guarding
public buildings.

Security in particular areas has also been beefed up. Residents
have also been asked to tighten security in their respective
neighborhood and business areas.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Bank Signs 5-Year Service Pact with Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Development Bank of
China (SDB) will provide complete financial services for east
China's Anhui Province in the coming five years, said a bank source.
</P>
<P>
SDB President Chen Yuan said that the move represents the
bank's lastest attempt to improve the service of this
policy-oriented bank and to diversify management of assets.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed earlier this week, SDB will act as a
financial consultant for the province and its enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has been one of SDB's priorities. By the end of July, the
bank's outstanding loans to the province has totaled 14.6 billion
yuan involving 96 projects, mainly power and coal projects, which
accounted for 20 percent and 57 percent of the bank's total to the
province.
</P>
<P>
The bank has promised to offer 7 billion yuan in loans to
Anhui's power sector within the next three to five years mostly
for building of urban and rural electricity power grids.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in addition to financial services for the
infrastructure, basic and high-tech industries, SDB will provide
consultation on the province's adjustment of industrial structure,
enterprise restructuring, stock listings, bond issues, syndicated
loans and finding partners for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The bank, established in 1994, was created to aid the country's
infrastructural projects and basic industries. It has financed 80
percent of the country's key construction projects.
</P>
<P>
SDB approved loans worth 53.9 billion yuan between January and
June, up 24 percent over the corresponding period of last year.

HAIKOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon Penny has relieved
serious drought conditions in south China's island province of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon, instead of causing disasters, has brought badly
needed rains to the province.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the rains have relieved the province's
drought which began last spring. The drought has affected 72,000
hectares of farmland and caused a drinking water problem for
100,000 local residents.
</P>
<P>
Six cities have induced artificial rains with the help of
Penny.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said that over-reclamation of land and
deforestation have been major causes for the long-term drought in
the province.

BANGKOK, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Export industries in Bangkok and
15 surrounding provinces will be exempt from duty on imported
machinery, The Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI) decided
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The BOI hoped that the extra assistance for industries would
encourage foreign businesses to base their production in Thailand,
BOI Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanon was quoted Friday by the
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The tax waivers would help industries such as leather and
garments, which lacked BOI incentives, Staporn said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ventures without BOI privileges would be allowed to
claim tax rebates on imported raw materials used for making
exports.
</P>
<P>
The BOI would also establish a center to help foreign investors
buy or take over the interests of cash-strapped Thai companies, he
said.

LIMA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran troops that infiltrated
Peru are now surrounded by Peruvian forces, said a Peruvian source
Thursday.

<P>
The source said the Peruvian troops, which were five times

The source added that an opening had been left for the
Ecuadoran troops to retreat to their country.

A report, quoted by the press, said the Ecuadoran forces,
composed of about 300 soldiers, had entered through nine border
points 2.8 kilometers into the eastern watershed of the El Condor
mountain range.
</P>

It added that the Ecuadoran soldiers had not built any kind of
defensive works, which indicates that the infiltration occurred
quite recently.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Warns of Possible Red Tide at Yangtze River Mouth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has warned
that the long-term flooding on the Yangtze River is likely to
result in a red tide at the river's mouth.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jingzhong, a professor with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that the floods will lead to a surplus of nutrients
at the mouth of the river.
</P>
<P>
"There has already been a surplus of nutrients in the region,"
he said. "Survey results show that the content of nitrogen in the
river in the 1990s is six times as much as that in the 1960s."
</P>
<P>
The big floods will bring muddy water rich in nitrogen and
phosphorus to the river mouth, worsening the problem of nutrient
surplus in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The scorching weather this summer has also provided a conducive
environment for a red tide, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, at the river's mouth, endured temperatures exceeding
38 degrees Celsius for four consecutive days through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou warned that the biological, physical, chemical and weather
conditions are conducive to a red tide. "Relevant departments
should increase monitoring and take immediate measures once red
tides take place so as to reduce losses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Red tides are caused by a heavy buildup of planktons that
release toxic substances which consume oxygen and suffocate fish.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Readjust Water Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Water charges in Beijing,
capital of China, will be averagely raised from 0.92 yuan (0.11 US
dollars) to 1.22 yuan (0.15 US dollars) per ton, according to a
plan reported by China Daily today.
</P>
<P>
The plan is now under the approval of the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second water price rate adjustment this year, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has long suffered from a shortage of water. The per
capita possession of water resources in this city is less than 300
tons, only one-eighth of the national average.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, water used for restaurants, the
entertainment industry and washing cars will be increased from 1
yuan (0.12 U.S. dollars) to 1.5 yuan (0.18 U.S.dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The charge for the water for other uses will increase from 0.7
yuan (0.08 U.S. dollars) to 1 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
A hearing concerning the readjustment was held on July 21 by
the Beijing Pricing Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The increase in water charges aims at encouraging Beijingers to
use water economically.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Security has been beefed up in
some of Indonesia's cities prior to August 17 Independence Day
celebrations, local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the country's second largest city of Surabaya, security
personnel were seen guarding a number of shopping malls and
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Brawijaya Regional Military Commander Maj. Gen. Djoko Subroto,
who oversees security in East Java province, met with 300 Moslem
ulemas Thursday to ask for their help in maintaining calm and
order.
</P>
<P>
He called on them to tell their respective communities that the
 authorities were fully in control of the situation and not to be
agitated by rumors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Djoko also met with members of the ethnic
Chinese community in Surabaya and urged them not to listen to
vicious rumors of impending violence.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there has been a reported increase in flight
reservations out of Surabaya for the next three days.
</P>
<P>
In Semarang, capital of Central Java province, more security
forces were put on alert to guard the city.
</P>
<P>
City police chief Col. Soenarko told reporters that security
had been beefed up since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Undercover teams comprised of selected officers have also been
stationed at trouble-prone spots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local military commander Lt. Col. Supriyanto called on the
public to participate in safeguarding their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Reports of unrest have already surfaced in West Java province.
Soldiers had to fire warning shots to disperse hundreds of people
late Wednesday after they looted several ethnic Chinese-owned
shops and burned a discotheque in two West Java towns.
</P>
<P>
In Labuan, 150 kilometers southwest of Jakarta, mobs looted
three shops after a customer argued with a storekeeper over the
price of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
Later that evening a mob in the nearby town of Serang burned a
hotel discotheque suspected of harboring prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
The mobs were dispersed only after two platoons of the Army's
Special Force approached the site, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In the holiday resort island of Bali, Deputy Governor Ahim
Abdurahim told reporters that the island had been "invaded" by
Chinese-Indonesians seeking refuge from possible unrest.
</P>
<P>
"For those who feel unsafe in their place of domicile, it would
be natural for them to pick Bali as an alternative place of
residence," he said.

Los Angeles, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven bodies have been found
in the Southern California desert, about 90 miles east of San
Diego near the Mexican border, local authorities reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seven -- five men, a woman and a teenage boy -- probably
died of heat exhaustion and appeared to have been dead for at
least three days, said Bill Strassberger, spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The daytime high temperature is over 38 centigrade degrees in

<P>
"The assumption was they died of heat exposure," Strassberger

neighboring Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Each year, scores of illegal immigrants die attempting to cross
into the United States in the rugged Southern California terrain.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Association Withdraws Unfair Labor Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The NBA Players Association
today withdrew its unfair labor practice charge against the NBA,
according to a report from New York.
</P>
<P>
The NBPA filed the labor complaint before the National Labor
Relations Board, claiming the league unilaterally changed the
terms and conditions of employment for the players when it
instituted a lockout.
</P>
<P>
However, hours before the complaint was to be heard by NLRB
regional director Daniel Silverman, the Players Association opted
to withdraw the charge.
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a defeat for the union's strategy of
litigation instead of negotiation," said NBA Deputy Commissioner
Russ Granik. "The players must now recognize that the NBA lockout
is completely lawful, and the only way it will end is when the
parties sit down and reach a deal that is fair to both sides."
</P>
<P>
The union cited time and expenses as the reasons for
withdrawing the complaint. "After consulting with the NBPA, it
was determined that the players would not be able to achieve
relief as swiftly as would be necessary to justify the effort and
expense of litigation," said Pete Stergois, outside counsel to
the NBPA.
</P>
<P>
Despite the withdrawal of the unfair labor charge, NBPA
executive director Billy Hunter made it clear today that the
players remain unified against the lockout. The union currently
has a grievance before arbitrator John Feerick requesting the
guaranteed contracts of players be paid during the lockout. The
grievance hearing is scheduled for August 24-25.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, the only serious collective bargaining session
since the lockout was held, but ended with owners walking out on

<HEADLINE> China Speeding Up Human Genome Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China plans to inject at least
250 million yuan (30 million U.S. dollars) within the next three
years to support human genome studies.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the project said they will engage in research
on genes related to major diseases.
</P>
<P>
Two big human genome research centers in Beijing and Shanghai,
which are jointly sponsored by the government and businesses, will
soon carry out studies with a focus on identifying and cloning
genes related to liver cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 laboratories across the country are involved in
the sequencing and analysis of human genes.
</P>
<P>
China's investment in the human genome project (HGP) will
increase to 300 million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars) by 2000, 10
times the total investment up to 1996, said Professor Qiang Boqin,
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"It shows at least in one dimension that China is trying to
speed up its human genome studies," Qiang said.
</P>
<P>
However, the greatly increased funding may not narrow the gap
between China's HGP research and the world's advanced level in a
short period of time, experts said, adding that the only way China
can make a bigger contribution to the world HGP project lies in
the study of disease-related genes.

<P>
The world's HGP research started in the United States in 1990,
and should be finished by 2005. Under the project, scientists are
trying to identify all the 100,000 human genes and interpret their
genetic codes.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that only about 5 percent of human genes are
useful in the study of disease, which have attracted many medical
experts and received large amounts of money from pharmaceutical
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Researchers in China hope that they can find 1,000 such genes
by the year 2001, and identify and clone the functional genes
linked to 5-to-10 major diseases," said Chen Zhu, director of the
Shanghai Human Genome Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Since the HGP started in China in 1993, Chinese scientists have
completed the study on the genome diversity of Han nationality
people, and 12 ethnic minority groups in China. Progress has also
been made in the study of genes related to leukemia, and
esophagus, liver and nosopharygeal cancers.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the human genome studies in China, where there is a
large variety of diseases, will take the identifying of genes
related to diseases with a high incidence rate and major hazard as
its major direction.
</P>
<P>
China will try to follow the latest development of human genome
research in the world, while improving the research and
international exchanges on ethical problems related to genetic and
biological science, he said.

<HEADLINE> Peters Dismissed as New Zealand Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Winston Peters has been
dismissed as New Zealand deputy prime minister and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Peters was announced here Friday by New
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
in the statement, Shipley said she had advised the
governor-general to dismiss Peters immediately from his
ministerial responsibilities as deputy prime minister and
treasurer. On her advice, the governor-general has appointed Bill
Birch to the office of treasurer. Birch will also continue as
minister of finance.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said she has set out the reasons for the dismissal in a
letter to Peters. In the letter, the New Zealand prime minister
said: "It is my view that you have shown a refusal to accept
Cabinet collective responsibility. Further, you have publicly
criticized Government policy regarding the sale of the Crown's
shareholding in Wellington Airport, and your actions and
statements regarding the sale were unacceptable. Further, your
unfounded allegations in the Parliament that I have breached some
alleged undertakings make it untenable for you to remain as a
Cabinet Minister."
</P>
<P>
Shipley said in the statement that she had the responsibility
to the country to ensure that the Cabinet was able to perform its
functions and duties in accordance with the important principle of
collective responsibility. "That is critical in maintaining public
confidence in executive decision-making and the reputation of New
Zealand," she said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said that she had written to all other
ministers from New Zealand First, informing them that they would
retain their ministerial responsibility and asking each of them to
meet her and to give her a personal commitment that they
understand the obligations of collective responsibility and to
give her an undertaking they are willing to comply with those
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The latest public disputes between Shipley and Peters was
triggered by Peters' walkout of a special Cabinet meeting
Wednesday night as a decision was about to be taken to sell the
government's stake in the Wellington Airport. The walkout was
followed by an exchange of accusation of each other through the
local TV station and extraordinary scenes of acrimony between the
two in Parliament Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Vehicle Sales Plunge in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Commercial vehicle sales in the
Philippines dropped 38.7 percent to 26,995 units in the first
seven months of this year compared with the year-ago level,
according to the latest industry figures.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here Friday, the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc. said that total vehicle
sales during the same period declined 46.1 percent to 49,997 units
from 97,756 units reported a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The chamber earlier reported a 52.8-percent decline in the
sales of passenger cars from January to July this year.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of the local automotive industry was
blamed on the economic crisis which pushed up interest rates and
prompted banks to impose stricter loan requirements.
</P>
<P>
With crisis still far from over, automotive assemblers forecast
the sales to remain dismal for the remaining months of the year.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the continued depreciation of the local
currency against the dollar could result in a new round of price
increase -- a scenario that could further discourage buyers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Volunteer Group Seeks U.N. Help to Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Volunteers of
Humanity had asked a United Nations subcommission in Geneva to
send a team of international investigators to probe the causes of
the May riots, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We requested the subcommission recommend members of the
International Commission of Jurists come to help us here,"
Catholic priest Sandyawan Sumardi, secretary of the volunteer
group, told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They received a positive response, he said, adding that he
could not say when a final decision would be made.
</P>
<P>
"We have just arrived (from our trip) so we are still waiting
for their answer. But I believe they will grant our request,"
Sandyawan said.
</P>
<P>
The volunteer group returned at the weekend from an overseas
trip which included a hearing in front of the U.N. Subcommission
on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
They also presented their findings on the May riots in Jakarta
and other cities to United States Congressmen in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The volunteer group was the first to reveal the true extent of
the devastating riots which left at least 1,200 people dead and
thousands of buildings destroyed or looted.
</P>
<P>
The targeting of ethnic Chinese establishments and the sexual
abuse of women were also disclosed as a feature of the unrest. It
was reported that the total number of victims of rape and sexual
harassment from the rioting reached 168.
</P>
<P>
"The riots were not a matter of racism but designed by certain
groups and used ethnic issues to trigger people's anger,"
Sandyawan said.
</P>
<P>
Sandyawan admitted that one reason he called for an
international team to come was his doubt that the government's own
team would succeed in it work.
</P>
<P>
He said the arrival of the international jurists would enable a
fair investigation on the riots to proceed.

<HEADLINE> Italy Selling More Enterprises to Pay for Public Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from the sale of Italy's
public enterprises to slash its soaring public debt more than
trebled in 1997 over the previous year, the Audit Court said in a
report on the Treasury on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The privatization income amounted to 34.673 trillion lire (20
billion U.S. dollars), up 275 percent from 1996, when the total
9.226 trillion lire (5.3 billion dollars) marked a 10.4 percent
increase over 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Large industries sold by the Italian government in 1997
included the petrochemicals group Eni, the San Paolo banking
group, Telecom and Seat, the yellow pages publisher of Italy's
former telecommunications utility Stet.
</P>
<P>
The selling of public enterprises became the government's most
important means of reducing public debt. Of the privatization
revenues in 1997, 24,6 trillion lire (14 billion dollars) would be
used to pay off public debt.
</P>
<P>
The Audit Court said that privatization revenues had so far
contributed some 60.624 trillion lire (35 billion dollars) to the
Public Debt Reduction Fund which was founded in 1994, including
some revenues available in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 revenues included 24.45 trillion lire (13.9 billion
dollars) from the first flotation of Telecom stocks, and five
trillion lire (2.8 billion dollars) from Eni2, or the second sale
of Eni shares.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 14 (Xinhua) -- For several decades a Uygur teacher
in Turpan, a city in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said he
has dreamed of flying his own plane in the blue sky as free as an
eagle.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla Kadir's dream has come true. In his self-made
airplanes, "Turpan No.1" and "Turpan No.2," Abdulla has already
made successful flights and "Turpan No.3" is nearly ready in his
grape-trellised yard.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla's house, in Munak Village of Turpan, resembles an
airplane museum. At the gate, the seven-meter "Turpan No.2" is
parked under a mulberry tree. In the yard, a newly made wing hangs
on a grape trellis and the unfinished project is lying on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla, 41, a Uygur teacher at Xinjiang Turpan Normal School,
said that besides his own interests he was making planes for the
children.
</P>
<P>
"Turpan is still a quite closed place," he said. "Most children
here have never seen an airplane. Sometimes during class, when a
plane roared over the school, all the students rushed to the
windows and watched until it was out of sight. Thus I thought that
how wonderful that would be if there was a plane for children to
watch and touch."
</P>
<P>
Abdulla began building his first plane in 1986. With the
plane model and physical knowledge he gained from the university,
he finished the drawings of the plane after thousands of
calculations and tests.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of building planes was a problem for Abdulla, who
has to support a family of seven people on a salary of several
hundred yuan every month.

<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zeming
and Premier Zhu Rongji on Friday congratulated the Republic of
Korea (ROK) on its 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to ROK President Kim Dae-Jung , President Jiang
said China and the ROK have witnessed remarkable developments in
bilateral relations since they established diplomatic ties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was confident that the friendly relations of the
two countries, established on the basis of five principles of
peaceful co-existence, would be strengthened and further developed.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu in his telegram to ROK Acting Prime Minister Kim
Jong-pil said developing good-neighborly relations between China
and the ROK was in line with the interests of the peoples of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
He added he would like to make joint efforts with the ROK
acting prime minister to further strengthen and develop the
existing friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also sent a
congratulatory message today to his ROK counterpart Hong
Soon-young on the republic's national day.
</P>
<P>
He said in his telegram that he wished the existing friendly
relations between the two countries and the two foreign ministries
would be further strengthened and developed.

<P>
To reduce the cost, he tried to make all the parts himself
except for the engine. In his spare time, he often went to the
salvage station to find scrap steel and iron. Using this material,
he welded the body of the plane and built the wings.
</P>
<P>
It took Abdulla 11 years to finish "Turpan No.1" and cost him
15,000 yuan and all his spare time. The plane weighs 190 kilograms
and is 6.5 meters long with a wing span of 11.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Abdulla made his maiden flight. Although the plane
only flew about 5 meters at a height of one meter, Abdulla said
that his heart was throbbing with excitement.
</P>
<P>
Just before July 1, 1997, when China resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Abdulla decided to contribute his
plane to the country.
</P>
<P>
On June 23 of last year, "Turpan No.1" was sent to Beijing by
train where it was on display in the National Space and Aviation
Museum.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla said that the speed of "Turpan No.2" could reach 80 to
120 kilometers per hour at a height of 3,000 meters, but he dared
not climb higher than 100 meters due to his amateurish pilot
skills.
</P>
<P>
At first, Abdulla's wife, Ayixam, and his elderly mother
worried that it was too dangerous to fly. But they did not succeed
in persuading him to give up his dream.
</P>
<P>
Abdulla's son, Ahat, 10, is also interested in planes. His
small planes made of plastic foam can be found scattered under the
grape trellis.
</P>
<P>
"My planes are simple and crude," Abdulla said. "But as long as
they can arouse children's interest in science, I'm very much
satisfied."

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rican Social Democrat
opposition Thursday criticized the government's way of handling
relations with Nicaragua, which are considered tense at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians of the National Liberation Party accused the
government of sending the Costa Rican Public Security minister to
negotiate an agreement with the Nicaraguan defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed on July 30, regulates the transit of
Costa Rican police on the San Juan River border, which belongs to
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan acting foreign minister Wednesday sent a note to
the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry voiding the agreement, which
renewed the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua refuses to permit the transit of Costa Rican
policemen with weapons on the river. The Costa Rican Foreign
Ministry said the Nicaraguan decision violates the right to free
navigation.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has exacerbated the situation and threatens to
damage relations between the two countries, which are also
experiencing tensions caused by immigration.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 600,000 Nicaraguans live in Costa Rica,
but most of them are without documents.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government reiterated that it will seek ways to
avoid any confrontation with the Nicaraguan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Juan Rafael Lizano said Thursday that
the changing of the guard in the four Costa Rican police posts are
being made on land, instead of using the river as done in the past.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want problems with the Nicaraguan army," said
Lizano. He also said that trade through the river continues as
usual. "The only restrictions are on public security and police
boats.
</P>
<P>
"The river is open, Nicaragua respects the free transit. the
only problem is for the uniformed ones," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Steps up Efforts to Cope With Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government is stepping
up efforts to reduce the impact of the drought affecting the
island nation these past months.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 50.5 million U.S. dollars to
alleviate the damage incurred to livestock as well as agriculture
and aquaculture, said a government news release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cattle are among the most frequent and hardest hit victims,
which comprise a large concentration in the eastern provinces
where the drought is the most serious.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of water facilities such as dams, small reservoirs,
and wells have dried up. As a result, drinking water for more than
300,000 head of cattle has to be transported by water tankers.
</P>
<P>
Herds of cattle have also been taken to new areas where they
can graze on green grass.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has decided to increase the imports
of rice, milk, and vegetables to make up for agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Meteorology Institute say that the total
precipitation this year was only 200 millimeters by July, just 12
percent of the annual median.
</P>
<P>
The extended heat wave, often over 35 degrees centigrade, made
the drought worse, said the institute.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Approves Incentives for Banks' Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has approved a set of guidelines for fresh incentives
to encourage banks to merge or consolidate their resources, a
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying
Thursday that the new incentives for mergers and consolidation
were earlier approved by the Monetary Board, the highest
policy-making body of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The new incentives are aimed at strengthening the banking
system by encouraging stronger players amid the difficult economic
environment triggered by the continuing Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, the incentives will also apply to
buy-outs or the acquisition by a bank of majority stake of up to
100 percent of another bank. Mergers mean that the two banks will
each own 50 percent of the merged bank.
</P>
<P>
The incentives include a one-year extension from compliance
with the additional 2 percent loan loss provision which banks were
earlier required by the central bank to meet within the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said merged banks
will now be given three years or an additional one year to comply
with the rule.
</P>
<P>
Other incentives include flexibility in meeting the 20-percent
cap on property loans, waiver of shareholding limit, and
restructuring of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been making efforts to strengthen the
country's banking system following the breakout of the Asian
financial crisis last year which has led to the closure of four
small Philippine banks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House to Limit Access to Report on Lewinsky Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Anticipating an impeachment
report next month from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, leaders
of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives
are planning to restrict access to sensitive evidence by changing
a current rule that would let all 435 House members review it.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're supportive of it," Representative John Boehner,
a Republican and a member of the leadership was quoted as saying
by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an unidentified Democratic committee official said
that party's leadership and Representative John Conyers of
Michigan, the Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat, would back
the change.
</P>
<P>
Starr is reportedly expected to focus the report solely on
evidence of perjury, obstruction of justice and witness tampering
in the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
But no decisions are expected to be made until after President
Bill Clinton, the last central witness, gives his account to a
grand jury via closed-circuit television on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The law under which Starr was appointed requires that such a
report be based on "substantial and credible evidence" that the
president committed an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
Any report Starr sends to Congress would form the basis for
lawmakers to decide whether to begin an impeachment inquiry that
could lead to a vote on whether to remove Clinton from office. But
many lawmakers have signaled that such proceedings probably
wouldn't start until next year.
</P>
<P>
The goal for House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a
Republican, initially will be to confine access to the report to
members of his committee so sensitive evidence will be
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
A resolution will be offered to the House floor to change the
current rule that gives any House member access to the report, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Petroleum Industry Pursuing Profit Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- China's petrochemical industry
is ready to claw and scrape to reach bottom line profits this
year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper said that the State
Petrochemical Industry Bureau (SPIB) has drawn up a plan to boost
production and sales in the sector, which included concrete steps
to be taken by the restructured China National Petroleum Corp
(CNPC) and China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec).
</P>
<P>
The plan forecasts that onshore crude oil output this year will
reach 143.13 million tons, 1.14 percent higher than the
previously-set target.
</P>
<P>
Processed oil output is expected to reach 159 million tons,
down 6.31 percent from previously set goals and 1.14 percent lower
than output last year.
</P>
<P>
The state petrochemical board will be in charge of supervising
production, refining, anti-smuggling and importing work of the two
petrochemical conglomerates over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The central government, under the pressure of achieving 8
percent of overall economic growth, demanded at least 10 billion
yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) in this year's profits for the
petrochemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the two petrochemical groups reported 17.5 billion
yuan (2.108 billion US dollars) in total profits, contributing
considerably to the nation's tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said ongoing heavy flooding along the Yangtze River
and in Northeast China would affect operation of some large oil
exploration enterprises. The State petrochemical bureau has
yet to downgrade its expectations for the industry, the paper
reported.

BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to use
200 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans for its second
phase of environmental improvements in urban areas.
</P>

treatment plants, which will be able to handle 300,000 tons of
sewage daily.
</P>
<P>
About 10 million U.S. dollars will be used for 20 LPG stations
for motor vehicles and to convert 10,000 buses and taxis to LPG

<HEADLINE> Interview: Mahathir Says World to Enter New Millennium  with Bad Economies (1)  By Wu Dingbao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has expressed his hope that the advent of the
21st century would lead to prosperity for the whole world, however
he anticipated that the world will enter the new millennium with
bad economies.
</P>
<P>
"First I am very hopeful that it (the advent of the 21st
century) will lead to prosperity for the whole world. I did not
believe in the so-called Asia century. I thought there will be a
world century, but now I am not so sure. I think the world will
enter the new millennium with the very bad economies," he said in
an exclusive interview with Xinhua here Thursday, with clear
reference to the current economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
When asked to give his views on what major changes he observes
would take place in the world power structure in the next century,
Mahathir said there will be a multiple power structure in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that at first the world would be dominated by "certain
world powers", but they will fail because other centers of power
will emerge including China.
</P>
<P>
"China, because of its size and because of its capacity, will
become a world power, and that will balance the other powers.
There will be multiple power structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also agreed that Japan would be one of the powers in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
Asked how ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
could be developed in the next century, Mahathir said ASEAN will
consolidate.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We will learn form each other and we will help each
other to develop and with that we can be very good market for
ourselves and for the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
But Mahathir said he did not think ASEAN would be a power
center in the next century because he said "we are small
countries." "But we will be able to stabilize the region," he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
On how fast the crisis-affected Asian economies would recover,
he said, "It is very difficult to say. For as long as the currency
traders can play around with our currencies and for as long as the
hot money can come in, there really is no stability, so we seek to
regulate the flow of capitals and ensure they are not
destructive."
</P>
<P>
"It will take time for the economies to recover for the whole
world," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
For Asian vitalization, Mahathir said that "Firstly Asian
countries must cooperate with each other... The Asians must be
allowed to come together, at least to discuss common problems. by
that way we can be much stronger and be able to protect
ourselves."
</P>
<P>
When asked what concrete ideas he has for the international
financial system reforms, Mahathir said that firstly, currency
trading must be completely transparent and there must be a proper
place for the currency traders to do the trading and they must be
registered.
</P>
<P>
There must be regulations for example to what extent currencies
can devalue or revalue, Mahathir said, adding that also the
currency traders must give proper reasons for the devaluation.
</P>
<P>
On why Malaysia's currency and stock market continue to
fluctuate or even further plunge, Mahathir, who for long blamed
the currency traders for manipulation in currency and stock
markets, said the fluctuation in currency and stock market "has
nothing to do with the way we run the economy of this country".
</P>
<P>
"For them (currency traders), it is merely a matter of making
money for themselves. So since they can make money by devaluing
our currency and reducing the share prices they will continue to
do so.
</P>
<P>
"And they may give any kind of excuse, although these excuses
are irrelevant. What we are doing for ourselves is to minimize the
effects of the currency manipulation and share price reduction and
then enabling us to continue without having to ask for help from
IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who repeatedly said Malaysia would depend on its own
efforts for the economic recovery, spelt out Malaysia's strong
points, "Fundamentally we are still very strong. The most
important thing for us is political stability and strong support
of the government by the people of this country, that means we can
take measures which will be fully supported."

<TEXT>
<P>
When asked what new measures his government will take for a
quick recovery, Mahathir said, "A quick recovery is very
difficult. But we will recover through increasing our trade, and
not using the U.S. dollar, because we do not have U.S. dollars and
in any case if you buy U.S. dollars to pay for our trade, the U.S.
dollar will appreciate some more. So we have now reached
agreements with many countries to trade in our own currencies."
</P>
<P>
On how Malaysia under his leadership would be developed in the
next century, Mahathir first said he did not know how long he
would be the leader in the next century, then he said if he
continues to be in power, "we will continue to ensure growth in
order to achieve our 2020 vision. We want to become a fully
developed country by the year 2020 and if we can overcome the
currency crisis, we would be developing industrially and
particularly information technology sector in order to be a fully
developed country."
</P>
<P>
On how he envisages the Sino-Malaysian relationship in the next
century, Mahathir said, "I think it will continue to be good. it
is good now. We have very little differences and we do not
interfere in each other's internal affairs. The trade will grow
and economic cooperation will also grow. There will be more
investments in each other's country."
</P>
<P>
For the future development of the bilateral relations between
China and Malaysia, Mahathir said, "Our interest will be in the
economic field. We would like to invest more in China and we would
like China to invest here. We must increase trade between the two
countries, and we should cooperate with each other in facing the
difficult years ahead."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "We are very happy that China is very stable and
I think China's stability is very important not only for China
itself but also for the region. So I hope that even though you are
democratizing, this should not result in instability for China."
</P>
<P>
Touching on the reported market fear on possible devaluation of
the Chinese currency Renminbi, Mahathir said, "I am very grateful
that China has not devalued its currency so far."
</P>
<P>
"But of course, even if you devalue a little, it would not hurt
us much because I think the difference is not so great. The
situation is now different from one year ago. One year ago, if
China had devalued its currency, it would have had very serious
consequences. But today, because other currencies are devalued too
far, even yuan devalues a bit, it will not affect us so much,"
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his concern about whether China can sustain the
pressure of no devaluation, especially as Japan has effectively
devalued.

BEIJING, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Four people suspected of selling
pornographic and pirated CD-Rom discs have been apprehended by the
Beijing Public Security Bureau.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sweden and UN to Beef up Military Presence in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government decided
Thursday to keep its United Nations peacekeeping force in
Macedonia and bolstered its military presence in the Balkan state
to 112 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force has been in Macedonia since 1992 in an effort to
prevent Bosnia's civil war from spilling out of the borders of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Due to the escalating situation in the Serb province of Kosovo,
the U.N. has also decided to beef up its military force in
Macedonia to prevent a full-blown conflict from spreading into the
country -- which has not yet been drawn into the on-again
off-again war in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. military presence has successfully contributed to
this," said Swedish Defense Minister Bjoern von Sydow.

<P>
HENAN, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A major state-owned textile mill
in central China's Henan Province, which went bankrupt with a
heavy debt, has been sold at auction for 166 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The deal marks the first such case for indebted state
enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Zhengzhou No.2 Textile Mill has been honored as
the cradle of the province's textile industry. It went into the
red, however, in the 1990s and bankruptcy was announced in
February this year when it recorded a debt of 264 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The deal for the mill, whose liability-to-asset ratio reached
138 percent, was made during the second round of bidding the
auction, which opened at 180 million yuan but stirred no response.
</P>
<P>
The buyer, the Gaoyue Group, assured basic social welfares for
the mill's staff members.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The "Dawn Project," which
subsidizes promising young scholars at Shanghai-based colleges and
universities, has already proven its worth. The first group of 83
beneficiaries are becoming bellwethers of their respective

<HEADLINE> Overseas-Funded Businesses Growing In South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province added 2,115 overseas-funded enterprises during the first
half of this year, involving 7.05 billion U.S. dollars of
investment, a nearly 97 percent rise from the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
The growing business is attributed to local promotion of
preferential policies such as taxation exemptions for overseas
investors and an improved local investment environment.
</P>
<P>
An increasing amount of overseas spendings is flowing into
local agricultural and industrial areas, while the amount into the
service sector is decreasing.
</P>
<P>
The number of new overseas-funded businesses involving
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing and water
conservation soared 51.2 percent from the same period of 1997,
while the number in manufacturing climbed 44 percent. The number
in commerce and catering dropped 31.6 percent, and the number in
real estate fell 22.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total enterprises, 63 cost more than 10 million
U.S. dollars each and are mainly owned by overseas investors. The
enterprises focus on such businesses as manufacturing, power,
construction, storage, transportation, posts and
telecommunications and social services.
</P>
<P>
Two Sino-Japanese joint ventures producing automobiles and
motors cost more than 200 million U.S. dollars and 100 million
U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
More than 71.4 percent of the enterprises, or 1,539, are funded
by investors from Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Vialli to Sue Over Drugs Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Gianluca Vialli said on Thursday
that he will sue Zdenek Zeman after the Roma coach indirectly
linked him with drug-taking in the Italian league.
</P>
<P>
Zeman made the comments in an Italian magazine last week
claiming that drugs were rife in Serie A. And he said some
Juventus players had gained muscle mass surprisingly quickly.
</P>
<P>
But Vialli who spent four years with the Turin club before
joining Chelsea in 1996, said: "I will not speak in detail about
it as it has nothing to do with football.
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad when things come up which are nothing to do
with the game. But I'm old enough and strong enough to handle it.
I just hope it will be cleared up soon.
</P>
<P>
"If someone has made a mistake then they must pay for it, but
it will not be me."
</P>
<P>
Italian striker Pierluigi Casiraghi, who arrived at Chelsea
this year from Rome club Lazio, also refuted Zeman's claims: "The
Roma manager has talked about doping but I do not believe that
would not help anyone's game," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He started talking about doping and now he has changed his
allegations to pharmaceutical substances. Some drugs are openly
available in supermarkets and as long as they are legal then I do
not see there being a problem. But I don't think there is any
problem with illegal drugs in Italy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Concept Of Marriage Changing In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shanghai, August 14 (Xinhua) -- As China opened wider to the
outside world in recent years, the people of the city of Shanghai
have kept pace and responded by changing their ideas about
marriage, according to a Civil Affairs Department study.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, people here are no longer necessarily content
with just marrying the girl or boy next door, and the number of
people marrying someone from outside Shanghai is on the
increase. In the past, few people looked for marriage partners
among the citizens of other provinces.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 7,200 people, or 8.17 per cent of all those
registering for marriage here, married people from other
provinces. But in 1997, the number was more than 14,000, or 16.82
percent of the marriage registrations.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that more people are marrying foreigners,
overseas Chinese, or residents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
And, the numbers are growing: from about 800 couples a year a
decade ago to more than 3,000 couples in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Another change has been an increase in the uncontested divorce
rate. More than 11,000 couples in Shanghai got uncontested
divorces last year, compared with only 5,100 couples in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Lineker Joins Hoddle Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Former England international
Gary Lineker has joined in the criticism of Glenn Hoddle for
making public the reaction of Paul Gascoigne's reaction to being
dropped from France 98.
</P>
<P>
In his new book, Hoddle revealed that Gascoigne had gone
"berserk" after being told he would not play for England in the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Lineker said he had never liked players being condemned by
managers in public.
</P>
<P>
"It is slightly bizarre. I don't think it serves any purpose
and cannot see what benefits you get out of the situation," he
told BBC Radio 5 Live.
</P>
<P>
"Players do not want to read about what they have perhaps said
to a manager in a confined situation or a private situation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite amazed that Glenn has been so frank about it, al
most too honest in many ways," said Lineker, now a BBC television
sport presenter.
</P>
<P>
"He just didn't need to mention some of the things he did.
It's not as though he is leaving the job, he is still the
incumbent. It's slightly bizarre."
</P>
<P>
But there was support for the England coach from his agent
Dennis Roach, who pointed out: "Bobby Robson did a diary
immediately after the World Cup, Terry Venables has written more
books than Enid Blyton."

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Local hero Brian Holm headed
countryman Frank Hoy to win the third leg of the Tour of Denmark
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Danes had captured two consecutive stage victories
in a race where a native hadn't won in two years.
</P>
<P>
Holm clocked 5 hours 42 seconds to complete the 215 kilometers
from Odder to Svendborg, the race's second longest leg.
</P>
<P>
Holm broke away with Hoy in the last 60 kilometers and stayed
together to cross the finishing line almost simultaneously by
holding each other's hands up.
</P>
<P>
Both Holm and Hoy were more than four minutes ahead of the
pack, but neither had increased his spot into the top 10 in the
overall standings wherein Belgian Marc Streel still led Dane Bo
Hamburger by 41 seconds.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Falls Below 50 U.S. Cent Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand share market
slumped to the three and a half years low and the local dollar
fell through 50 U.S. cents for the second time in 12 years
Thursday as local financial markets grappled with the implications
of a breakup of the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government is formed by the New Zealand
National Party with Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as its leader and
the New Zealand First with Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters as
its leader.
</P>
<P>
The latest political turmoil was triggered by Peters' walkout
of a special cabinet meeting Wednesday night as a decision was
about to be taken to sell the government's shareholding in the
Wellington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The walkout was followed by an exchange of accusation of each
other at the local TV station, pulling the governing coalition
apart.
</P>
<P>
According to The Dominion, a Wellington-based newspaper, the NZ
dollar, which fell a third of a U.S. cent when news of the
coalition chaos hit, drifted lower Thursday and eventually broke
through the U.S. 50 cents barrier to close at 49.95 cents.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand share market has shed four percent in two days,
wiping 1.8 billion NZ dollars (some 900 million U.S. dollars) off
its value, and closed Thursday at its lowest since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the political instability caused by Peters'
walking out on the cabinet came on top of a host of negative
global factors, not least the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign exchange dealers said that the NZ dollar had
fared relatively well in light of the domestic political ructions.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand economists warned of gloomy treasury fiscal
forecast. In the government budget, the Treasury forecast GDP
growth of 2.7 percent and a government surplus of 1.3 billion NZ
dollars (about 650 million U.S. dollars) for the year to March
1999.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted Bankers Trust chief economist David Plank
as saying that there is the possibility that in the year to next
March, economic growth and the government's operating balance
could be negative.
</P>
<P>
"They'll probably have zero to negative growth in the year to
March 1999, and a fiscal surplus below 500 million NZ dollars
(about 250 million U.S. dollars), which could easily turn out to
be negative," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tony Alexander, chief economist of the Bank of New Zealand,
said that previous predictions of an upturn in the second half of
this year were "extremely optimistic".

<HEADLINE> Billiards World Contest Starts in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The best billiards
players of the world have gathered in this capital to take part
in a tournament being held August 12 to 17 in the Gonzalez
Jimenex de Quezada convention center.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by the president of the Colombian
Federation of Billiards, Pedro Gonzalez, at a press conference in
the Tequendama Hotel of Bogota, who added that this is the first
time Colombia organizes a billiards world contest, with the
sponsorship of a local brewery.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was attended also by the president of the
World Billiards Union, Spaniard Jorge Fuster, and the Number One
and Number Two billiard players of the world: Dutch Dick Jaspers,
and Swedish Torbjorn Blomdahl, besides Belgian Raymond Ceulemans,
many times world champion, and better known as "the father of
billiards."
</P>
<P>
According to Gonzalez, of the 76 sportsmen (70 Colombians and
6 from South America, Mexico and the United States) 12 will be
classified to dispute against 20 European players the world
ranking this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fuster, who made a big effort to bring to Colombia the best
players of the world, told Xinhua that for China to advance in
this discipline, it is necessary to prepare the players when they
are 13 or 14 years old in sports schools.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to organize more international
tournaments for the Chinese players to have more opportunities to
play against the Euroepans, the best of the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> German Banks under Pressure to Settle Nazi Gold Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Two German major banks came under
increasing pressure Thursday to settle a 18-billion-U.S. dollar
compensation claim made by Holocaust victims after a compensation
deal was reached with leading Swiss banks on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in New York, two biggest Swiss bank,
Credit Suisse and UBS, agreed to pay 1.25 billion dollars to
settle the dispute over lost assets deposited by Holocaust victims
in Switzerland during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing Holocaust victims and their heirs made
clear Thursday after the deal that they would now concentrate on
similar lawsuits against German banks.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement in New York has not settle the whole issue.
Things are now starting to get going," said lawyer Michael Witti
in the southern German city of Munich.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German news agency DPA, leader of the
Jewish community in Germany, Ignatz Bubis, also hailed the
agreement reached in New York and called for a quick resolution of
the Nazi gold dispute concerning German banks.
</P>
<P>
At issue is a class-action suit launched by Holocaust survivors
in June in New York charging that the two biggest German banks,
the Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, had profited from Holocaust
victims' personal assets like gold teeth fillings, gold jewellery
and coins seized by German Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Holocaust survivors demanded 18 billion U.S. dollars in
compensation from the two German banks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest development on Thursday, the Deutsche
Bank said the legal action against the Swiss banks was not
comparable with that concerning the two German banks.
</P>
<P>
A Dresdner Bank spokesman also noted that a New York court had
still to decide whether it would finally accept the lawsuit
against the German banks.
</P>
<P>
Both German banks have denied any wrongdoings concerning the
Nazi gold dispute, arguing that the gold received by them from
Nazi Germany's central bank had been delivered in the form of
bullions so that its origin was not known.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese researchers
announced Thursday in Nature, the international science journal,
that they have made "very long carbon nanotubes" which are up to 2
millimetre.
</P>
<P>
The same method, which involved passing acetylene in nitrogen
over an iron-silica catalyst, could produce even longer nanotubes,
said the researchers from the Institute of Physics of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that very long nanotubes may be useful in
the probe tips of scanning tunnelling microscopes, field emission
materials and nanotube-reinforced materials.
</P>
<P>
Nanotubes are strands of carbon molecules with unusual
properties. But until now, there has been no way of produce
nanotubes that are more than a fraction of a millimetre long.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia to Restore Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States urged
Russia on Thursday to take immediate actions to restore confidence
and stability in its economy, expressing its confidence in the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical that the Russian government act quickly to
restore confidence in their economy, and that is something we have
communicated with Russian officials," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has a big stake in seeing that
Russia gets their economy moving in the right direction," said
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. have confidence in the Russian leaders. "The
United States and others in the world community have a great deal
of confidence in the reform-minded leaders of the Russian
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. believes that "if everyone works
together, it can be in the best interest not only of the people of
Russia, but the people of the world economy."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed reports about backing for Russia by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if the G7 remains fully engaged in
monitoring both the developments in Russia and in Asia generally,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to comment on whether Russia should
devalue the ruble currency or if a currency board, pegging the
ruble to the dollar, would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is to meet Russian President Boris
Yeltsin early next month. High on the agenda will be Russia's
economic difficulties and arms control.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin will discuss "economic reform, the health
and vibrancy of the Russian economy," said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously will discuss the need for ratifying and moving
ahead with START II, but it's always been foreseen that there is
an arms-control agenda that moves out beyond START II that
includes the kinds of outlines that...could conceivably lead to a
START III agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States was a key player in drawing up a 22.5 billion
U.S. dollars international rescue package for Russia last month
and Treasury Undersecretary David Lipton, a senior Treasury
official, flew to Moscow this week for top-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Lipton had met Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and
officials from the finance ministry and the central bank to
communicate "the sense of urgency we have about the need to
restore both confidence and stability in the Russian economy,"
said McCurry.

UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has said its

rejecting a proposed visit by a U.N. envoy to look into the

Secretary-General Kofi Annan wrote last week to the Myanmar

</P>
<P>
He said: "Given the special nature of the visit, the
Secretary-General has requested that Ambassador Razali Ismail (of
Malaysia), President of the 51st General Assembly, be his special
emissary at this particular time.
</P>
<P>
"The response from the Prime Minister (Gen. Than Shwe) was
polite but he stated that there was no reason for such a rushed
visit and that the dialogue that the Secretary-General and the
Government of Myanmar had maintained since 1994 could continue
when the Foreign Minister of Myanmar is in New York next month for
the General Assembly's general debate.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is disappointed by the response."
</P>

The spokesman was replying to questions about the U.N. attitude
towards the current situation in Myanmar regarding the differences
between the government and the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Cook Unveils Measures on Curbing EC Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Thursday put forward a range of measures designed to curb the
powers of the European Commission (EC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the New Statesman magazine
published Thursday, Cook said that a new European Union (EU) code
should be drawn up to tighten the rules of subsidiarity, the
principle which says some decisions should not be taken
automatically by Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Cook made it clear that such a code could be regarded as "a
working guide to Europe and to the nation state." Such a code
could set out the responsibilities of Europe and those of
individual member states, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook argued that EU headquarters should adopt more general
European standards of practice rather than impose strict
directives on its members.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment it is a matter of imposed legislation. Much
better if we agree standards at European level, but recognize that
sometimes member states come up with a technical way to meet these
standards which are more appropriate for them," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the British foreign secretary proposed to
establish a new European Forum which would allow for greater
contact between national governments across the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment there is not an adequate basis for
representation fro the national parliaments to come together to
discuss Europe. We must develop some way to link in the
parliaments of the member states," he added.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office official told reporters that Britain
is expected to table these proposals at the special EU summit due
to be held in Vienna, Austria, in October.

<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission,
arrived in central China's Hubei Province this morning amid high
temperatures to inspect the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
He extended his best wishes and highest regards to all those
fighting on the anti-flood front, amd pointed out that continuing
and concerted efforts, as well as strong belief, will surely bring
final victory over the flood.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee with Jiang at the core has shown
great concern about the severe flooding along the Yangtze River
and other watersheds which has been occurring since mid-June, and
has asked many times about the flood situations, and issued
several major decisions in the effort.
</P>
<P>
On the night of August 7, as the country's flood situation came
to the crucial point, Jiang presided over a Standing Committee
meeting of the CPC Central Committee, and made important
decisions.
</P>
<P>
At 10 am this morning, shortly after his plane landed, Jiang
went directly to the 300-kilometer-long Jingjiang Embankment,
which is thought to be the most dangerous of the Yangtze dikes,
having remained waterlogged for more than a month. However, tens
of thousands of civilians and soldiers have secured the embankment
despite one flood crest after another.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang witnessed the fifth raging Yangtze flood crest
which was passing Shashi at the time. The peak was measured at
44.83 meters with a flow rate of 49,500 cubic meters per second,
the largest this year. He felt a bit relieved when he learned that
the Guanyinji, the weakest point of the embankment, had been
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Jiang hurried to Honghu, whose
135-kilometer-long embankment is the weakest section of the
Jingjiang embankment. Jiang called out to the flood-fighters that
a great victory has been achieved so far to protect the Yangtze
embankments and major cities, but vigilance is all the more
important at a time when the floodwaters are beginning to recede.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the People's Liberation Army, and said he
hopes the 130,000 soldiers participating in flood control along
the Yangtze River will continue their efforts and stick to the end.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was accompanied by Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, who is also
head of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters,
Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang Wannian,
and Zeng Qinghong, director of the General Office of the CPC
Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Diplomats Safe: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi stated on Thursday that the missing
Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan are sound and safe.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the evening daily Kayhan, Mohammadi said
that the Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz assured Iran the
missing Iranian diplomats are sound and safe and would be
transferred from Bamian, northern Afghanistan to Islamabad,
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the Iranian diplomats would be handed over
to the Iranian officials in Pakistan in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman did not mention how the Iranian
diplomats reached Bamian.
</P>
<P>
Aziz announced on Wednesday that the missing Iranian diplomats
left Mazar-e-Sharif along with the forces of the Afghan opposition
Northern Alliance to Bamian. He informed his Iranian counterpart
Kamal Kharrazi of the issue Thursday morning when Kharrazi was in
Azerbaijan for a visit.
</P>
<P>
Iran earlier announced that the Afghan fundamentalist Taliban
forces captured 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of the
official news agency IRNA residing in Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday
when they took control of the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban stated that they did not hold any Iranian
diplomats and the Iranian consulate general in Mazar-e-Sharif had
been evacuated when their forces reached.
</P>
<P>
Tehran argued available evidence proved that the Iranian
diplomats and reporter were in the hands of the Taliban and were
transferred to Qandahar, the group's headquarters in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has condemned the Taliban for violating international
laws and norms and held Pakistan, the Taliban's main supporter,
responsible for the safety and release of the Iranian diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Management Training Necessary: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Disaster management courses are
needed to avoid bomb attacks similar to the ones which claimed
more than 200 lives in Kenya and Tanzania last Friday, a Zimbabwe
National Army (ZNA) administrative officer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Sibusiso Moyo told 30 officers, who completed a
month-long disaster management course, that the lack of skills had
resulted in some people remaining buried in the debris in Kenya,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A huge blast which rippled through Kenya Capital Nairobi
Friday was followed soon after by another in the Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
A total of 247 people were killed while more than 4,000 were
injured in Nairobi alone.
</P>
<P>
"Disasters come without warning and often require speedy action
to tackle," said Moyo.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we are saying it is important that we put such a
plan in place," he added.
</P>
<P>
The course was designed to equip armymen with skills to handle
drought, famine and civil unrest disasters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The training, dubbed the Flintlock Two Operations, is part of the
annual joint cooperation between the U.S. army and ZNA.

<HEADLINE> Pak Hopeful to Overcome Temporary Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
has expressed the confidence that with a three-pronged strategy,
the Pakistani government will overcome the current provisional
economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Hafiz Pasha, adviser to the prime minister on finance and
economic affairs, said during an interview Thursday evening with
the Pakistan TV that the government has first of all announced a
comprehensive package of measures aimed at boosting exports,
restricting imports and increasing the inflow of remittances
particularly through banking channels.
</P>
<P>
Domestically, Pasha said, the government is trying to
concentrate on improving the balance of payments position.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the government has also been working to get
support from the Islamic world and it has already been able to put
into place an oil facility with the help of the Saudi government
and has also received medium-term assistance from the Kuwaiti
government.
</P>
<P>
Pasha said that currently the government is working with the
Islamic Development Bank on enhanced trade-financing and
establishment of the Pakistan Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to Pasha, Pakistan has also started a process of
dialogue with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other
international institutions after the withdrawal of objections by
the United States and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF has come back and resumed its dialogue with us and we
are trying to put together a program with the support of the fund
also," Pasha added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that with these three measures combined,
Pakistan will be able to overcome the temporary difficulties
resulting from the sanctions imposed on it by some countries after
its nuclear tests in May.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Confident in Overcoming Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko Thursday said there have been no financial causes for
the current crisis on the Russian financial market and it has been
caused by psychological reasons.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing in the government building, Kiriyenko
said the Central Bank's currency reserve is larger now than it was
in July, when the situation was more complicated and the budget
for August is well-balanced.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the government will respond to the panic
with strict implementation of the stabilization program by the
government.
</P>
<P>
In Kiriyenko's opinion, the current panic on the Russian market
has been caused by external factors, first of all by a fall of
world oil prices and a crisis on the Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
He promised that back arrears for July will be paid in August
and that wages for the current month will be fully paid. The debt
will also be serviced adequately, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Russian blue chip stocks
dived 15-25 percent in the first two hours of trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Trading was suspended on the RTS, the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange, and the Moscow Stock Exchange on recommendations by the
Federal Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
Head of investment at General Securities Mechislav Sheshelovsky
said the Federal Securityies Commission's orders to halt trading
are on target.
</P>
<P>
The crisis on the interbank loan market triggered foreign
investors to close limits for their Russian partners.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has imposed limitations on currency volumes
brought by traders, prohibiting banks to acquire currency in
excess of the clients' bids and introducing a "supply against
payment" principle in interbank operations.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax quoted Central Bank spokesman Irina Yasina as
saying that beginning Thursday, the Central Bank will deal with
commercial banks on the interbank market on the basis of the
"supply against payment" principle.
</P>
<P>
Until now the Central Bank has dealt with banks without
depositing rubles, thus assuming the risk of non-supplies. The
introduction of a new procedure is expected to remove this risk,
Yasina said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Find Embassy Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Thursday condemned terrorist bomb attacks at U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania and vowed to find the bombers and bring them to
justice.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for
these evil acts and see that justice is done," Clinton said at the
ceremony marking the return of remains of Americans who were
killed in the Kenya embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held at Andrews Air Force Base, near
Washington, where 10 of 12 American victims of the Kenya embassy
bombing were brought back by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States will not retreat from the world
because of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Albright, echoing the president, said the United States would
"continue to be present around the world, wherever we have
interests to defend."
</P>
<P>
"We will do all we can to protect our diplomatic and military
peoples around the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met with his top aides Wednesday in the White House to
assess the situation following the twin bombings at U.S. embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, which have killed more than 250 people and
injured over 5,000, most of them Kenyans and Tanzanians. Twelve
Americans were killed in the Kenya embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
Clinton ordered an assessment of what it would cost to rebuild
the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the price tag for
emergency response teams sent to the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also asked for a "list of the priorities for improving
security for U.S. facilities around the world."
</P>
<P>
The State Department and the Office of Management and Budget
will jointly make the assessments "in the next few days," and the
president will present the report to Congress for more emergency
funding.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Peace Process Makes No Headway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Angolan peace talks continued
Thursday with no breakthrough made on some key issues left
unsettled since the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government and the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) found their views quite
apart from each other in such issues like the full disarmament of
UNITA, the re-establishement of government institutions in four
major cities in central Angola, and the re-location of UNITA
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
UNITA suggested days ago to postpone to October the date of
the re-establishment of government institutions in four cities of
Bailundo, Andulo, Nharea and Mungo.
</P>
<P>
The government warned, however, that if UNITA fails to disarm
its army, refuses to re-establish government institutions in the
four cities and move its headquarters to Luanda by the end of the
month, the government would drive UNITA representatives out of
the reconciliation government.
</P>
<P>
The peace conference, resumed on August 7 under the mediation
of UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, was held when the country's
peace process fell in one of the worst crises in four years.

<P>
HARARE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of State
responsible for state enterprises and indigenization, Cephas
Msipa Thursday has challenged youths to take the lead in
employment creation and contribute towards alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said the older generation had fought for political freedom
and the struggle to economically empower the marginalized
indigenous people should now be led by youths.
</P>
<P>
He was opening a one-day workshop organized by the Zimbabwe
Youth in Business (ZYB) to discuss the role of youths in the
indigenization of the economy, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, was confident that youths could play
a greater role in the indigenization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"As we hand over the baton to you, we expect you to accept
your full responsibility in participating in the economic
development of our country with zeal, vigor, dignity and
patriotism," Msipa said.
</P>
<P>
President of the ZYB Bernard Jiro said it was time the
government seriously considered involving youths in matters of
national policy, particularly economic issues.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization supported the government's land
redistribution program and urged the state to give land to graduates
from the country's agriculture colleges.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was attended by about 50 participants from banks,
government, non-governmental organizations and black economic
empowerment lobby groups.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Develops Master Plan for Drug Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has developed a master
plan for decisive control of drug abuse, the official News Agency
of Nigeria (NAN) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the master plan, developed with assistance
from the United Nations International Drug Abuse Control Program
(UNDCP), will be released before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Shariq Bin Raza, representative of the UNDCP in
Nigeria, as saying that the master plan "aims to primarily
coordinate efforts to tackle drug problems through the
participation of the government, the non-governmental
organizations and the general public."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official regretted that drug control efforts in
Nigeria had been compounded by lack of assistance from external
donors owing to the political situation in Nigeria, its size,
population and the prevailing socio-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He, however, expressed the confidence that with political will
and commitment, enhanced awareness, better planning with
appropriate institutions, structures and legislations put in
place, Nigeria will be able to rid of drug abuse.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Volatile after Russian Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A crash on the Russian stock
market, which was fueled by a call of international financier
George Soros for a devaluation of the rouble, added to the gloom
in European markets, resulting in highly volatile trade Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 Index in London slumped to 5,399.5, its lowest
finish since late January, losing 62.7 points or 1.15 percent, as
traders bailed out of key stocks.
</P>
<P>
The plunge initially came after an appalling session in Hong
Kong, but losses increased after news of trading being temporarily
halted on the Russian market in the wake of a 15 percent plunge.
</P>
<P>
A better-than-expected performance on Wall Street pulled
European markets out of their slump, with the Dow Industrials down
about 0.3 percent as European bourses closed.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares staged a recovery from session lows as the
Dow recorded a mixed start, with the Xetra Dax closing 31.91
points or 0.59 percent lower at 5355.03. Despite an afternoon
rally, traders said the worsening situation in Russia continued to
prompt investors to swap into bond markets.
</P>
<P>
French shares in Paris rallied by close as Wall Street managed
to hold off a big reversal on its opening. The CAC-40 closed 5.99
points or 0.15 percent higher on the day at 3951.69. However,
traders said sentiment was clouded by fears of currency
devaluation in Asia and Russian market meltdown.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian stocks were the worst performing in Europe, falling
1.77 percent to 14-month lows amid rising domestic interest rates
and worries about oil prices.
</P>
<P>
However, reports of a special meeting of the Group of Seven
industrialized nations to discuss the Russian financial crisis
brought an added degree of nervousness to the mix, according to
market analysts.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Large Number of Housing Units in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Disputing the government's
defense of its expansion of Jewish settlements, the Israeli peace
group Peace Now revealed in a survey Thursday that a large number
of housing units in settlements are vacant.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now survey showed that at least 2,880 housing units
in the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of West
Bank and Gaza Strip are vacant.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting
the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still
5,892 new housing units now under construction in various
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the
Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the population growth rate at the Jewish
settlements is only 3.2 percent, while the housing construction is
increasing at a rate of 15 percent despite the oversupply of
housing.
</P>
<P>
These results refuted the Likud government's claim that the
construction of new housing units in settlements is necessitated
by rising housing demand caused by the natural growth of the
population of settlers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. government issued a similar report on the
housing situation in the settlements which also showed that a
large number of units were vacant. Israeli government strongly
denied the report, saying that the settlements faced a housing
shortage due to the growth of their population.
</P>
<P>
The Peace Now survey was conducted by 20 teams that it sent to
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to inspect the housing
situation there.
</P>
<P>
Photographer Yoav Leff of Israel's newspaper Ha'aretz, hired by
the Peace Now to document the activities of the Peace Now, was
attacked and slightly injured Wednesday by a group of settlers in
the Itamar settlement near the West Bank city Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Israel has built 190 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip since it captured them from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Settlement expansion is one of the most sensitive disputes in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled since
March 1997 when Israel broke ground for the Har Homa settlement in
the disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The previous Labor government in Israel froze the settlement
expansion in order to conduct peace talks with the Palestinians,
but the right-wing Likud government immediately revoked the ban
after it came to power in mid-1996.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Attains 95 Percent of Revenue Target in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Finance Minister
Sufian Ahmed announced Thursday that his government has collected
6.7 billion Birr (about 957 million U.S. Dollars) from tax and
non-tax revenues in 1997/98 budget year, 95 percent of the
original target of seven billion Birr (about one billion U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Such performance is quite satisfactory at a time when
agriculture, the sector which the country's economy is dependent
upon, has been affected by the El-Nino weather phenomenon, the
Ethiopian News Agency quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's 1997/98 budget year ended on July 7, 1998. The
nation harvested 8.78 million tons of crop in 1997/98, a 16
percent decrease compared with that in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that efforts were also made to minimize
regular expense with a view to balancing government revenue and
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has managed to save money for capital
expenses, development and investment, Ahmed said, adding that the
tendency of depending on foreign aid and loan to cover capital
and recurrent budget has declined.
</P>
<P>
Yet, budget deficit is expected and the deficit could be
offset through loans and aids, the minister was quoted by the
report as saying.

<HEADLINE> "Green" Energy Could Generate Half UK Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Renewable energy could generate
half Britain's electricity by 2025, according to a government
study leaked to the New Scientist magazine.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, to be published Saturday, said that an internal
briefing by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) predicted
power from the Sun, wind, waves and biomass could rise from 3.2
terawatt hours in 1997 to 180 terawatt hours in 2025.
</P>
<P>
Britain's total electricity consumption last year was 345
terawatt (345 billion kilowatt) hours.
</P>
<P>
"The prediction is the most optimistic yet from any (UK)
government on the future of Britain's `green' energy," said New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said the briefing was given last month by the
DTI's head of renewables, Godfrey Bevan, to the department's
14-member Energy Advisory Panel.
</P>
<P>
The briefing outlined the preliminary conclusions of the
British government's review of policy on "green energy," which is
to be published in the autumn, New Scientist said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Water Reserves Decrease Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' water reserves in dams
are rapidly decreasing with fears that many of them will be empty
by the end of the year, if there is no rainfall.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Water Development Department
Thursday, a total of 26,900,000 cubic meters of water remain in
the island's dams, or just 10 percent of their total capacity.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of water in the dams for last year's
corresponding period was 44,100,000 cubic meters of water,
representing 16.4 percent of the total capacity.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Water Development Department, Christos
Markoulis, said Thursday, however, that the recent heatwave which
plagued Cyprus, did not actually contribute to the low-level water
reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said the heatwave did not last long therefore it did not
result in great evaporation of the water reserves.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and
Environment, Costas Themistocleous, announced a number of measures
to tackle the water shortage, including the introduction of mobile
desalination plants.
</P>
<P>
He said 1999 would be one of the most difficult years because
water supplies would run out completely by the end of this year
and the second desalination plant would not be ready.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has one desalination plant in Dhekelia on the
southeastern coast. A second one is expected to be completed
after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the last time Cyprus dams had reached
tragic levels was during the year 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
However, heavy rainfall during December 1991 virtually saved
the island after a flow of 40 million cubic meters of water into
the dams.

<HEADLINE> Britain Withdraws From Military Satellite Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain would pull out of a
tri-national military project to develop a new generation of
satellite, according to a report in Thurday's Financial Times
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Britain signed up to the joint military venture with France and
Germany last December, hailing it as a flagship example of how
European Union member states could work together on big defense
projects.
</P>
<P>
However, British Minister of State for Defense Procurement Lord
Gilbert said Wednesday that Britain would withdraw from the
project because it was incapable of delivering a satellite in time
for Britiain's deadline of about 2005.
</P>
<P>
Lord Gilbert noted that Britain would now concentrate on "a
national solution" to its military satellite needs following its
decision to quit the 1.62-billion-dollar Trimilsatcom project.
</P>
<P>
"We remain strong supporters of collaboration in the field of
equipment procurement and a decision not to pursue a major program
like this is not taken lightly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain's French and German counterparts reacted
with anger, terming Britain's actions as "without precedent." The
two countries are expected to hold talks to decide whether to
proceed with a bilateral venture.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Fighting Terrorism Is Duty of Whole World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOD MILITARY AIRPORT, ISRAEL, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said here Thursday that fighting
terrorism is not only the responsibility of Israel and the
U.S., but the duty of the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the statement at a welcome ceremony held for the
Israeli team sent to Kenya's capital Nairobi to join the rescue
efforts after the terror bombing against the U.S. Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
He praised the outsanding operation of the team in Nairobi,
saying it showed the Israel Defense Forces could fight all kinds of
terrorism in the world.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he was proud to point out that the performance
of the Israeli rescue team in Nairobi has enhanced Israel's
international prestige.
</P>
<P>
He added that the team's hard work has set an example for all
in the army as well as the whole country.
</P>
<P>
At least 250 people have been killed and 5,000 others injured
in the two powerful bombings against the U.S. embassies in Nairobi
and Tazania's capital Dar es Salaam last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 150-strong Israeli rescue team was sent to Nairobi only six
hours after the bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel, a country that has repeatedly targeted by terrorist
bombings, has boasted sophisticated technologies and expertise to
carry out rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli rescue team, from the army's Home Command, was
equipped with specially designed equipment, including heavy-duty
balloons, pneumatic jacks and cutters capable of lifting and
cutting through iron, cement and other hard objects.
</P>
<P>
During the whole rescue operation which ended Wednesday, the
Israeli team pulled out 95 dead bodies and rescued three people
trapped alive from the debris.

ADDIS ABABA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A high-level delegation
from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) met Rwandan
officials in Kigali Thursday for political settlement in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, according to a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador M. Bah, head of the OAU mission and special

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Israel will soon pick up the once-stalled
discussions on an Israeli intention to build an 80 million dollars
worth of bromine plant in the kingdom, the semi-official Jordan
Times Thursday quoted Roey Gilad, spokesman of the Israeli Embassy
in Jordan, as saying.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, Jordan dropped out of the negotiations with
Israel's Dead Sea Bromine (DSB) Group and reached an accord with a
United States company to establish such a plant.
</P>
<P>
The DSB Group said that the Jordanian-U.S. project was
"economically illogical" and intended to snatch back the contract
or get the permission to establish another bromine plant in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Israel has agreed to "greatly" reduce customs duties
on Jordanian commodities such as air-conditioning units,
televisions and ceramics to be exported to Israel and the West
Bank areas, Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a meeting between Jordanian
Minister of Trade, Commerce and Supply Hani Mulqi and his Israeli
counterpart Natan Sharansky Wednesday in Tel Aviv, the report said.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon has signed a contract worth 8.2 million
U.S. dollars with a Canadian company to computerize and upgrade
the country's land registration system.
</P>
<P>
The deal with the Canadian firm CRC Sogema is part of the
ongoing efforts to modernize Lebanon's administration which was
wrecked during the 1975-1990 civil war and improve its
performance, the Daily Star newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the deal will make possible the
automatic registration of property sales and allow foreigners to
verify the legality of their property purchases within minutes.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Peace Process in Deep Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Thursday that the peace process is in deep crisis due
to Israel's refusal to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in Gaza city upon his return from South
Africa, the Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said no progress has been made so far in the
Palestinian-Israeli talks, which were resumed last month, because
of Israel's rejection to all initiatives to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed his call for an urgent Arab summit to face the
hazards caused by Israel's settlement expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader has been for months pressing for an Arab
summit, which has not been materialized due to the differences
among Arab nations over the agenda, venue and timing.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Arafat also urged the convention of an
international conference initiated by France and Egypt to seek
ways to save the long-stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, who accompanied
Arafat on the visit to South Africa, said that the Palestinian
side would not accept any Israeli idea which is outside of the
framework of the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
No contacts were arranged in the past few days on whether to
continue the direct talks on Israel's troop redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the U.S., the leading broker in the Mideast
peace process, the Palestinians and Israelis resumed direct talks
on July 19 to discuss the U.S. initiative on the Israeli pullback.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made so far because Israel attempted
to revise the U.S. plan which calls for a 13.1 percent Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed to hand back 10 percent of the West Bank while
keeping the other 3 percent as "nature reserve", in which the
Palestinians are not allowed to build houses.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Arafat's three-day visit to South Africa, Erekat
said the Palestinian diplomatic efforts are intended to let the
international community know Israel's intransigence and to seek
international help in reactivating the peace process.

<HEADLINE> UK's Oxford to Launch English "Dictionary of the </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Oxford University Press
will launch what is billed "the most important English dictionary
for a century," which contains over 2,000 new words such as
Blairite, alcopop and tamagotchi.
</P>
<P>
The New Oxford Dictionary of English has taken 30 editors and
60 worldwide consultants six years to compile, for the the Oxford
University Press started from scratch to redefine every word in
the English language and its contemporary meaning.
</P>
<P>
The new dictionary contains 350,000 words, with fewer meanings
for individual words than previous dictionaries. That is because,
using new psychological theories on how human brains use language,
the dictionary identifies a small number of core meanings for each
word.
</P>
<P>
Also, the dictionary gives advice on political correctness
concerning the usage of words. For example, how the use of black,
white or person of color is acceptable, but not spinster, squaw
and harelip.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary is the first written from scratch by the Oxford
University Press in more than 70 years and was compiled using the
latest computer technology to analyze how the meaning of words has
changed.
</P>
<P>
Oxford University Press spokeswoman Helen McManners said, "We
started compiling it six years ago. It was an absolutely
monumental task," according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Using written English in novels, reference books, magazines,
newspapers and transcripts of the spoken word a `corpus evidence'
was created so every word in the language could be analyzed for
its different meanings.
</P>
<P>
Each time a word occurs, it was fed into a database along with
a `tag' defining its meaning in that context so when a
lexicographer defined it, they could call up the ways it is used
in the corpus evidence.
</P>
<P>
"What this means is that 20 years worth of reading can be
scanned in seconds to see exactly how that word is used and what
it means," she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The dictionary team drew on the British National Corpus,
containing 100 million words, the 40 million-word American Corpus,
the 44 million-word Oxford Historical Corpus, and 43 million words
of citations collected by the Oxford World Reading program.

<HEADLINE> Lott Urges Clinton to Cooperate on Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Republican Leader
Trent Lott has said the Senate may not consider health care
quality legislation this year unless President Bill Clinton
encourages cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Your veto threat only makes our job harder," Lott said in a
letter to the White House released by the Republican leader's
office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering Monday in Louisville, Kentucky, Clinton
said that he will veto Republican legislation to regulate health
plans, because it offers less security from abuses than his
administration's "patient's bill of rights."
</P>
<P>
The president also told Americans to consider the partisan
disagreement over health care when they vote in congressional
elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
Lott responded with a letter dated Tuesday, saying "we believe
the American people want a change in law, not a campaign issue."
</P>
<P>
Lott asked for a public statement from Clinton "that indicates
your willingness to work with us, not against us."
</P>
<P>
"Without your cooperation, we fear that we may not be able to
consider health care quality legislation this fall," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a followup letter Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle said Senate Democrats will support Clinton in a veto
fight.
</P>
<P>
"If patients' rights are not adequately protected, or if 113
million Americans are excluded from the protections, Congress will
have no right to claim that it has passed meaningful HMO (Health
Maintenance Organization) reform," Daschle wrote. "My Democratic
colleagues and I stand firmly behind your decision to veto such
legislation if it reaches your desk."
</P>

The House has passed health care legislation crafted by
Republican leaders.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Urging Palestinians to Accept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government Thursday
denied it had urged the Palestinians to accept an Israeli proposal
of troops withdrawal from West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The denial came in a government statement issued in response to
a non-official Al Quds newspaper report which said Jordan had
advised the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to accept the
Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were resumed three weeks
ago, the first time in 16 months, but only to come to a stalemate
again.
</P>
<P>
The talks centered on a peace proposal put forward by the
United States, which calls for Israel to evacuate from 13.1
percent of the occupied Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have already accepted the proposal. Israel
rejected it and suggested instead a 10 percent handover of the
West Bank together with limited Palestinian rule over a further 3
percent, which was designed as a "nature reserve."
</P>
<P>
Turning down Al Quds' report as baseless, the statement said it
did not conform with Jordan's stand on the PNA, which is in firm
support of the Palestinians' pursuit to restore their national
rights on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
"We have explained our position on this issue on many
occasions and at all levels and our position is fully identical
with that of the Palestinian brothers," it added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been keeping a close watch on the developments of
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, for its national security
interests are at stake.
</P>
<P>
Jordan supports the Palestinians to establish an independent
state with its capital in Jerusalem, while it sticks to a policy
of normalizing ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now Israel's closest ally in the Arab world. It is
one of the two Arab countries that have singed peace treaty with
Israel. The other is Egypt.

UNITED NATIONS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations Thursday expressed its grave concern over the
continuing escalation of fighting in Afghanistan caused by the
Taleban forces' offensive in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the council was briefed on the
latest developments in Afghanistan, current Security Council
President and Slovenia's Ambassador to the United Nations Danilo
Turk said the council members also expressed their concern over
the grave humanitarian crisis in the country which has been
deepened further as a result of the recent offensive by the
Taleban.
</P>
<P>
The council called on all parties concerned in the country to
respect the humanitarian law and human rights as well as the
access of international humanitarian aid to the people in need.
</P>
<P>
The council members condemned the complete disregard by the
Taleban towards the will of the international community and in
particular the presidential statement by the Security Council on
August 6 which remanded an urgent and unconditional cease-fire
leading to the final ending of the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was deeply concerned at the reports of the
capture by the Taleban of the consul general of Iran and called it
a violation of international law, and urged the immediate release
of the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The council was deeply concerned over the persistent reports of
outside military involvement in the country and called on all
states concerned to refrain from any outside interference in the
internal affairs of Afghanistan, including the involvement of
military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its position that there is no military
solution to the Afghan conflict and demanded an end to bloodshed
and resumption of peaceful dialogue under the auspices of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The military forces Taleban last month launched offensives in
the northern part of the country. Reports say the Taleban has

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Says He Has Confidence in Troubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- In an apparent attempt to quell a
surging call for the cabinet's resignation in Jordan, King Hussein
said Thursday that he still has confidence in Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hussein made the remarks in his reply to Majali, who sent
congratulations to the king Tuesday on his 46 years on the throne.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who is in the U.S. for cancer treatment, said he had
"trust and pride" in Majali and all the policies he had adopted.
</P>
<P>
Following a potable water pollution scandal in Amman last
month, the opposition political parties are strongly demanding the
resignation of the whole cabinet for their failure in settling a
string of domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
Residents in western Amman early last month complained that
water flowing out of their taps has an odor and contains worms and
larvae.
</P>
<P>
Water and Irrigation Minister Munther Haddadin resigned last
Wednesday, but Majali has ruled out the possibility of the
resignation of the whole government, saying that any option lay
only in the hand of the king.
</P>
<P>
The Majali government, which was appointed by Hussein in March,
adopted a reform package aimed at developing Jordan's economy
through measures such as privatization, alleviating poverty and
unemployment, and supervising parliamentary elections. But all the
plans have suffered setbacks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia to Restore Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States urged
Russia on Thursday to take immediate actions to restore confidence
and stability in its economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is critical that the Russian government act quickly to
restore confidence in their economy, and that is something we have
communicated with Russian officials," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has a big stake in seeing that
Russia gets their economy moving in the right direction," said
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed reports about backing for Russia by the
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if the G7 remains fully engaged in
monitoring both the developments in Russia and in Asia generally,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to comment on whether Russia should
devalue the ruble currency or if a currency board, pegging the
ruble to the dollar, would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The United States was a key player in drawing up a 22.5 billion
U.S. dollars international rescue package for Russia last month
and Treasury Undersecretary David Lipton, a senior Treasury
official, flew to Moscow this week for top-level talks.
</P>
<P>
Lipton had met Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and
officials from the finance ministry and the central bank to
communicate "the sense of urgency we have about the need to
restore both confidence and stability in the Russian economy,"
said McCurry.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Supreme Court, as
the constitutional court of Mozambique, Thursday declared as
valid the municipal elections held on June 30 in 33 cities and
towns around the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the election law of Mozambique, the Supreme Court
plays the role of the constitutional court if the later is
absent.
</P>
<P>
Reading the verdict, President of the Supreme Court Mario
Mangaze pointed out that the judges agreed to the validity of the
elections, overruling the opposition concerns about the official
results.
</P>
<P>
Mangaze said that the votes in the 33 electoral zones had all
been rightfully checked and correctly counted.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the supreme court had not found any
rigging in the process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the high rate of abstention from voting, Mangaze
said that it had nothing to do with the validity of the election
results.
</P>
<P>
Five of the seven judges of the Mozambican Supreme Court have
signed on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that among the 1.965 million voters in the 33
cities and towns, 1.678 million abstained.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition party Mozambican National Resistance
(Renamo) and other 15 opposition parties boycotted the local
elections.

They claimed that the results of the voting were invalid on
the ground that the abstention rate mounted up to 85.42 percent.

supreme court would lose the trust of the people if it declared
the elections valid.

<HEADLINE> Second Bomb Threat at Swazi U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States Embassy
in Swaziland was working aggressively on a method to trace hoax
bomb threats, after it received the second threat Thursday in
three days.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller telephoned the embassy in Mbabane at about
2:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT) and told a secretary that a bomb had been
planted in the building and was due to go off at any time.
</P>
<P>
The seven-story Swazi Central Bank building, in which the U.S.
mission occupies the top floor office, was immediately evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off all access roads and diverted traffic.
</P>
<P>
Bomb disposal experts were called to the building again and
they used sniffer dogs to search all seven floors and the
adjoining car parks but no bomb was discovered.
</P>
<P>
The embassy received a similar bomb threat from an anonymous
caller Tuesday morning, causing a similar security operation by
police.
</P>
<P>
The embassy spokesman Thursday appeared unconcerned about the
incident, which he said was just another hoax by "silly callers"
exploiting the present situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the embassy was working aggressively on a method by
which such callers could be immediately traced and apprehended.
</P>
<P>
Last week massive bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania killed more than 200 people and injured over 5,000.
Twelve Americans were among the dead in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Swaziland Alan MacKee said Tuesday that
hoax bomb threats were to be expected in the wake of these
bombings, but all threats had to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
MacKee said security had been stepped up at the Mbabane
embassy, its staff houses and the embassy's separate cultural
center and library.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there was hoax bomb threat in the Hilton
Hotel in Kenyan capital Nairobi Thursday, but no explosion
occurred.

A loan agreement has also been reached with the African
Development Bank for the purchase of 50,000 tons of fertilizers
for the coming three years.

cooperation" of authorities in Kenya and Tanzania, calling the
relationship "superb."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief's Envoy Says Dialog With Iraq Will </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Prakash Shah,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy in Iraq, said on
Thursday following his meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz that dialog with Iraq would continue.
</P>
<P>
Shah told a news conference on Thursday evening that his
meeting with Aziz started at eight o'clock p.m. and lasted an
hour and a quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Shah said he conveyed to Aziz a message
from Annan "which is primarily along the lines of the statement
the U.N. Secretary-General made to the Security Council on the 6th
of August."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government announced on August 5 suspension of
cooperation with UNSCOM (the U.N. Special Commission for
disarmament in Iraq) and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
complaining that UNSCOM is pro-U.S. and attempting to prolong
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shah said he told Aziz that "there is a unanimous view in the
Security Council that Iraq should continue cooperation with the
United Nations and UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
"It was this message that the secretary-general also wanted to
reinforce that the Security Council's resolutions on this matter
is quite clear, and Iraq's obligation to comply with them has been
reaffirmed in the memorandum of understanding which the
secretary-general signed with Iraq on February 23," said Shah.
</P>
<P>
Shah said Aziz wanted to convey "the Iraqi point of view, the
Iraqi concerns, the Iraqi apprehensions."
</P>
<P>
"Dialog will continue between the U.N. secretary-general's
representative and Iraqi authorities," Shah said "that is the
best description I can give at this moment," adding that Aziz
promised he would bring the message of the secretary-general to
the notice of Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
Shah said he and Aziz discussed a number of things, but he
refused to go into details, saying he would report to the
secretary-general first.
</P>
<P>
Shah said he would stay in Iraq "as long as it is
necessary for the Iraqi authorities to continue this dialog,"
but he refused to predict what would happen if Iraq failed
to resume cooperation with UNSCOM.
