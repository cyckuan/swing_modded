   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories _ Sidewalk pennants that
proclaim Yellowknife the ``Diamond Capital of North America'' help
explain why Canadians are working to ensure that their baubles are
not confused with the ``blood diamonds'' of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clean, upfront business,'' Stephen Kakfwi, the
provincial premier, said in an interview, throwing diplomatic
subtleties to the Arctic winds. ``You don't have to go through the
jungles of Angola or Sierra Leone, dealing with guerrillas and
dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   In the largest industrial project above North America's tree
line, Ekati Mine opened almost 200 miles northeast of here two
years ago and now produces about $1.3 million worth of diamonds a
day, or 5 percent of the world production. When two other mines
start producing nearby, by 2005, the Northwest Territories is
expected to produce as much as 15 percent of the world's diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The only large producer in the Americas, Canada will then join
the ranks of the world's top diamond producers, which include
Botswana, Russia, South Africa and Angola. With this future
glittering on the horizon, like a mineral aurora borealis, Canadian
officials are acting to protect the future image of diamonds, in
contrast to the trafficking in uncut stones that helps to pay for
guerrilla armies in Sierra Leone and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do otherwise would be to court commercial catastrophe,''
Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, Robert Fowler, told the
World Diamond Congress, an industry group, in a speech in Belgium
last month. ``In Canada in the 1970s, we watched our fur industry
_the business upon which our country was founded _destroyed by a
small number of very shrill and very effective animal rights
activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Indian families have yet to recover income lost when
consumer resistance to fur coats wiped out in a few years a
tradition of commercial trapping that dated back to the 1700s, and
a potential consumer backlash against diamonds strikes fear in the
Northwest Territories, a vast wilderness larger than Texas and
California combined, but with a population of only 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kakfwi, the premier, who is a member of the Dene tribe,
estimated that the portion of his people making a living from
trapping has plunged, to five percent today, from 65 percent a
quarter century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Irving, the territorial director of diamond projects,
said, ``We have been through it with fur, and we don't want to go
through it with diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``If the issues with conflict diamonds don't get
solved, the consumer is not going to be able to differentiate
between the different kinds of diamonds, and is going to be against
diamonds, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are developing a technology
that would ``fingerprint'' diamonds, identifying them by trace
impurities that could be tracked to known mines.
</P>
<P>
   To promote Canada's Arctic diamonds, the Territorial government
now provides certificates to show that the diamonds were mined and
cut in the Northwest Territories. One cutting and polishing company
working here, Sirius Diamonds, now etches with a laser a tiny polar
bear on each diamond. Other Canadian cutters use as their brands a
maple leaf and a snow goose.
</P>
<P>
   And Canadians are actively involved in the crackdown on diamonds
from war-torn areas. Fowler chairs a U.N. committee that is
investigating violations of an embargo on the purchase of diamonds
from Angolan rebels. Ralph Hazleton, a Canadian diamond expert,
recently testified at the United Nations about Liberia and Burkina
Faso buying diamonds from Sierra Leone guerrillas in violation of a
second embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to images of war associated with West African
diamonds, Irving said that Canadian marketers want to associate
Arctic diamonds ``with images of the north _ ice, clean, pristine,
crystal clear.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To provide jobs, the Territorial government has insisted that
diamond mines market at least 10 percent of their raw diamonds
locally.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Sirius and two other cutting and polishing
companies have opened here, with the cutting skills largely coming
from Antwerp, Belgium. In future years, billions of dollars of
diamond mining investments are expected. Today, mining projects are
underway for only 12 out of the Territory's estimated 325
kimberlite pipes, the funnel shaped veins of diamond-bearing rock
associated with ancient volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   From London, De Beers Consolidated Mines, the company that
controls about two thirds of the world trade in uncut diamonds, is
suddenly focusing its investing telescope on this laid back
frontier town of 18,000 people. Since late June, De Beers has
invested in one company prospecting for diamonds in the Northwest
Territories, and has begun a hostile takeover bid for a second
company that is about four years from production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be an international diamond center, a place where
Israelis, where people from New York will come to secure their
diamonds,'' said Kakfwi. That will be a stretch for a territory
whose sole air links are daily flights to Edmonton, Alberta.

COLLAPSE OF CAMP DAVID TALKS DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE KILLED PEACE
PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS Arafat's age in 6th graf; SUBS 3rd graf after optional trim
with updating)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Less than three weeks after the Camp David push for
a final Middle East peace settlement ended without agreement,
perhaps the most promising development, by the reckoning of many on
both sides, is what has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   Despite dire warnings of bloodshed were the talks to collapse,
there has been almost no violence. Apart from minor clashes,
Israelis and Palestinians have gone peacefully about their lives.
Coordination between Israeli army and police commanders and the
security chiefs for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority,
unthinkable only a few years ago, has helped to keep things
tranquil. In fact, the Palestinian security forces have won high
praise from Israeli military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the warnings that the Arab world would unite to
stiffen Arafat's resolve not to budge on his claim to Jerusalem.
Instead, a whirlwind tour of his traditional backers among Arabs
and Europeans has left Arafat with almost unanimous advice to keep
talking.
</P>
<P>
   When Arafat set out on his tour, the assumption was that he was
hoping for a common front in backing his refusal to compromise at
Camp David. But as his itinerary has lengthened, some diplomats
have come to suspect that the Palestinian leader is taking
soundings on whether the Palestinians' traditional backers,
especially Arab countries, might accept a compromise over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to back off, and I don't say that he will, he's
going to need cover,'' one Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, 71, traveled Friday to Moscow, one of more than a dozen
capitals on his itinerary, and encountered also there a reluctance
to see the peace process founder over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   According to news agency reports from Moscow, the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, urged further negotiations with Israel,
and advised Arafat not to take ``unilateral decisions,'' the code
for Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinian state on Sept. 13 on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it extremely important to continue the negotiations,
and to reach a peace agreement,'' Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign
minister, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important were upbeat comments from Arafat. ``We must
complete this peace process, no matter what difficulties we
encounter on our way, for the sake of our children, the children of
our children, for our future,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Egypt, where Arafat met with President Hosni Mubarak on
Wednesday, there were also signs of flexibility. Mubarak's chief
political adviser, Osama Baz, suggested a readiness for compromise
when he said on Thursday that Egypt would not dictate to the
Palestinians on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role is not to deliver the Palestinians, and not to exert
pressure on them,'' Baz said. ``On the other hand, our role is not
to tell them to harden and not accept what is offered. Our role is
to encourage.''
</P>
<P>
   From Moscow, Arafat flew to Finland, and then to Norway, where
he was scheduled to meet Friday with Shimon Peres of Israel. But
reports from Oslo said Arafat had arrived later than expected,
forcing the cancellation of their meeting. Reports from Oslo said
Arafat had arrived later than expected, forcing the cancellation of
a formal dinner and putting the talks with Peres in question.
</P>
<P>
   Although he now holds a relatively junior Cabinet post, minister
for regional cooperation, and was unexpectedly defeated in a
contest for the Israeli presidency last week, the 77-year-old Peres
had arrived in Oslo saying he hoped to discuss possible future
courses for a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials continued to sound optimistic. Shlomo Ben-Ami,
Israel's new foreign minister, said in Barcelona that negotiations
with the Palestinians were continuing with the purpose of closing
``everything that needs to be closed'' and setting up a ``short and
decisive summit.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.S. mediator in the Middle East, Dennis Ross, was due
in the region next week for a round of meetings.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there were also voices of discord. In talks with
Iran's leaders in Tehran on Thursday, Arafat was told to hold firm
on Jerusalem. The visit assumed special significance because Iran
is the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, a grouping of about 50 Muslim states.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Muslim can allow holy Jerusalem to remain under occupation,
and the Organization of the Islamic Conference will never let any
deal be made over Jerusalem,'' the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal
Karrazi, told Arafat, according to news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Saudi Arabia suggested that the Saudis, who claim a
special authority on matters like Jerusalem because of their
guardianship of the two holiest sites in Islam, Mecca and Medina,
have also opposed any compromise on Jerusalem. But several Arab
states in the Persian Gulf, under pressure from the United States,
have shied away from any all-or-nothing statements on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats believe Arafat may find new negotiations hard to
resist even without an Israeli compromise on East Jerusalem. In
this view, Arafat, who is 71 years old, may find it difficult to
slam the door conclusively on proposals put forward by President
Clinton that would give the Palestinians, apart from Jerusalem, a
settlement that only a few years ago would have seemed chimerical _
including Palestinian sovereignty over much of the West Bank,
Israeli acceptance of Palestinian statehood, and a Western aid fund
that could run into billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Even the proposals for Jerusalem could be hard to reject if
Arafat were to conclude that a majority of Palestinians, and
traditional backers like Russia and Egypt, would back, or at least
not oppose, their acceptance.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Will Clinton steal show from Gore?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By DAVID IVANOVICH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the nation's first couple, President Clinton
and his wife, Hillary, have turned heads for eight years, upstaging
just about everybody in their path.
</P>
<P>
   But as the two arrived here Friday in advance of the Democratic
National Convention, critics warned that the Clintons' star power
threatened to steal the attention, confuse the message and even
lure the campaign dollars away from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to raise millions of dollars in cash for both the Clinton
presidential library and Mrs. Clinton's New York senatorial race,
the Clintons will rub shoulders tonight with Hollywood luminaries
ranging from Cher to Gregory Peck in tony Brentwood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they are slated to attend a brunch hosted by
entertainment diva Barbra Streisand, the New York Times and other
news outlets have reported. The brunch, however, does not appear on
the president's official schedule, and White House officials
professed no knowledge of the event.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, Hillary appeared on NBC's Tonight Show with
Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are demonstrating their well-known fondness for
Hollywood, political analysts say, at a time when Gore appears to
be trying to distance himself from the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's vice-presidential running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., has long been a critic of Hollywood mores, while Gore's
wife, Tipper, took on the entertainment industry back in the 1980s
with a campaign to get record companies to warn parents about their
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Clintons are luring away money that might come
to the Gore campaign's coffers, while confusing the Democrats'
message just days before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, these two are the very personification of
selfishness,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia. ``They have three concerns: me, myself and
I.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Black, a professor of American politics at Rice University,
agreed the Clintons appear to be ``using this as an opportunity to
pursue their particular interests ... rather than letting Gore take
advantage of the opportunities that are presented by his
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, speaking aboard Air Force
One en route to Los Angeles Friday, tried to downplay talk of
competition between the Clinton and Gore camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a natural shift after the convention by you guys (the
news media) _ not necessarily by us _ that moves to the
candidates,'' Lockhart said. ``We're sensitive to that, but there
(are) still things that we are going to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, both Mrs. Clinton and the president will speak at the
convention. And then on Tuesday, Clinton and Gore will meet in
Michigan for what campaign organizers are calling a ``symbolic
passing of the baton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane shrugged off suggestions that
Clinton was making it harder for Gore to take full advantage of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is always in the spotlight. The president is
going to say what he is going to say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sabato argues that in the Gore camp ``they must be seething. I
suspect many of the Gore team will turn out at the airport to wish
them a fond farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, of course, are in unique circumstances. Mrs.
Clinton is the first first lady to seek public office on her own as
her husband was vacating the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton did try to deflect criticism of Gore in the wake of
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, telling a group of religious leaders
on Thursday: ``Surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for
any mistake that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all political analysts were so critical of the Clintons'
behavior here in Los Angeles. Thomas Mann of the Brookings
Institution, a Washington-based think-tank, noted that Clinton has
been a sure-fire fund-raiser for Democrats during his time in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Tuesday, Mann noted, ``the convention will be about
Gore and the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no shortage of attention to Al Gore,'' Mann
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle reporter Bennett Roth contributed to this story.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    EgyptAir crash still a mystery
 &HT;    Co-pilot was accused of sexual misconduct
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By MICHAEL HEDGES
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 last October
officially remained a mystery Friday as federal officials released
FBI findings that a co-pilot initially suspected of forcing the
plane into a suicidal plunge had been investigated for sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, head of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said FBI reports that co-pilot Gamil El-Batouty had been under
investigation by New York hotel security officers for allegedly
exposing himself and making unwanted sexual advances were being
made public because they ``may be relevant to our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Batouty is heard uttering a religious phrase in Arabic
repeatedly as the plane, carrying 217 people, made its fatal plunge
into the Atlantic off Nantucket early last Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of what was recorded in the cockpit during the last
minutes of the flight was also released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Capt. Adel Anwar had excused himself to go to the
restroom, El-Batouty is heard saying, ``I rely on God.'' He
repeated that phrase at least 10 times before the plane crashed, a
minute and 58 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   As the co-pilot repeated that mantra, thumps and clicks were
heard on the recorder, then four beeps from a cockpit warning
device. The precise cause of the thumps has not been determined,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Just 32 seconds before the recording abruptly ended, the pilot
returned and asked: ``What's happening? What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   El-Batouty continued to say, ``I rely on God,'' and pilot Anwar
shouted ``What's happening, Gamil? What's happening? What is this?
What is this? Did you shut the engine? Get away in the engines.
Shut the engines.''
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot responded: ``It's shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the last sequence on the tape, the pilot urged: ``Pull.
Pull with me. Pull with me. Pull with me.'' That is followed by
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the crash, U.S. investigators said privately that
they suspected El-Batouty had forced the Boeing 767 into its doomed
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Hall took pains Friday to say that the NTSB had reached no final
conclusion about what led to the destruction of Flight 990. ``I
want to make it perfectly clear that no determination as to the
cause of this crash has been made,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs that U.S. officials have ruled out
mechanical failure. Hall said there would be no public hearing on
the disaster, which is mandatory if safety issues remain. Hall said
the board has concluded ``there are no unresolved safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall told Congress earlier this year that the way the plane
reacted during its plunge was consistent with a ``deliberate action
on the part of one of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the crash, the NTSB had released information from the
flight data recorder that showed the plane's engines had been
turned off, as well as its autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a bitter divide remains between Egyptian official opinion
that the crash was most likely caused by an aircraft failure, and
the American view that no evidence has been found to support
mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Hall said no further safety issues remained, Mohsen El
Missiry, an Egyptian official aiding the probe, said there would be
an additional investigation into ``the design of the Boeing 767's
elevator system.'' The plane's elevators, small wings on the tail,
point the nose up or down.
</P>
<P>
   And EgyptAir issued a news release saying the 1,660 pages of
analysis released by the NTSB on Friday actually supported a theory
of failure by the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing on the cockpit voice recorder or the flight
data recorder to indicate Flight 990 was intentionally crashed into
the ocean,'' said Capt. Shaker Kelada, an EgyptAir official who
took part in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelada dismissed the reports of sexual misconduct by El-Batouty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful examination of FBI interviews indicates the relief
first officer's behavior in a New York hotel is largely
unsubstantiated,'' he said. He called those reports a ``smoke
screen,'' and said El-Batouty had no personal, professional,
medical or financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   EL Missiry said speculation about the co-pilot's behavior,
fueled by the FBI reports released Friday, ``is painful for the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI interviews of employees of the Pennsylvania Hotel in New
York where the EgyptAir crew frequently stayed documented a number
of alleged problems with the 59-year-old El-Batouty, including a
charge that he offered to pay a hotel maid for sex the night before
the crash. That was just the last in a long series of incidents at
the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A hotel employee told the FBI that El-Batouty had been warned
that his behavior would be reported to his employer, EgyptAir. It
was not clear whether the hotel followed through with that threat.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the NTSB would publish a probable cause of the crash
in a final report. He said there was no timetable for the release
of that report.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which carried 100 Americans, 89 Egyptians, 21
Canadians and seven others, left New York for Cairo shortly after 1
a.m. It crashed into 250 feet of water about 51 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the remains of 19 victims have been identified, and Hall
said medical examiners were continuing a process of comparing DNA
from family members with the victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an immense tragedy experienced by people around
the world,'' he said.

MOVING HEAVEN AND EARTH FOR THE CITY OF ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (CORRECTS reference to NFL team in 4th graf of 2nd take) 
By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He helped lead the charge to lure the Democratic
National Convention. He helped finish the fund-raising for a grand
new concert hall. He helped recruit the new school superintendent.
He founded one art museum and has plans to vastly expand another,
and to revive a historically anemic downtown. He's the mayor's best
friend, and helped bankroll campaigns to elect a new school board
and pass a new city charter. And, oh, did we mention, he's the
richest man in town, worth more than $5 billion?
</P>
<P>
   Almost every sphere of civic life in Los Angeles these days
bears the fingerprints of one soft-spoken, silver-haired
67-year-old man: Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive of Sun
America Inc., the financial services and investment giant that for
most of the 1990s was the fastest-growing company on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx-born son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who began his
career at 21 as the youngest certified public accountant in
Michigan history, then developed a home-building empire that
stretched from Detroit to Los Angeles, Broad has in the last few
years become his adopted city's ultimate go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats arrive next week, Broad (rhymes with road) will
be front and center to welcome them, though perhaps not as front
and center as he wished. He did not get either the speaking slot at
the convention or the skybox at the Staples Center that he had
asked for. (He will have to share one of three skyboxes with the
local host committee, of which he is a co-chairman and to which he
gave $1 million while helping raise several times that.)
</P>
<P>
   But Broad, and his supporters and critics alike, are quick to
agree that he has flourished in Los Angeles as he could have in few
other cities, if any, where tradition, schools, clubs and old-boy
networks matter more and moxie and money matter less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' Broad said as the afternoon sun filtered
over a broad swath of Beverly Hills outside his office window.
``It's a meritocracy. You can come here without the right family
background, which I don't have, the right religion, the right
political affiliation, and if you're willing to reach out and
really work and spend your time, energy and sometimes your money,
you're accepted. That's not true of most other cities in the world
or North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's one of the reasons I love the city, because it's
allowed me to do all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, who has known him since
they worked on Alan Cranston's campaign for the U.S. Senate more
than 30 years ago, said Broad ``is making a herculean effort to
fill a vacuum'' in Los Angeles' civic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he does something, he does it all out,'' Kantor said.
``Most of the time he succeeds. Sometimes he does not. But the fact
is that some people, whether they are threatened by it or resent
it, are irritated by anyone who pushes that hard and demands
action. He does not sit around and suffer inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican businessman who has
recruited Broad, a lifelong Democrat, to help in innumerable civic
causes, finds a more mischievous way to describe his friend's
bluntness: ``Eli knows nothing about foreplay.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention is a case in point. Broad was among a handful of
people who wanted the chance to show off the city's recovery from
the fires, earthquake, riots and recession of the early 1990s, and
was one of the original co-chairmen of the local host committee,
which pledged to finance the convention by raising more than $35
million and to use city money only for municipal services like
transportation and security.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles got the convention, but ever since has had trouble
raising the promised money. And Broad has complained publicly and
privately that at least one of his fellow co-chairmen, the record
and movie mogul David Geffen, failed to put up any of his own. Andy
Spahn, Geffen's chief political aide, said Geffen had made clear
from the beginning that he would help bring the convention to Los
Angeles but intended to direct his fund-raising and contribution
efforts to the actual electing of Democrats, beginning with Vice
President Al Gore. ``This is a case of no good deed going
unpunished,'' Spahn said.
</P>
<P>
   But bad blood and embarrassing headlines have lingered for
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened?'' Broad said of the controversy. ``I'll tell
you what happened. I got all the press, that's what happened. And
why did I get all the press? I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Every city has a cadre of civic leaders who support the elected
government, raise money for cultural institutions and charitable
causes, and offer private advice to public figures. In the 1950s
and '60s, Los Angeles itself had the Committee of 25, a shadowy
conclave of businessmen who helped pick candidates for appointment
or election to public office and generally set the tone in the city
until the Watts riots set off changes in the municipal power
structure.
</P>
<P>
   But with a shift in the region's economy from large, home-grown
industries like aerospace to multimedia conglomerates, with a wave
of mergers and acquisitions that have left downtown Los Angeles
lacking a headquarters of a single Fortune 500 company, and with
his own considerable ambition, Broad has emerged as a virtual
committee of one, or, as he puts it, a venture philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   That has not always endeared him to some officials and fellow
billionaires here, who complain _ invariably under cloak of
anonymity _ that he is too quick to claim credit, too willing to
hog the spotlight, too wrapped up in his own pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a big ego,'' Broad said matter-of-factly in a recent
interview in his 38th-floor headquarters in a Century City office
tower. ``I like to be thought of well.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Broad is also something of a rarity in an age of handlers
and spin doctors, consultants and retainers. He returns his own
phone calls, often flies commercial and still shows up at the kinds
of business breakfasts and chicken dinners that most moguls eschew.
A few years ago, he used his American Express card to buy a Roy
Lichtenstein at Sotheby's for $2.5 million, because he had
calculated the interest he could earn by delaying the payment for a
month. (He also got 2.5 million frequent-flier miles, most of which
he gave away to a local arts college for student travel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, people are visionaries or doers, but not both,'' said
Riordan, who regularly vacations with Broad on cruises and bike and
ski trips. ``He is both a visionary and an incredible doer, who
gets onto something like a pit bull and won't let go until he gets
it done. To a point that drives you nuts sometimes. On vacation,
you want to avoid him. He spent our last vacation, in Sun Valley,
on four major topics of what the city needed to do. I just wanted
to run the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked a couple of years ago what Broad wanted, one leading
Angeleno, a respected graybeard among the city's power players,
said, ``I think he wants to be the single most influential private
citizen in Los Angeles,'' adding with a chuckle, ``And he's got the
money to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad has not managed to get everything he wants _ his bid to
draw a NFL team to a revamped Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum failed
last year, as did his rivals' _ but it is not for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say that working for him is like working for a
jackhammer, that he is fair but relentless, keeping four aides busy
in his outer office alone. Golf and other leisure activities hold
not the slightest allure; he keeps his perpetual tan by holding
long business meetings or reading papers outdoors. His speech, in
the flat accent of Michigan, is economical, tending to omit
prepositions and definite articles, so that he says, ``I was born
New York City.'' Even his passion, collecting modern art, is a
business, with a curator and a lending foundation.
</P>
<P>
   His impatience is also legendary. A few years ago, irked that
the world-famous architect Frank Gehry was taking too long to
finish his new house in the Brentwood section, Broad hired another
architect, with the result that Gehry disowned the house. (That
feud threatened to derail Broad's later efforts to raise money to
finish the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, which Gehry
also designed, but things were smoothed over.) Just now, on the
site of two former houses in Malibu, Broad is building a
4,000-square-foot beach house designed by Richard Meier, who
designed the new Getty Center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a white Richard Meier house,'' Broad said, ``and I think
white Richard Meier houses look great in beach areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad's current projects, both just beginning, are an expansion
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, on whose board he serves,
with a new wing and pedestrian arcade (an effort to which he will
presumably give millions of dollars), and a public-private
undertaking to revive Grand Avenue, the downtown street that is
already home to the Los Angeles Music Center and the Museum of
Contemporary Art (which Broad helped found 20 years ago) and that
will soon see the completion of the Disney hall and a new cathedral
for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Just talking
about downtown gets him so excited that he pulls out a pad and
starts sketching his vision of a new park, pedestrian-friendly
sidewalks, restaurants and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't own anything downtown,'' Broad said. ``All downtown
does is cost me a lot of money. But every great metropolitan area
needs a core. This city doesn't have any real core. It doesn't have
a place where people from different communities can come for free
concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some elected officials have complained that Broad involves
himself in matters, like selecting a new school superintendent,
that are none of his business. But he professes pride in such
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think I'm doing what's right,'' he said, ``I think at the
end of the day people will appreciate it and I'll feel good about
it. And along the way I'm not looking for votes.''

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Lenny Krayzelburg's keenest competition eyed him
like a hawk on Friday. It was an intimidating presence, what with a
wingspan that stretched practically from one wall of the IUPUI
Natatorium to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg could see his most onerous opponent down the stretch
of the 100-meter backstroke final at the U.S. Olympic Swimming
Trials without even having to crane his neck much. It was
!ital!right there the entire second lap.
</P>
<P>
   On this night the USC graduate's most austere adversary won. The
clock beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg was .24 seconds slower than the world record he set
last August in the pool where the Sydney Olympics will take place
next month. Though visibly disappointed, Krayzelburg couldn't
really complain.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he realized his dream: He made the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   And with plenty of room to spare. The race offered a stark
reminder of how far behind Krayzelburg has left the rest of the
best in the U.S., only the clock remaining to push him.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Walker is the 100 short course meters world-record holder,
but he couldn't offer Krayzelburg a concerted challenge for more
than 50 meters. Walker was Krayzelburg's nearest nemesis and he
finished 1.01 seconds behind Krayzelburg's 53.84.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen-year-old Aaron Peirsol handed Krayzelburg his first
defeat in two years at a low-key meet at USC last month but
couldn't come within 1.3 seconds of him when the pressure was a
hammer pounding on his temples.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Bridgewater won the 200 backstroke at the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, but sometime between then and now he became more mentor
than measuring stick. Krayzelburg beat his Trojan Swim Club
teammate by 1.98 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tate Blahnik has won a national title in the backstroke and he
finished 1.97 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   The difference? Walker, Peirsol, Bridgewater and Blahnik were in
the event; Krayzelburg is of it.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Mark Schubert noticed Krayzelburg's otherworldly gift
almost immediately after Santa Monica College coach Stu Blomkin _
who also saw something really special _ delivered Krayzelburg to
him in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they started working together, Schubert took the
Fairfax High graduate aside. Krayzelburg, whose family emigrated to
the U.S. from Odessa, Ukraine, in 1989, remembers the ensuing
conversation as if it were yesterday: ``He said, `Lenny, I think
you could be the best backstroker in the world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old smiled. ``I think that really stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   His world records in the 100 and 200 tell the story of a
prophesy fulfilled. Not that Krayzelburg will admit to it. Getting
him to brag on himself is harder than beating him in the pool. His
parents reared him to have a small ego and big dreams and he is
nothing if not a dutiful son.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats were smart, they'd collect Krayzelburg, who
became a U.S. citizen in 1995, at LAX when he arrives home next
week and make him the centerpiece of a famil-values platform.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg and Yelena Krayzelburg imbued him with an incorruptible
work ethic. They spawned him in 1975 and they sustain him now.
They're his inspiration and his entourage; Oleg is his son's sports
psychologist and cook and Yelena his protector.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Krayzelburg minces few words. ``My dad's advice to me
is always `Break world records,' '' Krayzelburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Right after he touched the wall and saw his time, Krayzelburg's
eyes moved to the stands, to where his parents were standing.
Predictably, he saw Oleg, his arms outstretched, mouthing the
words, ``What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Before he could mouth a reply, he saw his mother take her
program and swat her husband on the shoulders and head. Krayzelburg
didn't have to be a lip reader to know she was saying, ``What's
wrong with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg laughed as he finished describing this Kodak moment.
There is nothing wrong in his world. Nothing at all.

ANALYSIS: PONDERING THE IMPACT OF BUCHANAN AND NADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS to MasterCard in 17th graf) 
By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The five-party system of Democrats, Republicans,
Greens and two Reform parties is something new in American
politics, and right now it is helping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
in important ways.
</P>
<P>
   The fracture in the Reform Party has dampened whatever slim
hopes the ex-Republican Pat Buchanan had for weakening Bush from
his right. And the energetic campaign by the Green Party's Ralph
Nader, at least for the moment, is helping Bush maintain his lead
over Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the election is not right now, and the fluctuations
in the polls reinforce the impression that it is far from the minds
of most Americans, even those who state a preference. And Buchanan
and Nader have a potential for hurting Bush, too _ Buchanan with
social conservatives and Nader with diehard campaign reform voters,
the old John McCain crowd. But not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last fall, when Buchanan's romancing of the Reform
Party seemed to threaten Bush? Well, his need to reinvent himself
as an authentic Reform Party man distanced him from his core
anti-abortion, anti-homosexual, anti-immigrant base. And even
though Buchanan tried to return to his first love Thursday with a
statement of social value principles, Bush has used the last 10
months to fill the conservatives' dance card, and stir their dreams
of Supreme Court justices who will reverse Roe v. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The impending weeks or months of dispute over who gets the
Reform Party's $12.6 million in federal funds _ even if Buchanan
ultimately prevails over his rival, John Hagelin _ mean that he
will be handicapped in using the money strategically. Lots of
important television time, after all, has already been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Nader, ranging between 5 and 9 points in national
polls and thus plainly able to tip some battleground states like
Michigan, Washington Wisconsin and maybe California to Bush by
draining support from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Nader and his backers say that is not their purpose.
And Gore and his backers say that won't be his effect, eventually.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore folks are whistling past the graveyard. The threat
to Gore is the real meaning of the Nader campaign. Right now there
is no question that two-thirds or more of Nader's backers, in state
after state, are coming out of the vice president's potential
voters. And some Gore backers outside his campaign itself admit the
problem. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., for example, wrote in an Op-Ed
piece in Thursday's New York Times that ``A vote for Mr. Nader is a
vote for Mr. Bush and environmentalists who join his personal
crusade risk marginalizing the conservation movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader takes on that argument on two fronts. First, he says he is
running to win, which is about as realistic as General Motors'
defense of the Corvair when Nader attacked it as unsafe in 1965.
Second, he says that while Gore might be a teeny bit better than
Bush on the environment and a couple of other things, the
differences are too small to matter.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars of third parties argue that such candidacies always
fade. John Anderson went from 15 percent to 6 percent in 1980.
Henry Wallace declined similarly in 1948. And even Ross Perot, the
eccentric billionaire who founded the Reform Party in 1992, dropped
from about a third of the vote in polls to 19 percent on election
days, and after spending $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   John Bibby, a retired political scientist at the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee and a student of third parties, said: ``Nader
looks like he could do respectably now. My guess is his vote would
go down as you get closer to the election. The closer the election,
the more significant is the wasted vote argument.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When it comes down to it, you want your vote to be
meaningful.'' A Gore strategist agreed. He said: ``I don't see
Nader being like Perot in being able to communicate. He won't spend
$56 million.'' And he argued, ``As people get to know Gore better,
I think it's going to make it a lot easier to see him as someone
who fights for people and will be on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Republican strategist was unconvinced, arguing that Nader
would hold on to enough support to be a factor. ``He has a
long-standing reputation among a core group of voters he doesn't
need ads to purchase,'' the strategist said.'' He added that
because of his consumer record, Nader ``gets a little bit of an
earned media ride, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, and Buchanan, too, also argue that their differences from
the Republicans and Democrats are enabling them to make voters out
of non-voters. Nader sometimes argues that even if Gore loses, the
Green Party's missionary efforts will help elect more Democrats to
the House, and make Rep. Dick Gephardt speaker.
</P>
<P>
   That's what third party candidates always say. Curtis Gans, head
of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate and a
student of voter turnout, said he saw only ``a slight chance that
Nader will stir some increase among young people,'' and no
indication that he was bringing in other potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Patterson, head of a Harvard study of ``the Vanishing
Voter'' that uses weekly polling to learn what is behind low
participation, said he saw no evidence that either Nader or
Buchanan ``really seems to be popping'' and exciting voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is another target for Nader _ the Perot voter who reacted
in 1992 to Perot's criticism of the way campaign cash and lobbying
fees dictate results in Washington. This week Nader started showing
a television commercial (with an authentic old politics touch, his
staff refused to say where the modest purchase of advertising time
was taking place or how much was spent). It parodied recent ads for
MasterCard with lines like ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser:
$1,000 a plate'' and ``Finding out the truth: priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   But clever as that ad is, the Nader campaign says it plans to
spend no more than $5 million on commercials for the entire 2000
campaign. While ads for which little time was bought, like the
Willie Horton ad to promote Bush's father in 1988, have sometimes
become effective by being shown often on news programs, there is no
indication that will happen with Nader's commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The only real money available for the outsider candidates is the
$12.6 million for the Reform Party. Even if Buchanan gets it, the
Bush campaign dismisses him as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said ``The sun has set on Pat
Buchanan's candidacy and will not rise again. Pat Buchanan is old
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Federal Election Commission can speed up its
normal pace and get a check in the mail before the 2004 campaign,
Buchanan could be at least an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Maisel, co-author with Bibby of the 1998 book ``Two
Parties or More,'' said he thought if Buchanan spent his money
wisely, in a few small states with big anti-abortion movements, he
might still matter. The Colby College professor of government said
Nader might fade faster. He said, ``I think there is more
ideological zealotry on the part of the anti-abortion people than
there is on the part of labor and the environmentalists.''

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As the latest twist in a political
convention filled with them, Pat Buchanan on Friday shattered the
emerging image of the Reform Party as a haven for white
conservatives by selecting as his running mate a black woman who
taught public school for years in South Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the larger of the party's feuding factions
nominated Buchanan as its presidential nominee. With the smaller
group nominating John Hagelin, the fight over $12.6 million in
federal campaign funds was officially enjoined, to be fought out
over the next few weeks before the Federal Election Commission and,
in all likelihood, a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's pick of Ezola Foster, whose hard-right views
virtually mirror his own, made her the first black candidate to
seek the vice presidency for what is, arguably, a major party.
(There have been other black candidates for president, including
Shirley Chisholm, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, who
sought the Democratic nomination in 1972.)
</P>
<P>
   In presenting Foster at a midday rally, where almost no one knew
who she was until he introduced her, Buchanan gave no indication
that the ticket would face further obstacles, legal or otherwise,
on the march toward the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this lady will be a tremendous benefit to our cause,
to our campaign and to our movement,'' he said, standing beside
Foster. ``She'll be an ambassador to America for what this party is
all about. This shows that we are a party that is open to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who has brought new energy to the Reform Party since
Ross Perot's second unsuccessful campaign for president in 1996,
had closely guarded the identity of his pick since the convention
began on Thursday. But even with all the speculation over who it
might be, the rumored names never included Foster. This is a
convention, after all, in which the vast majority of delegates are
white, and most are men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Foster, 62, a former Democrat and a former Republican who
followed Buchanan into the Reform Party when he left the
Republicans last year, has been known to Buchanan for years.
</P>
<P>
   A public school teacher and administrator for 33 years and a
twice-failed candidate for the California Assembly, she is founder
of a California-based organization called Americans for Family
Values. She was an ardent supporter of Proposition 187, a 1984
California measure that sought to deny aid to illegal immigrants,
before courts struck it down. She favors local control of public
schools and opposes programs in them that promote safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Buchanan named her as a co-chairwoman of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At her introduction, Foster discounted any role that race might
play in her candidacy, insisting: ``We want to do what's right for
all Americans. We have to stop appeasing one group after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she seemed an unlikely choice for Buchanan, whose views
are so far to the right on many issues that he has especially
strong appeal to fringe groups that include white supremacists,
militia members and anti-Semites.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, who serves as chief campaign strategist for her
brother, said Foster emerged as the vice-presidential choice over
several others was because she shared Pat Buchanan's views on most
issues and because ``she could hold her own in debates.''
</P>
<P>
   As for any votes and support the ticket might lose because the
vice-presidential candidate is a black woman, Bay Buchanan said,
``If we lose them, then I say goodbye. I'm not interested in them,
and I hope this pick tells them we are not interested in their
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's selection was also well received by many Buchanan
supporters, who went out of their way to say they did not mind that
she was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so excited for her, and I'm from Alabama,'' said Sharman
Ramsey, whose husband, Joel, is a delegate from Dothan, Ala.
``We're not prejudiced against blacks. We want competent,
responsible people of any color.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Moore, a Florida delegate said: ``Her selection lends us
more credibility. It puts to bed a lot of the spin about us being a
party of whites, because we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's moment of triumph as a nominee came after delegates
in the faction supporting him voted almost unanimously to throw out
a monthlong primary in which hundreds of thousands had
participated. That vote is being replace in favor of a vote by
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in three presidential campaigns that the
will of ordinary voters, whom Perot had envisioned as holding the
ultimate power, was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But the move was widely viewed as a way to protect Buchanan
against legal action by Hagelin, who has accused the Buchanan
campaign of election fraud. In a complaint to the Federal Election
Commission filed on Thursday, the Hagelin campaign charged that
Buchanan's supporters sent primary ballots to as many as 500,000
people who were ineligible to vote in the Reform primary.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the primary were not disclosed to the larger
group. They were to the smaller. But even though Buchanan won
49,529 to 28,539, in voting totals that represented just 10 percent
of the ballots distributed, the pro-Hagelin group also voted to
throw out Buchanan's votes as fraudulent and named Hagelin by
acclamation its presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the nomination, Hagelin called on the feuding
factions and all independent parties to unite as an alternative to
Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of all we cherish has come from third-party
voices,'' Hagelin said. ``This is a powerful, powerful movement. We
should begin the process of healing and rebuilding, putting aside
the small ideas that divide us and replace them with grand ideas
that unite us.''

BRUINS SUFFER LOSSES LONG BEFORE OPENER

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ UCLA, which considered depth one of its strengths
this season, won't be quite as deep when it begins fall practice
today.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins head coach Bob Toledo announced the suspension Friday of
three reserves and also said backup cornerback Julius Williams had
flunked out of school and oft-injured defensive back Lovell Houston
has decided to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers Santi Hall and Asi Faoa were suspended for the
season-opener against No. 3-ranked Alabama for violating team
policy, Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa is facing a pre-trial hearing Sept. 18 on felony charges of
mayhem and assault for his alleged role in an off-campus fight this
year. The case, in which Faoa has pleaded not guilty, is not
expected to go to trial until after the season. Toledo would not
elaborate on Hall's suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Also suspended was third-string defensive tackle Saia
Makakaufaki, who will miss two games for academic reasons, Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions of Hall and Faoa could be significant in that it
robs the Bruins of their No. 2 and No. 3 strong-side linebackers
against Alabama. True freshman Brandon Chillar will likely back up
starter Tony White.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who recently decided to undergo reconstructive surgery
on his right shoulder, decided he wanted to be closer to his family
in Denver while he rehabilitates, Toledo said. Houston's younger
brother Marcus is a running back at the University of Colorado. &QL;

NEW YORK REVOKES MEDICAL LICENSE OF FERTILITY SPECIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Department of Health Friday
suspended the medical license of a well-known fertility specialist
with a busy celebrity-favored practice who is facing retrial on
insurance fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   The state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia Novello, deciding the
doctor posed ``an imminent danger to public health,'' suspended the
license of Dr. Niels Lauersen before a state investigative
committee had finished reviewing the complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   Health department officials said they took the action against
Lauersen, who was already on probation with the state for previous
infractions, because of the nature of the charges against him, and
because he appeared confused and incoherent during several days of
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the department's investiga- tion details numerous
charges of negli- gence, incompetence, fraudulent practices and
moral unfitness involving seven pa- tients. One charge involved a
delivery that left a baby severely brain-damaged; an- other told of
a patient on whom an unneces- sary hysterectomy had been performed.
Lauersen is among the busiest gynecologists in the state, despite a
spate of malpractice lawsuits and government investigations, as an
increasing number of couples seek solutions to their fertility
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen has attracted a following of patients as he moved from
hospital to hospital. While most specialists tend to be discreet
about their celebrity patients, he has bragged about his _ Celine
Dion, Liv Ullmann and Geraldo Rivera's former wife, Kiki.
</P>
<P>
   Novello has increasingly employed what was once a fairly rare
practice _ forbidding doctors to practice medicine while an
investigation is under way. She has suspended the licenses of 31
doctors so far this year, 19 more than in all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lauersen's lawyer, Robert Deutsch, denounced the
health department for the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The denial of a fair hearing, I believe, is merely a
continuation of the department's vendetta against my doctor since
1995,'' he said, alluding to the year in which the state began
investigating Lauersen. Deutsch attributed Lauersen's apparent
incoherence to fatigue brought on by the department's requirement
that most of his hearing occur during 10 consecutive days, with
each session lasting 12 hours. ``This has never before been done in
the history of the department,'' Deutsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to let this drop here,'' Deutsch said. ``We
are trying to stay the enforcement of this order.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen's receptionist said Friday that the doctor would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Lauersen dismissed the state's previous
investigation as minor, and said he did not know what the state
agency ``really is.'' He also denied that he was currently under
investigation. ``The important thing is that I am careful in
everything I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen is well known among New York City obstetricians and
gynecologists. In part, this is because of his practice involves
fertility work for patients he then refers to obstetricians. Some
contend part of his notoriety stems from his standards of care
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he pushes the envelope on standards of practice,''
a former colleague said. ``But his patients adored him. He has a
huge following.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen is the author of several books on fertility and
gynecological health. But he attracted national attention this
spring, when he was prosecuted by the federal government for a
scheme in which he billed insurance companies for gynecological
cases that actually involved fertility procedures. The case ended
with a hung jury and will be retried this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lauersen had previously been placed on probation for two years
by the state as a result of an earlier investigation into his
medical competence. The state ruled that his practice should be
monitored by his hospital employers, and that he had to take a
course in medical record keeping.

ERRORS, BAD INNING DOOM DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientists talked about raising the Titanic but found
it wasn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should try a test run on the Los Angeles Dodgers'
season, and if they can salvage that, they can move on to the
Titanic. It's debatable which would be a bigger undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to erase memories of a horrid homestand and trying to add
some semblance of order to a season quickly sinking, the Dodgers
bullpen allowed five runs in the bottom of the eighth inning in a
7-2 loss to Atlanta on Friday at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The swirl created by the season quickly vanishing down the drain
also threatens to take manager Davey Johnson with it. His future
with the organization continues to look bleak, especially since the
Dodgers have lost two straight, five of six and are 5 games behind
San Francisco in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, it's not a good feeling,'' Dodgers second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek said. ``We need to try and bounce back (today)
and try to win a game and see what it feels like, and then maybe
try to win two. There's not a good feeling in here, no question.
We'll see what kind of people we have in here, if we're men or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also trail the Mets by eight games in the wild-card
race, and frustration is prevalent in every corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's getting late in the season and it looks like
we're going backward instead of forward,'' Dodgers all-star left
fielder Gary Sheffield said. ``We played seven good innings of
baseball and let it slip away. I could never figure this situation
out. A lot of things happened this year that you would never think
would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration might best be exemplified by perhaps the worst
offensive game of the season for Sheffield. He was 0 for 4 with
four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game Johnson expressed his frustration with the
club's lack of execution during critical stretches, and he got
another painful chance to witness it against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Tied 2-2 in the bottom of the eighth, the Dodgers _ particularly
third baseman Adrian Beltre _ again didn't make the pivotal plays.
</P>
<P>
   After Chan Ho Park pitched a strong seven innings, Terry Adams
relieved and got Andruw Jones to hit a chopper toward third. But
rather than charge the ball and short-hop it, Beltre tried to field
it on a middle hop and it got away and into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the balls you have to come in and play the short
hop,'' Johnson said. ``If you knock it down, you can pick it up and
throw him out. If you back up on it, you're going to get a nasty
short hop. He's young. He'll learn.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ruled a basehit, but it was the springboard for a
five-run inning. Worse, it wasn't the only gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones doubled in Jones, Wally Joyner singled in a run to
make it 4-2. It could have stayed there when Adams (4-4) got Javy
Lopez to ground to Beltre with runners on second and third and one
out. But as Beltre went to take the ball out of his glove to throw
home, he dropped the ball. Beltre got Brian Jordan wandering off
second base, but a chance to get pinch-runner George Lombard at the
plate was wiped away.
</P>
<P>
   Adams had been brilliant for a nine-game stretch until this
outing. He had allowed one earned run in his last 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell behind a couple guys and got a couple of ground balls I
thought should have been made, but when you fall behind and have to
throw it over, you get hit,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a month and a half left. We need to win
ballgames. That's no secret. We need to get a streak going or we're
going to fall behind because Arizona and the Giants are playing
well.''

STRONG START BY GIANTS WASTED BY LATE FUMBLE
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ In a bizarre ending to a preseason game the
New York Giants had all but won Friday night, the Jacksonville
Jaguars recovered a fumble in the Giants' end zone with seven
seconds remaining to score a touchdown and win, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' reserve cornerback, Fred Lewis, intercepted a pass
from Jonathan Quinn, Jacksonville's third-string quarterback, at
the Giants' goal line and then ran 1 yard into the playing field.
As he did, Giants linebacker Jack Golden tackled Lewis, apparently
trying to keep him from advancing the football.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis fumbled backward, where the Jaguars' Brandon Christenson
recovered the ball for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The freaky conclusion marred for the Giants, 0-2 in the
preseason, what was an otherwise good game for their first-team
offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   For a second consecutive week, the Giants' starters, led by
quarterback Kerry Collins and running back Tiki Barber, moved the
football. The first-team defense delivered another rugged, steady
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The starters _ for a second successive week _ left the field at
halftime with the lead. For a second consecutive week, the reserves
could not hold on.
</P>
<P>
   Collins completed 10 of 19 passes for 110 yards and a touchdown.
Barber had 83 rushing yards in the half. Wide receiver Amani Toomer
caught just two passes, including a 22-yard touchdown pass, but
continued to establish himself as a big-play threat. And the rookie
Ron Dayne, while again looking dependable in short-yardage
situations, also seemed to get stronger as the game unfolded,
finishing with 66 rough-and-tumble rushing yards on 17 carries.
</P>
<P>
   It was Collins, as he had in the Giants' preseason loss to
Chicago, who made the dominant impression with his confidence and
poise. Collins threw the ball accurately and frequently deep down
the field, and his passing statistics don't reflect three dropped
passes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Giants' first possession Collins, throwing off his back
foot after double-pumping, lofted a perfect pass to Toomer, who
made a spinning catch as he fell over the goal line for a 22-yard
touchdown. It was the kind of bold strike rarely attempted by the
Giants in previous seasons _ and even more rarely executed
properly.
</P>
<P>
   It put the Giants ahead, 7-0, a lead they extended to 10-0 on
Brad Daluiso's 27-yard field goal. That drive was set up by a
55-yard dash around right end by Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, the Giants' most consistent offensive weapon last
season, had a couple of dazzling runs in what has been a
spectacular preseason. Lighter and quicker this year, Barber was
stuffed at the line of scrimmage on his long run, but flashed
outside and raced down the sideline, outrunning all but one
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Giants' remade starting offensive line displayed
the same unity apparent in last week's loss to Chicago. Collins,
who was not sacked, was hit in the pocket after passing just once.
The running backs had holes to work with and time to find them
because the Jaguars' defensive line rarely found its way into the
Giants' backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first half, Collins threw an interception when he
tried to force a short pass to Howard Cross over the middle.
Jacksonville linebacker Brant Boyer stepped in front of the pass
and deflected it to his teammate Michael Swift, who made the
interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, led by the reserve quarterback Jamie Martin,
advanced to the Giants' 10-yard line. They were stopped there,
however, by the Giants' first-string defense.

ANALYSIS: HOW RELIGION PERMEATES BOTH GOP AND
DEMOCRATIC  CAMPAIGNS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even in America, where piety and politics shack
up in the strangest ways, it was quite a week.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Al Gore, a Southern Baptist, anointed an Orthodox
Jew as his running mate to help attract Christian voters.
</P>
<P>
   And it ended with Bill Clinton bowing before a mega-church
packed with Christian ministers, seeking post-Monica atonement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of Sen. Joe Lieberman brought comparisons to
the 1960 presidential race, when John F. Kennedy's Catholic faith
became a major campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the reaction to Lieberman's candidacy shows how much
the nation's religious and political landscape has changed over the
past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's response to ``the Catholic question'' was to stress
his secularism, to emphasize that his policies would never be
compromised by the proclamations of popes or prelates.
</P>
<P>
   It's the opposite today. In breaking this historic religious
barrier to national political office, Gore did not pick a secular
Jewish running mate nor one who attends a mainstream Reform
movement synagogue. Gore went all the way, choosing a political
partner whose Orthodox faith lies at the center of his being, from
the food he eats to how he spends his Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't choose Lieberman because he's Jewish; he chose him
because the Connecticut centrist is a man of faith. Gore and his
advisers understand that the theological and political fault lines
in America no longer divide us into camps of Christians or Jews,
Catholics or Protestants, Baptists or Methodists.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a post-denominational world, where the commonalities
of faith overshadow sectarian differences.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a world where Presbyterian churches host Passover
seders, where Pope John Paul II travels to Israel and refers to
Jews as ``our elder brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelicals complain about Lieberman's pro-choice position on
abortion, but they embrace him as a Judeo-Christian brother who
believes in God.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are some Americans on the Christian Right fringe who
won't vote for Lieberman because he's a Jew. But the real
battleground in the Bush-Gore race is for Americans in the middle,
those church-going folks an infamous televangelist once called the
``moral majority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Lieberman is Jewish by birth, but more importantly, he is
seen as a man of faith. He is seen as authentic,'' said Rabbi
Robert Wexler, president of the University of Judaism in Los
Angeles. ``For Christians who are religious, he is a validation
that someone who is very religious can hold that office.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his moral failings, Clinton is one Democrat who
understands the political power of post-denominational
``born-again'' piety. Observers may disagree as to the president's
sincerity, but few can question the fact the he used the rhetoric
of redemption to survive the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It was on display once again this week when the Southern Baptist
president was interviewed by Pastor Bill Hybels on the stage of the
Willow Creek Community Church.
</P>
<P>
   Willow Creek is one of the nation's best known
``mega-churches,'' a nondenominational congregation that uses
contemporary worship and modern marketing techniques to attract
16,000 worshipers to weekend services. It eschews denominational
ties and focuses on attracting ``seekers'' and other unchurched
Americans comfortable with a moderate, ``user-friendly''
evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke into a cordless microphone, his image beamed onto
two huge video screens in the cavernous church auditorium. Once
again, the subject was ``his terrible mistake,'' the audience was a
room full of Christian ministers, and the message was redemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``My spiritual life,'' the president confessed, is ``a work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But the strangest event on the politics-and-piety front this
week was neither Lieberman's anointment nor Clinton's confession.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the moral arbiters of political correctness ruled
that Loretta Sanchez, a Latina congresswoman from Orange County,
could not hold a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion  &UR; and &LR;  speak to
the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1976, when Jimmy Carter confessed to Playboy magazine
that he has ``lust in his heart,'' has Hugh Hefner thrust himself
so forcefully into the rough and tumble of presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Carter dropped 15 points in the polls after his infamous Playboy
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to choose between the two venues, Sanchez first said she
would appear at the Hispanic Unity USA fund-raiser at the Playboy
Mansion in Los Angeles. But Friday, after the decision drew a
barrage of criticism, Sanchez said she might be willing to move the
fund-raiser to another venue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the moral of the story is that  &UR; some  &LR; things in American
politics never change. Today's Democrats can embrace an observant
Jew on the ticket and a repentant sinner in the White House, but
they still draw the line at an unrepentant Latina in the House of
Hefner.

COMEBACK COMPLETE FOR MIRACLE MERCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Left-hander Kent Mercker's return to the mound
tonight to start for the Anaheim Angels is nothing short of a
miracle, manager Mike Scioscia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it's a big deal,'' Scioscia said. ``After what
happened, it's miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was stricken with a life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage
while pitching against the Texas Rangers May 11 at Edison Field.
Three months later, he's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying we have a need,'' said Scioscia, whose
starting pitching of late has nearly reached the point that anyone
healthy enough to make it to the mound can take a turn. ``But that
certainly is not the primary reason Kent is starting. We didn't
make the move just because we had a need. Our first concern was his
health. The last thing we were worrying about was if he'd pitch
again this season, next season, any season. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent was very efficient with his pitches in his last rehab
start, well enough to carry into a major-league game. Our thought
is that even if he gives us just four or five innings it still has
to catapult him into a better position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, he'll be in the 85- or 95-pitch range, possibly
100,'' Scioscia added. ``If he's efficient with his pitches,
that'll give us a solid six innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker appeared in 12 games, including two starts, before he
was stricken. He takes an 0-1 record and 5.16 ERA into tonight's
game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Too much stress: After extensive tests, it was discovered
that Angels left-handed starter Jarrod Washburn's sore shoulder is
the result of a stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis Yocum said Washburn can return to the rotation as soon
as the pain subsides but declined to pinpoint a date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say if it'll be a week or three weeks or what,'' he
said. Yocum added that no surgery is indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn came off the disabled list (because of a strained left
biceps) Monday night to start against the Chicago White Sox. He
came out in the sixth inning because of the pain and said
afterward, ``I am definitely worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia welcomed the news, saying, ``At least this is something
that's manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Disabled right-hander Tim Belcher threw in the
bullpen Friday and, according to Scioscia, ``threw extremely
well.'' Belcher is on the DL for the second time this season
because of his right flexor muscle, operated on in December. . . .
Angels reliever Al Levine (tendinitis, right elbow) will likely
come off the DL Tuesday, the first day he's eligible to return.
Closer Troy Percival (tendinitis, right elbow) is another matter.
He hasn't so much as picked up a ball since he was disabled Aug. 5,
Scioscia said. . . . The Yankees placed left-hander Allen Watson on
the 15-day DL because of shoulder pain and recalled left-hander
Randy Choate. It's the third time Watson has made it to the DL this
season.

 BUCHANAN WINS NOMINATION, PICKS BLACK WOMAN FOR NO. 2  &HT;     By JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ Pat Buchanan won both ends of the Reform Party's
convoluted presidential nomination process Friday night, but that
didn't stop breakaway dissidents from choosing their own candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Physicist John Hagelin, who also is the Natural Law Party's
candidate for president, was chosen by acclamation at a rump
convention being held just down the street from where Buchanan was
nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Both Buchanan and Hagelin will send their nomination papers to
the Federal Election Commission, which will be asked to decide
which man gets the Reform Party nomination _ and the $12.5 million
in federal funds that go to the nominee's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be just one more colorful event in the short but
tumultuous history of the Reform Party,'' predicted Russ Verney, a
former Reform Party chair who helped lead the walkout against
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, last night was more a coronation than a
nomination. To roars and cheers from the crowd, the former
Republican presidential hopeful was the only person placed in
nomination. He named Ezola Foster, a 62-year-old black former
teacher and conservative activist, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 minutes, speakers hammered on the issues Buchanan
opposes: abortion, illegal immigration, NAFTA and foreign military
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan will never allow the blood of our children to be
shed where there's no American interest,'' said Jennifer Giroux, a
Cincinnati nurse and mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Buchanan was nominated virtually unanimously, with
only a handful of other votes and abstentions. Missing, however,
were about 140 delegates who had made their way to the opposition
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan showed up briefly in the convention hall after the vote
to thank the delegates for their support. He is slated to return
Saturday evening to give his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the national press corps when they wrote us off nine
months ago: `You don't know this peasant army,' '' he told the
cheering, confetti-drenched crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan played some political hardball Friday afternoon to
clear the way for his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While the convention schedule called for the party to announce,
state by state, results of the party's mail-in presidential ballot,
Buchanan's backers were having none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do (the mail-in count) for three hours,''
Bay Buchanan, Buchanan's sister and political adviser, said Friday
morning. ``We're going to nominate Pat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the convention overwhelmingly voted to dump the
party's mail-in primary, ignoring more than 78,000 people who had
cast the ballots that were supposed to choose the party nominee.
Instead, the convention, packed with Buchanan supporters, picked
the nominee to chants of ``Go Pat Go.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Buchanan landed 64 percent of the mail-in
vote, which provided the icing on the cake for his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you going to choose now, Jimmy?'' taunted convention
chairman Gerry Moan, in a dig aimed at Jim Mangia, head of the
dissident group.
</P>
<P>
   For delegates at the rump convention, the answer was easy. They
disqualified Buchanan for allegedly stuffing the mail-in ballot box
and nominated Hagelin, the only candidate left standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of the mail-in vote wasn't any surprise, since we
knew that Buchanan had sent ballots to 500,000 people ineligible to
vote,'' said Bob Roth, a spokesman for Hagelin. ``That's why we
disqualified him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 900,000 ballots were sent out by the Reform Party. There
is no way to determine how many of the votes returned, if any, may
have come from ineligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   The party dissidents already plan to challenge Buchanan's
nomination. Mangia filed a second suit with the Federal Election
Committee Friday, seeking to deny Buchanan the $12.5 million in
federal funds that will go to the Reform Party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only begun to fight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan demonstrated the control he holds over his half of the
Reform Party's dueling conventions by naming Foster as his
hand-picked running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Foster lives in Los Angeles and spent 33 years as a teacher and
administrator. She was a co-chair of Buchanan's unsuccessful run
for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and followed him
into the Reform Party when he bolted the GOP last year.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Foster as a lifelong Christian who wants to bring
prayer back into the schools, Buchanan said that she ``has been
with me through every tough battle and hardship we have had.''
</P>
<P>
   By bypassing Reform Party leaders in favor of his longtime
supporter, Buchanan made it clear that he's the new party boss.
</P>
<P>
   Foster will ``contradict all the myths and nonsense about what
this new party is about,'' Buchanan told reporters at a news
conference with the Queen Mary in the background. ``It is open. We
welcome everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   As a politician, Foster tried twice to unseat then-Assemblywoman
Maxine Waters and was a prominent supporter of Proposition 187, the
1994 ballot measure that sought to deny most state aid to illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to continue our compassion, but cease being stupid,''
said Foster, who has argued that illegal immigration hurts poor
black workers the most. ``We need to protect American people and
American shores.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster also said the ongoing fight over use of the Confederate
battle flag should not be a racial issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederate flag is part of our history,'' she said.

BEDFORD WINS THE 100-METER BACKSTROKE TO CLINCH AN OLYMPIC BERTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After thrice witnessing her daughter come to the
Olympic trials and fail to make the U.S. swim team, Jane Bedford
decided that this time would be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stayed home,'' former Texas Longhorns swimmer B.J. Bedford
said. ``She thinks she's a jinx.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of what happened Friday night, therefore, amid
the giggles and the hugs, daughter Bedford had a happy phone call
to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bbblllhhhrrrmmhhhrrrggg,'' B.J. said, mimicking the likely
conversation. ``I don't know if I'm ever going to get the words
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl who twice missed curfew on road trips and had to leave
the U.S. resident team, the free spirit who shaved her head before
the '96 trials just like the guys do, the college athlete who once
showed up at morning practice at UT wearing her clothes from the
night before because she had just gotten in _ Jane Bedford's jinxed
kid _ at long last made the Olympic team Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when fellow Texas ex Josh Davis set a U.S. record in
the 200-meter freestyle and when America's stars shone as expected,
Bedford won the 100-meter backstroke in 1 minute, 1.85 seconds,
leaped from the pool, and began hugging everything in sight _ a
judge, a stranger, a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't discriminate between animate or inanimate objects,''
Bedford explained with mock seriousness. ``I will hug anybody after
I make the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200 free, Davis led from wall to wall and toppled
an American record set by Matt Biondi that had stood for 12 years.
Which was the plan all along, the San Antonio native said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember watching Matt on TV when I was 15 years old,'' said
Davis, whose 1:47.26 eclipsed Biondi's 1:47.72. ``He was my idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was to swim 1:47.5 and to break Biondi's record.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Malchow of Ann Arbor, Mich., set the only other record of
the day when he broke Mel Stewart's Olympic trials mark in the
prelims of the 200-meter butterfly. Malchow, who holds the world
record in the event (1:55.18) swam 1:55.67 to break the meet mark
in the morning and was easily the fastest qualifier (1:56.67) in
the evening semis.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100-meter backstroke finals, Sydney gold medal favorite
Lenny Krayzelburg of Studio City, Calif., was first in 53.84,
finishing just ahead of Texas ex Neil Walker (54.85).
</P>
<P>
   Confident 16-year-old Megan Quann of Puyallup, Wash., who broke
the American record in the prelims, won the women's 100
breaststroke in 1:07.26, ahead of California-Berkeley's Staciana
Stitts.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won three gold medals at the Atlanta Games, but this
clearly will be a different Olympics. His wife, Shantel, is
expecting the couple's third child during the same September week
when the Olympic team is supposed to head for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's provided a lot of incentive,'' he said, ``because I
have a lot of diapers to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis plans to return to Austin on Sept. 4, when doctors will
induce labor. He will rejoin the team after the baby is born.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, meanwhile, is 27 and planning a wedding. Her fiance,
Tom Sorensen, just heard the disappointing news that he would be an
alternate on the U.S. Olympic volleyball team and would not be
competing in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   For Bedford, an admitted chronic worrier, it was not a good way
to launch the week. Though she is a 13-time gold medalist in
international competition, Bedford had always come up short at the
Olympic Trials, including 1996 when she shaved her blonde locks
clean.
</P>
<P>
   She said it grew back like a fuzzy tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
   While on one trip with the U.S. swim team, she missed a 10:30
p.m. curfew, arriving at 7 a.m., she explained, because she was
visiting a friend and didn't want to wake her roommate. She
eventually left the resident team in Colorado Springs, Colo., she
said, ``because people come to little gerbil windows each day and
watch you. They can't have people screwing up on that team, and
that was me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke the rules. I served my time. But I'm a good girl
now.'' nn

HOTEL THAT ONCE STOOD FOR GLAMOUR MAY SOON FALL IN COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Once a playground for Hollywood's glitterati,
L.A.'s Ambassador Hotel was a fabulous night spot where you might
bump into Charlie Chaplin one night or F. Scott Fitzgerald the
next.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was the site of a tragedy that shook the nation: On
June 5, 1968, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, fresh from a stunning victory
in California's Democratic presidential primary, was assassinated
at the Ambassador by Sirhan Sirhan.
</P>
<P>
   The image of RFK dying on the kitchen floor was indelibly burned
into the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a national shrine to Bobby Kennedy's memory or a
symbol of the glamorous past in Los Angeles, the Ambassador is a
vacant eyesore - a symbol of the city's political paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually since it was closed 11 years ago, the Ambassador has
been the object of a complex series of legal battles on one front
between the Los Angeles Unified School District and a group of
private developers that once included Donald Trump and Magic
Johnson. On a second front, preservationists and the local business
community have been fighting about it.
</P>
<P>
   The site hasn't become a high school campus in an area with the
most severely overcrowded schools. And it hasn't become a retail
complex in an area badly in need of economic development. And, of
course, the building hasn't been torn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible shame,'' said Margaret Burk, author of an
Ambassador history and its publicity director for 22 years. ``That
hotel I believe at one time in its life was better known than any
other hotel in the world. There were princes and kings and queens
and potentates and maharajahs, the emperor of Japan and presidents.
Everybody came to the Ambassador.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel spawned many legends - as when Albert Einstein called
the front desk to complain about the couple fighting next door:
boxer Jack Dempsey was trying to throw his new bride out the
window. Numerous careers were launched at the hotel's Cocoanut
Grove nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   But after the RFK assassination, guests canceled en masse. It
became known morbidly as the place where Bobby Kennedy was killed,
the place where the dreams of millions of Americans were shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Among the millions stunned that night was a 26-year-old Yale law
graduate named Joseph Lieberman, who had been inspired by Kennedy
and had become chairman of his Connecticut campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, of course, is heading to Los Angeles as Al Gore's
choice for vice president. The 1968 presidential campaign still
holds a place in his heart. ``It was probably the last campaign I
really felt passion about,'' he was quoted as saying two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There were some attempts to revive the hotel, located in the
3400 block of Wilshire Boulevard two blocks east of Normandie
Avenue, but the owners didn't put enough money into modernizing,
according to former employees. And the gradual shifting of the
luxury hotel market west to Beverly Hills was the final blow. The
hotel closed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the Ambassador became a stepchild to downtown
development.
</P>
<P>
   The latest twist came earlier this week when bankruptcy
protection was sought by the owners who bought the 23.5-acre site
after the hotel closed. They turned to bankruptcy court and
restructuring not because they'd run out of cash, but as a tactic
to prevent foreclosure by the school district.
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD became involved in 1990 when, needing another downtown
high school, it placed a $48 million deposit on the property to
begin eminent domain proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But when the real estate market collapsed in the early 1990s,
district officials backed off, hoping to get it at a cheaper price.
Later they changed course and decided to build the nation's
costliest school, called the Belmont Learning Center, but abandoned
this half-built blunder after spending $175 million because of
serious environmental problems. This week, district officials tried
to foreclose on the Ambassador property and force a sheriff's sale
to recover the deposit - which the developers spent to pay their
mortgage - plus interest. The owners filed for restructuring the
day before the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The owners say they need to demolish the hotel and create new
commercial and residential development on the entire site so they
can repay the school district, whose officials claim the debt is
more than $70 million including interest.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   That upsets Los Angeles preservationists, who see no reason why
the hotel building can't be used as part of a new development. It
could easily be converted into housing for senior citizens or even
a school, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned and very opposed to (demolition),'' said
Ken Bernstein, director of preservation for the Los Angeles
Conservancy. ``We've worked very closely with the developers and
the school district on those various options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that a plan would emerge from the bankruptcy
court that would respect all three goals - that would enable
sensible community development to proceed on the site, that would
enable the school district to proceed with a much-needed school on
a portion of the property and that would preserve one of our city's
most historic buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Not likely, according to the developers, who say their hand was
forced by the school district. They were ready to compromise and
build a middle school on a portion of the property, but officials
say they need a high school, which is opposed by many local
businesses and would take up more of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reusing the hotel is probably not as effective as full-site
development,'' said George Host, vice president of S.D. Malkin
Properties, one of the lead developers. ``Our focus is completely
on repaying the school board. It's unfortunate they pushed it to
this point.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials point to a desperate need for classrooms in an
area many students must leave aboard buses to attend high school.
They are willing to settle for a 12-acre portion of the property,
but say this campus must be for a high school, which developers and
the business community call incompatible with retail development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they kick out the kids, the kids are going to have to go to
another site,'' said Caprice Young, the school board member whose
district encompasses the hotel. She said sites are hard to find in
a densely populated area.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, she remains hopeful that bankruptcy court can
provide sort of an independent arbitrator, open to proposals for a
school there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Young said. ``But what I've discovered in this
whole process is if anything can go wrong, it will.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate and the likely demolition leave nothing but memories
for those who witnessed the heyday of the Ambassador Hotel and the
Cocoanut Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Like Marshall Wright, 82, who was the hotel's residential
manager during the early 1950s. He recalls a constant flow of
celebrities and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Among numerous anecdotes, he remembers being drafted by gossip
columnist Louella Parsons to serve as an escort on the town for
Marilyn Monroe on nights when she was fighting with Joe DeMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louella told me to take her (Monroe) home, and I was leaving
the hotel with her,'' Wright recalled about one night. ``Just as I
go down the steps, I see - in the mirror - the reflection of Joe
hiding behind a pillar. I just stopped right there on the stairs. I
said, Good night, Marilyn. I wasn't about to tackle Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMaggio remained friendly with Wright. ``We had drinks and
talked about that later,'' Wright said, ``and he laughed. He was
terribly jealous of her. He died still loving her.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright went back and visited the hotel about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke down and cried in the lobby. They asked me why I was
crying. I said if you had the memories I have of this hotel, you
would cry, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crowning thing in my life. I had bigger jobs in my
life after that, but nothing could ever surpass working at the
Ambassador.''

KYLE PETTY'S DAUGHTER CARRIES FAMILY'S COMPETITIVE FIRE ATOP REAL
HORSE POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Pattie] Petty fills with emotion as her
daughter enters a plush press room at the American Quarter Horse
Youth Association World Championship Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' Pattie says, ``this is the type of place where your
daddy goes to every week.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar place to the Pettys, a place of comfort and
accommodation _ computers, phones, faxes and closed-circuit TV to
the oval-shaped arena, a course similar to a racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Montgomery Lee Petty's arena. While her patriarchs
made a dynasty of the family name by racing cars in circles at
nearly 200 mph, the family's youngest member is earning her spurs
by riding horses in circles at less than 10 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of life's lessons that you have to learn out
there and you have to make your own way,'' Pattie Petty said. ``Our
last name opens doors sometimes and other times it shuts them right
in our face. Montgomery Lee has to learn that. She has to learn the
balance of not expecting doors to open for her because of who she
is. She's got to work very hard to prove herself separate from her
last name.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a family name that has seen its share of sorrow this year
with the deaths of Montgomery Lee's brother Adam and
great-grandfather Lee.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the 14-year-old daughter of NASCAR Winston Cup
driver Kyle Petty is the center of attention at John Justin Arena
in Fort Worth, where she competed this week in the world's toughest
youth equine competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the difference in what I do and what Montgomery Lee
does is that I try to go as fast as I can and she goes as slow as
she can,'' Kyle Petty said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Lee Petty is a star in this arena, having won the
youth quarter horse all-around championship for North Carolina in
1999 and earning her first berth to the Fort Worth championships.
Quarter horses are the world's largest breed, and Montgomery Lee
excels in one of its toughest disciplines: Western Pleasure. At
this week's championships, she reached the semifinals in the event,
in which horses are judged how smoothly they, walk, trot and gallop
around the arena.
</P>
<P>
   She] competes in a sport that includes youth from other affluent
families, and some parents hire adult trainers to ready a horse for
competition. Not the Pettys. Montgomery Lee has trainers and plenty
of horse power, but she insists on preparing her horse, and
practices the same strenuous work ethic that made the Pettys NASCAR
royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what you do, whether it's horses or auto racing, you
should work for your win and you should really deserve it,''
Montgomery Lee said. ``I don't think that it's fair for me to get
up at 5 o'clock in the morning to get ready for a show and other
kids sleep until noon, and then win the class. When that happens, I
think, `Whoa!' When I compete on my pleasure horse, I'll go out
there and work him for five hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Lee rides on a picturesque, 400-acre spread of wooded
rolling hills near Greensboro, N.C., where she grew up. She has
trainers, Stacy Hullett, who lives on the family farm, and Mitch
and Jennifer Leckey from Florida, and two expensive horses with
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Montgomery Lee began rising before dawn and
tending to her horses two years ago that her parents purchased
veteran show horses for their daughter. Until then, she rode horses
that weren't hitting on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as she works at it, we'll give her the tools that she
needs,'' Pattie Petty said. ``Her dad is in racing and he knows
that winning depends on having the right equipment. It's the same
in horses, if you don't have the right equipment, all of the work
in the world won't get you in the ring. As long as Montgomery Lee
is diligent and humble, we'll give her what she needs.''
</P>
<P>
   While her brothers Adam and Austin grew up with wrenches and
grease, Montgomery Lee preferred hay and bridal bits. She began
riding at 3 atop small ponies at the family farm. ``When I was
about 5 or 6], I got drug around by a pony and I was scared of
horses for the longest time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She resumed her riding career at 10 when the family purchased a
golden palomino named Trigger, named after Roy Rogers' horse. She
also learned horsemanship skills on an old cow pony named Kelly
that her mother kept on the farm for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Montgomery Lee has a smoother ride on her veteran show
horses, These Eyes Adore Thee (in showmanship, Western Horsemanship
and trail riding) and Mr. Magnolia Zip, which carried her to the
Western Pleasure semifinals Wednesday in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   When times are bleak, riding also helps Montgomery Lee smooth
rough emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make you feel better about yourself,'' she said. ``When
things aren't going well, Stacy \RHullett\S and I go on a long
trail ride. It's great because my horses can fly. We'll end the
ride with a race back to the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pettys are focusing on being upbeat after their son Adam,
19, was killed in an auto racing accident May 12. More than a month
earlier, her great-grandfather Lee Petty died at the age of 86. Her
mother requested that Montgomery Lee, who delivered a moving eulogy
at her brother's funeral, not be asked about the tragedy.
Montgomery Lee wears a necklace with a heart-shaped emblem and
Adam's name.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her greatest tribute to Adam is competing in the Petty
spirit, which has helped the family triumph and cope with
misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I passed on the `have fun' part to her,'' said Kyle
Petty, who was in Fort Worth this week before leaving for the
NASCAR Winston Cup race in Watkins Glen, N.Y. He says his wife,
Pattie ``is more competitive and Montgomery Lee gets that part from
her mother. I just hope that when she's 35, she remembers that she
came to the Fort Worth youth show at 14 and had a good time, and,
oh by the way, she did well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Montgomery Lee competed Wednesday, she was dressed as
colorfully as her dad at Winston Cup races. Except that her black
suit, with a jagged pink top with silver sequins, wasn't filled
with sponsorship patches.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., she sat in a humid, dimly lit stall walkway
peering into a small mirror. As the buzzing fans blew mist nearby
to cool the area, she put on makeup, and adjusted her black
Stetson.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., she walked to the arena, chatted with her mother in
the grandstands, and then to a gritty and aeromatic warmup area to
prepare her horse. Two hours later, she showed the animal in the
first round and advanced to the semifinals. Though it appeared she
had a smooth ride in the semifinals, she was denied a final-round
berth.
</P>
<P>
   But she drew plenty of affirmation from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens, my mom and dad are always proud of
me,'' Montgomery Lee said. ``Daddy always says to me to go into the
ring and smile, and have fun at it, no matter whether I win or
lose.'' nn

HINGIS, DAVENPORT ADVANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ The roles switched and suddenly all
eyes were on Amy Frazier instead of Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, the world's top-ranked player, found herself almost as
an underdog because Frazier had upset her last week in Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   So all eyes _ and fans' encouragements _ were on Frazier in
Friday's estyle.com Classic quarterfinal at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Those well-wishers came away disappointed, as Hingis needed just
53 minutes to dispatch Frazier 6-2, 6-1 and set up a semifinal
matchup today against fifth-seeded and defending champion Serena
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited to go out there and play her,'' Hingis
said. ``In a way, I had nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's other semifinal, unseeded Elena Demetrieva's
nightmare of facing second-seeded Lindsay Davenport came true.
Demetrieva beat Lisa Raymond 2-6, 6-1, 6-4, and Davenport took care
of No. 8 Sandrine Testud 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for me to play Testud,'' Demetrieva said.
</P>
<P>
   It was better for Hingis to get another chance at Frazier so
soon. Last week, Frazier shocked Hingis 6-3, 6-3 in the
quarterfinals at Carlsbad, Hingis later saying the loss was a
``wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I'm a different player from last week,''
Hingis said. ``I was ready for her game better because I knew a bit
from last time what's her strength and weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   So did everyone. Frazier admits she's a one-dimensional player
who wins or loses by her groundstrokes. Her serve certainly won't
win any raves. Hingis broke her all seven times she served.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Frazier, her groundstrokes also were too
inconsistent, too many going long or wide. Plus, Hingis made fewer
unforced errors than last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, last week was last week,'' Frazier said. ``I've
played her so many times and lost. She didn't make any errors. . .
. She was running down the shots and I found I had to go for the
winner maybe a little too early.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't appear Davenport's victory would come early when the
first game lasted eight minutes and had seven deuces. Davenport had
seven break points before finally winning.
</P>
<P>
   Testud finally broke back to tie the set at 2-2, but by then
Davenport had found her stroke and the shots weren't sailing long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I hit the ball a lot better,'' Davenport said. ``I
was hitting the ball deeper and feeling like I could make shots,
work points a little more and go for the shots. I felt a lot more
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Demetrieva is the lesser-known of the remaining players. While
the others have Grand Slam titles to their credit, the 18-year-old
has never reached a WTA final and has just two other semifinal
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of those appearances was this year at Indian Wells
(where she lost to Davenport), and she's ranked 32nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say thank you to Monica,'' Demetrieva said of
Monica Seles, whose withdrawl opened Demetrieva's part of the
bracket. ``She gave me the chance to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying here, however, will be tough. Demetrieva appears
intimidated by Davenport. The two have faced off twice this year,
with Demetrieva never winning more than three games in any set.

THE SPORTS WORLD AT A GLANCE; THE EYES HAVE IT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Combine the end of the week with the end of your rope and,
voila, welcome to Whitt's End.
</P>
<P>
   'Twas the beginning of The End ... when I can see clearly now,
the pain is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Actually during last Thursday's LASIK eye surgery, it was no
pain, mo' gain. Unless of course, you consider pain to be the
queasy discomfort of having your eyelids locked open with a
crowbar, having to focus your dilated iris on a red laser you're
certain is burning your cornea because you can smell it, all while
the surgeon reminds you how ``gravely important'' it is to be
perfectly motionless.
</P>
<P>
   To some, that simple irritating imagery is enough for a lifetime
``I Do'' to contacts or glasses. But to a certain fuzzy-focused
sportswriter who often saw more stars than in tonight's Perseid
Meteor Shower and a handful of precious pupils from Tiger Woods, to
Troy Aikman, to Bob Costas, to Cindy Crawford to even Kurt Rambis
(who traded in his trademark horn rims for 20/20), seeing clearly
is believing.
</P>
<P>
   With LASIK quickly gaining on tattoos, headbands and
breathe-right strips as the hottest novelty in sports, a few
suggestions to 10 blurred athletic eyes that should consider the
10-minute procedure to improve their vision, and their visions:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin: Would be able to see his far-sighted career
plummeting from Dallas Playmaker to Huntsville Platemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Jaramillo: Would be able to see that his leg-kick technique
has prodded Gabe Kapler _ not long ago as blind as his bat _ to
record the summer's most consecutive hit singles this side of
Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Firestone: Would be able to see that his name has been blown
out by recalled tires that are evoking new images of the Rolling
'Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson: Would be able to see that if he really wants to sell
out even the binocular-enhancement seats in Reunion Arena he can
grudgingly sign three talented local players, The Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo: Would be able to see that seemingly cross-eyed
backup quarterback Paul Justin needs his own signature boot out of
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Franchione: Would be able to see that even with Heisman
hopeful LaDainian Tomlinson, Outland candidate Aaron Schobel and
the possibility of an undefeated season, it takes a strong case of
astigmatism to envision national respect in light of a schedule
that ranks 107 of 115 in strength.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban: Would be able to see that acquiring a player like
Shawn Kemp with double-figures in points scored and children
fathered is as near-sighted as banning gun shows at Fort Worth
public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   PGA Golfers: Would be able to see that Tiger Woods' 11 victories
in his past 19 tournaments are more than all but one Rangers'
pitcher (Rick Helling) this season, and likely more than the
Cowboys' upcoming total in 2000, thereby prodding them to start
tours of Hide-n-Go-Seek or Eye Spy.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones: Would be able to see that it is better for one of
his former players to be caught with Nelly Adham, rather than
Nellie a Don.
</P>
<P>
   Don King: Would be able to see that boxing is in hotter water
than the Northwest wildfires when Evander Holyfield is on the verge
of an unprecedented fourth heavyweight title and fans are more
consumed with bidding on Joe Frazier's spit bucket on eBay.

crossing.)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Nellie stopping a Mavericks game to run to mid-court to
dispute a charging call, or Dave Campo jogging into the end zone to
discuss a controversial interference penalty against the Cowboys.
As those two actions would be, managers should be immediately
penalized for their ridiculous wastes of time, matched in futility
only by fighting in hockey. In basketball it's a technical foul, in
football it's unsportsmanlike conduct, in baseball it should be an
automatic out.
</P>
<P>

the dugout? Give them bullhorns or flash cards, anything to keep
them off the field.  &LR; subheds:MOVIE SNEAK PREVIEW  &LR; body:The

Park. Along with the other banalities, eclectic scab players from
Sumo wrestlers to deaf tight ends bond, the old coach gets back his

AN `AMAZING' REACTION TO LAST-PLACE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The loudest cheer of Friday's morning 200-meter
butterfly prelims at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials came not for
one of the heat winners, but for Austin's Isaac Grombacher, who
finished in last place.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Austin St. Stephens, Grombacher went to
Texas and majored in mechanical engineering, but did not swim for
the Longhorns. He stayed in the sport through the Austin-based swim
club, Texas Aquatics.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Grombacher began to experience headaches. A month
later, doctors discovered a brain tumor. Grombacher underwent
surgery on May 8, and though the tumor proved to be benign, he was
paralyzed on the left side of his body for two weeks after the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Since he had already qualified to compete, Grombach said,
``Swimming at the trials became my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   As he swam in his preliminary-round heat Friday, the announcer
at the IU Natatorium told Isaac's story to the audience. What
started out as respectful applause became a roar as Grombacher,
swimming in last place, neared the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I touched the wall, I heard this amazing sound,'' said
Grombacher, whose time was 2 minutes, 14.40 seconds. ``It was one
of the best feelings of my life. The whole time I was in the
hospital, I never dreamed it would be like this. It was just
amazing.'' CRAMPING TORRES WITHDRAWS
</P>
<P>
   One day after making the Olympic team in the women's 100-meter
butterfly, Dara Torres of Palo Alto, Calif., experienced cramping
and was forced to withdraw from the semifinals of Friday night's
200-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dara has a history of severe uterine cramping during long
races such as this one,'' said Dr. Glen Luepnitz of the Stanford
Swim Club. ``The cramping can be debilitating.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres had hoped to finish in the top six of the event in order
to qualify for the 4x200 relay in Sydney. She won her heat with the
morning's fifth-fastest time, 2:01.04, but began to get chills
during her warmdown.
</P>
<P>
   She is expected to still compete in Sunday's preliminaries of
the 100-meter freestyle. The rules allow Torres to petition to the
Olympic head coach for a spot in the relay. The coach happens to be
her personal one, former Texas coach Richard Quick.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Teuscher, who earned a relay gold medal at the Atlanta
Olympics, also scratched from the 200 free semis in order to
concentrate on the 200-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   The scratches opened up a spot in 200 free semis for Texas A&AMP;M's
Monica Williams. She is the daughter of Boston Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams. A native of Dunedin, Fla., Monica swam 2:03.23 and
finished 14th, failing to qualify for the finals. nn

PHOENIX FANS NOT X FACTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ You can usually count on Phoenix Mercury fans to show
up when needed. But Friday there were more empty seats than anytime
in the franchise's four-year history. A record-low 6,167 showed up
to watch their beloved Mercury get burned by the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Never an easy place to play, Phoenix ranks second behind Houston
and in front of New York as the toughest place to play, according
to Sparks forward DeLisha Milton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just how energetic the atmosphere is,'' Milton said in
explaining why Phoenix is tough. ``The fans are knowledgeable. They
really do pride themselves on being the sixth man or the X
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But through all the chants _ ``Beat L.A.'' _ the yelling and
screaming and taunts, the Sparks have been amazingly focused to
block out the X factor this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is the same, it's the fans,'' Sparks center Lisa
Leslie said. ``We've played here so many times now, it's kind of
like we're immune to that. When they're yelling `Beat L.A.' we're
thinking, `We're L.A..' We're so focused on the game now that it
doesn't really play a factor, the whole X factor.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Matter of conditioning: The Sparks weren't just blowing hot
air when they said they were the best-conditioned team in the
league. When you consider only one starter has missed one game
during the 32-game regular season it's easy to come to that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Tamecka Dixon suffered a sprained ankle and missed the
Indiana game June 28 but was back in the lineup for the next game
July 1 against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie said it was a major factor in the Sparks' three
regular-season wins against the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets down to the stretch, whether it's seven minutes
left or five minutes, they're bent over or they seem like they're
fatigued and we're standing up straight like, `Let's go, we're
about to do this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing that stands out in my mind, us being in such
great shape from training camp. It looks like it's really paying
off now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end of the spectrum is Phoenix, which has missed
86 games due to injuries or illness by eight players. Guards
Michelle Timms and Michelle Cleary and center Maria Stepanova are
out with season-ending injuries. Still, the Mercury made the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Check out Lisa: Leslie will be on ``NBA Inside Stuff'' at
10:30 a.m. today on Channel 4.

KRAYZELBURG NEARLY TOPS RECORD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INDIANAPOLIS _ When Tom Sorensen was cut this week from the
U.S. Olympic indoor volleyball team, his fiancee could sympathize.
Oh, boy, could she ever.
</P>
<P>
   Twice B.J. Bedford had competed in the U.S. Olympic Swimming
Trials, but she never had made it to the Summer Games. In 1992, the
future Mrs. Sorensen finished seventh in the 100-meter backstroke.
In 1996, she placed third, missing a berth to Atlanta by a single
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the fine china, Sorensen and Bedford figured they'd
be registering for ``gold galore'' this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they got what they wanted: an Olympic place-setting.
Bedford had to pay a hefty price for it physically, but she won the
100 backstroke at the Trials at IUPUI. She threw up before the race
and her fatigued muscles were on fire the last 10 meters. And yet
she somehow managed to stay ahead of Courtney Shealy, 1996 Olympian
Lea Maurer and Irvine's Diana MacManus, all three of whom were
separated by just .28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do is look at the clock and see who won,''
Bedford said. ''
</P>
<P>
   It was a pretty safe bet that Lenny Krayzelburg would win the
100 backstroke after he came within .07 seconds of his world record
in Thursday's semifinals. He did indeed win, but his final time of
53.84 was .24 seconds slower than his one-year-old global mark.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg's teammate, Kristine Quance-Julian, had the
ninth-fastest semifinal swim in the 200-meter individual medley and
is the first alternate for tonight's final.
</P>
<P>
   The Granada Hills High product will get one more shot at the
event only if someone ahead of her bows out. (It could happen; Dara
Torres had to scratch from the semifinals of the 200 freestyle when
she suffered severe uterine cramps after her preliminary race.)
</P>
<P>
   Quance-Julian is trying to make her second Olympic team 18
months after giving birth to a son. Josh Davis, who broke the
12-year-old American record in the 200-meter freestyle, is another
1996 Olympian who has become a parent over the ensuing four years.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife are expecting their third child around the time
Davis will be trying to deliver a gold medal to the U.S. in Sydney.
Accordingly, his wife is planning to have her labor induced in
Austin, Texas, in early September, before the U.S. team leaves for
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy knows a thing or two about overlapping schedules. For the
past three falls, the recent Georgia graduate juggled varsity
volleyball and varsity swimming. ``I'm glad I'm 6-3 right now,''
Shealy said after touching out the 5-foot-6 Maurer.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Quann is glad she'll be able to start trimming miles from
her training regimen soon, in preparation for an Olympic
breaststroke competition that will pit her against South Africa's
Penny Heyns, the world-record holder in the 100 and 200.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of the 1,309 competitors here cut back
dramatically on their training in the days leading to the meet,
Quann bragged about having swum 20,000 meters a day up until her
100 preliminary race.
</P>
<P>
   Quann spoke for every newly crowned Olympian when she said:
``This is the time of my life. I just made the Olympics!''
</P>
<P>
   Then she said something that might come back to haunt her.
Talking as though she was reading from track star Michael Johnson's
Olympic Trials diary for USA Today, she said, ``Penny, she's going
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg can't wait to go Down Under again; last August, he
set world records in the 50 (a non-Olympic event), 100 and 200
backstrokes at the same pool that will play host to the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   His competitiveness cost him a world record Friday. Runner-up
Neil Walker blasted out of the blocks and Krayzelburg went out with
him, sheepishly explaining, ``I don't want Neil to get to the wall
first, even at the 50.''
</P>
<P>
   After tightening up the final 10 meters, he said, ``It's just a
learning experience for Sydney.''

PROTESTERS UNITED IN SEARCH FOR DEMOCRACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ They're not making speeches or writing the
Democratic party platform, but the 10,000 to 50,000 protesters
expected at the Democratic National Convention will try to play an
influential role.
</P>
<P>
   And because the West Coast activist community is highly
organized, protesters said, they expect a larger turnout next week
than what showed up in Philadelphia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But what, exactly, are the activists protesting?
</P>
<P>
   The days of single issues - like civil rights or anti-war
movements - are over. Today's activists are protesting a long list
of issues from ending the death penalty to halting dam
construction.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one theme unifies them: democracy, they said, has
been taken over by corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real overwhelming issue here is human needs not corporate
greed,'' said Medea Benjamin, founding director of Global Exchange.
``We've got to get the big money out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Exchange, which focuses on fair trade issues and
immigrant rights, is hosting downtown ``Reality Tours'' to point
out the effects of global trade on Los Angeles - from garment
district sweatshops to examples of environmental racism, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Special interests, they said, have overshadowed citizens in the
democratic process, yet this week they'll speak with voices heard
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate interests siphon money from public schools, said Luis
Sanchez of the L.A.-based Youth Organizing Communities, creating
overcrowded classrooms and a scarcity of resources in lower-income
areas, as well as allowing construction of potentially
environmentally unsafe schools - like the Belmont Learning Center,
the nation's costliest school that was abandoned half-built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what's happening in our schools and who is funding
these campaigns,'' he said. ``There is a direct correlation between
this and the dumbing down of California education.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez and Benjamin said their groups will participate in
nearly all organized marches planned for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Becker of the New York-based International Action
Center, said most groups will participate in the majority of
protests, regardless of whether their individual issues are
directly addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a definite correlation between progress and the
strength of people's movements,'' he said. ``This is the continued
emergence of a new movement started in Seattle and Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by concerns over extensive property damage and arrests
in Seattle last fall and in Washington, D.C., this spring, the
D2KLA protest planning group developed a four-part nonviolence
agreement that activists participating in organized events must
sign - the agreement includes a ban on property destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, activists can't control what individuals do on their own,
Becker said, and most protesters distinguish between violence
toward people and property destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a window is not the same as beating a person, said Han
Shan of the Ruckus Society, the Berkeley-based activist training
group. Equating the two, he said, degrades the value of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Property destruction does scare people, though, and we don't
want people to think this revolution is scary,'' he said.

ANARCHISTS' CONVENTION OPENS, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Anarchists Convention kicked off Friday with
security guards on watch for police and about 200 people crammed in
a stifling hot Elysian Park studio.
</P>
<P>
   Blamed for violence and vandalism during Seattle and Washington,
D.C., protests, delegates to the North American Anarchist
Conference meeting in Los Angeles for the Democratic National
Convention started their own convention by embracing each other.
</P>
<P>
   And their first seminar: ``Embrace - Group Affection Workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, graying anarchist Jay Brophy sat in a wicker chair to
discuss ``Liberation Pedagogy,'' telling the spike-haired, black-
and red-dressed anarchists that ``the schools are where the
potential for doing revolutionary work is the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with two-wheeled transportation, a fellow who gave his
name only as Randy taught the art of Zen and bike repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to disappoint the corporate media, but all we're doing
is having workshops,'' said an anarchist whose name tag read
``Idiot.'' ``I don't think bike repair is the same as throwing
bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference runs through Sunday and is taking place at 2431
Eads St.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists insisted they have not planned any ``organized''
protests. They said they plan to participate in nonviolent
demonstrations to protest corporate greed and to advocate their
philosophy, which calls for a radical reorganization of society.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists believe people should live by principles of mutual
aid and cooperation and that hierarchy and all forms of social
domination are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz of the convention was over whether the rumors were
true: Would police harass anyone wearing a circle-A anarchist logo
or people dressed in black?
</P>
<P>
   ``They say anyone wearing a circle-A will be stopped,'' he said.
``We're starting a new kind of scare. It's not the red scare. It's
the black scare.''
</P>
<P>
   An anarchist guard, who refused to identify himself in any way,
said security is necessary because ``our movement is extreme - it's
calling to destroy the complacency of everyday people because they
are afraid to embrace the potential of their own autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brophy, a self-described '70s hippy-turned-anarchist, said
anarchists in Seattle committed acts of vandalism by breaking
corporate building windows only after ``police rioted,'' spraying
people with pepper spray and clubbing them.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects a similar reaction during the convention
here. ``The police will probably riot,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the conference, a La Crescenta mother waited for her
daughter to emerge. She told her mother she`d only go in briefly
but had been gone 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Mom, don't come in. They don't like the
establishment.' I said, oh, that's wonderful.''
</P>

A DEFEAT AND A SCARE: RANGERS' GLYNN PASSES OUT IN DUGOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers received a major scare last
night, when Ryan Glynn, the most promising of the team's young
starting pitchers, passed out in the dugout after being pulled from
the game in the fifth inning of a 7-3 loss to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was unconscious briefly on the floor of the dugout at The
Ballpark in Arlington, and was attended to by the team's trainers
before paramedics arrived. He regained consciousness, and was alert
when he was taken to Arlington Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the hospital, and was expected to remain
there overnight for observation and a variety of tests.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for his collapse, but the stifling heat is
believed to be a factor. It was 98 degrees at game time, with
little or no breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind,'' manager Johnny Oates said of
the heat being the cause. ``I didn't feel too good, and all I did
was sit there and drink liquids all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened after right-hander, 25, had pitched the
first 42/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn had little problems in the first three innings, but he
allowed all seven Boston runs in the fourth and fifth. Catcher Bill
Haselman noticed from Glynn's pitching mechanics that something was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it,'' Haselman said. ``He just seemed to be a
little different after the third inning. He was throwing the ball
around the plate, and then he was nowhere near the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Luis Alicea went to the mound to ask him if he
was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder Scarborough Green said he noticed something
when Glynn came out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked a little wobbly when he came off the mound,''
Green said. ``I remember saying he didn't look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Green watched until Glynn got a drink of water and sat down, and
assumed he was all right, but it soon became obvious he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Frank Catalanotto was sitting to Glynn's left
when the pitcher collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I felt him touch me as he fell,'' Catalanotto said.
``I thought he might have tripped or something, but he was lying
there unconscious. It was really scary for me. I yelled down to the
security guard to radio for someone. It was a scary experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn threw 95 pitches before being relieved. He collapsed while
reliever Doug Davis still was trying to get out of the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have no idea,'' pitcher Kenny Rogers said. ``It's hot
out there, boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength-sapping heat might have been a factor in Glynn's
worst outing in a while. He allowed all seven Red Sox runs (five
earned) on eight hits, including two long home runs by Carl
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was 2-0 with a 3.00 ERA in his previous three starts, and
earned accolades from Oates before the game for the way he was
learning to pitch at the major-league level.
</P>
<P>
   He started out strongly again last night, with three shutout
innings, and appeared to be on his way to another effective outing.
</P>
<P>
   He showed some grit by pitching out of trouble after Nomar
Garciaparra doubled to lead off the second and moved to third on a
grounder to second by Troy O'Leary. Glynn stranded him there by
getting Brian Daubach on a foul pop to first, and Ed Sprague on a
fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth and fifth, the Red Sox began to tee off.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn walked Scott Hatteberg to lead off the fourth, and Everett
followed with his first homer, a shot into the upper deck in right
field. Garciaparra then reached second on an infield single and an
error by third baseman Mike Lamb, and scored on a single by
O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added four runs in the fifth, when they batted
around. Trot Nixon drove in the first run with a single, and
Everett knocked in the next three with a 418-foot homer to center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was pulled after getting Garciaparra on a fly to center
and giving up a single to O'Leary. A couple of minutes later, he
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed for 10 minutes while Glynn received medical
attention. He was sitting up when he was wheeled out of the dugout
and taken to an ambulance. nn

SMALLISH COWBOYS LINEBACKER COAKLEY COMING UP BIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ For as long as he can remember, Dallas
Cowboys weakside linebacker Dexter Coakley has been defined by his
height.
</P>
<P>
   Or lack there of.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley _ generously listed at 5-foot-10 in the Cowboys media
guide, though he is actually closer to 5-8 _ might as well have
added ``undersized'' to his name.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what he did on the football field, the 228-pound
Coakley was never able to escape the stigma of being considered an
oddity because of his atypical linebacker size.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley's 1999 campaign _ a team-high four interceptions, a
second-best 131 tackles and All-Pro honors _ has made him a novelty
no more.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year veteran heads into the 2000 season simply
regarded as a football player. And a very good one at that.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a definitely a great feeling,'' Coakley said. ``All my
career I've always been dealing with `is he big enough?' and `can
he get the job done?'. I've used that as a burning fire. I used
that as fuel that was thrown on that fire constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've ever wanted was people to accept me as a football
player. It's a great a feeling to know that you are now looked upon
as a football player, not a short guy who is probably not capable
enough to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have never questioned Coakley's ability. After
drafting the unknown Appalachian State product in third round of
the 1997 draft, Cowboys chief scout Larry Lacewell remarked that
the Cowboys got him to play football not ``change light bulbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley has done nothing but play football since his arrival in
Dallas. As a rookie, he won the starting weakside linebacker job
before the team broke training camp. He set a Cowboys rookie record
with 136 stops, earning consensus all-Rookie honors.
</P>
<P>
   He has simply gotten better each year since, culminating with
last season's award-winning performance. Coakley was the first
Cowboys linebacker to play in the Pro Bowl since Ken Norton in 1993
and the first to lead the team in interceptions since Eugene
Lockhart in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys assistant coach Tommie Robinson said skeptics should
have been measuring Coakley's heart and talent instead of his
height.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, who has exceeded expectations throughout his NFL
career, could be the fastest linebacker in the league. The former
high school running back has run the 40-yard dash in 4.28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is not better; better is better,'' Robinson said.
``Dexter is a great football player. He is talented, and nobody
works harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley said he was inspired by Sam Mills and Zach Thomas, two
other small linebackers who have achieved greatness despite their
size. He said he hopes he is an example to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I am,'' he said. ``I hope I'm following in that same
mold (of Mills and Thomas). People told me I couldn't get it done,
and I'm proving them all wrong. I want people to learn from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley already has a disciple in Cowboys middle linebacker Dat
Nguyen (5-11, 230), who is facing similar questions about his size
as he heads into his first year as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who paved the road for myself to get me an
opportunity to have a chance to be where I am,'' Nguyen said.
``He's been going through obstacles all his life. He's definitely a
guy I look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley is pleased with his play last season and his new-found
level of respect; however, he says he is not satisfied. He says he
still has a lot of work to do and goals to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to the Pro Bowl,'' Coakley said.
``Hopefully I can achieve greatness in this league. But I've still
got a lot of improvement to do. This is just the tip of the iceberg
on what I'm capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What Coakley says he refuses to worry about, however, is owner
Jerry Jones' tradition of not paying linebackers top salaries. A
free agent after the season, Coakley understands that he could be
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, who could command roughly $5 million a year on the open
market next season, points to his $1.027 million contract in 2000,
which is the highest for a linebacker in team history, as a glimmer
of hope. He's trusting that his on-field play will prompt the
Cowboys to alter their philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Departed linebackers Randall Godfrey, Dixon Edwards, Darrin
Smith and Norton all thought the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, however, has made a career out of breaking down
barriers. nn

KAPLER EXTENDS STREAK TO 24 GAMES TO TIE CLUB RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ On a night when he became a part of Rangers
history and also stranded three runners on base for the final out
in a 7-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox, Rangers center fielder Gabe
Kapler was calm in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable and I feel confident,'' said Kapler, who
tied Mickey Rivers' record for hitting safely in 24 consecutive
games. ``I feel great at the plate. The ball feels like it's coming
in slow motion. I feel no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last at-bat, Kapler hit a slow line drive to second
baseman Mike Lansing to end the game, but it was his second-to-last
at-bat, a single up the middle, that put him in the Rangers' record
books.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the bottom of the eighth inning, all eyes at the
Ballpark in Arlington were on Kapler. Hitless in his previous three
at-bats, Kapler's 23-game hitting streak was in jeopardy and the
crowd cheered loudly.
</P>
<P>
   They also booed loudly when the count reached 3-0 in
anticipation of what was sure to be a walk and the end of his
hitting streak. But Kapler singled to tie the record and keep the
streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately that ball got under \RRed Sox shortstop\S Nomar
\RGarciaparra\S,'' Kapler said. ``But I would have traded a hit for
a couple of RBI in key situations tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's 24-game hitting streak ties the longest hitting streak
in the major leagues this season and Rivers' 20-year record. Tony
Womack of Arizona also hit in 24 consecutive games from May 2-29
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler ended the first inning on a fielder's choice to
Garciaparra. A slow line drive to right field in the fourth inning
was followed by another ground out to Garciaparra in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Before last night's performance, Kapler was 34-of-93, with six
home runs and 19 runs batted in during his streak. He raised his
batting average from .241 to .281.
</P>
<P>
   After Kapler's single, Rangers first base coach Bobby Jones
tossed the ball into the dugout.

STARS, SLOAN READY TO FACE ARBITER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars will venture into previously untested waters this
morning when they meet winger Blake Sloan in a franchise-first
arbitration hearing in the hope of settling a contract impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan filed for arbitration this summer after the Stars extended
him a qualifying offer that would give him a 10 percent raise from
his salary of $357,000 last season if he plays the entire season
with the Stars. But he'd be paid significantly less for any time
spent playing for their minor-league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   The contract the Stars offered is called a two-way contract.
Sloan wants a one-way contract that would guarantee him his salary
no matter whether he played for the Stars or the Grizzlies this
season. Sloan played 67 of 82 games, all for the Stars, last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear picture of how we view him as a player as does
he,'' Stars general Bob Gainey said. ``Somebody else will decide
and then we'll move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said he didn't foresee an agreement being reached before
this morning although both sides have talked.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the decision, the Stars will have a contract with their
last unsigned player from last season within the next 48 hours. The
arbitrator has that long to give a ruling. But Gainey said the
team's roster is in no way finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be looking to add some players,'' Gainey said, noting a
defenseman and at least one more forward, ``sounded right. ... We
told everybody we're in a waiting period until we got all our
players signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the Stars added one new player, acquiring right
winger David Ling from the Chicago Blackhawks for future
considerations. The 5-foot-9, 185-pound Ling, 25, spent the past
two seasons with the Kansas City Blades of the International Hockey
League. He was ninth-round selection of the Quebec Nordiques in the
1993 NHL Entry Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also have been talking to several free agents _
defenseman Dave Manson and forwards Claude Lemieux, Ted Donato and
Stephane Richer. The Stars' training camp begins Sept. 9 in Vail,
Colo., and their first exhibition is scheduled for Sept. 14 against
Colorado in Denver.

COWBOYS' GREG ELLIS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IN RETURN FROM LEG INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys defensive end Greg Ellis is ``one
week ahead of schedule,'' head coach Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, who will probably get in some preseason game work (either
Aug. 19 at Denver or Aug. 24 vs. St. Louis) because of his
progress, returned to team practice this week for the first time
since breaking his left leg in two places eight months ago today.
It was one week earlier than either the medical or
strength/conditioning staffs expected.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing it as a psychological breakthrough as much as a physical
accomplishment, Ellis felt he passed the so-called ``flinch test''
with flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this week, including team drills during yesterday's second
practice, the third-year player found 300-pound bodies caving in
around his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time it went through my head: `Let's make
sure nobody rolls into it.' It wasn't like I was scared or nothing.
... I pretty much was just being smart about the whole deal,'' said
Ellis, who suffered the career-threatening injury Dec. 12 against
Philadelphia and has a titanium rod in his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is expected to be ready for the Cowboys' Sept. 3
regular-season opener against Philadelphia. He finished the week
with soreness in his leg and throughout his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's to be expected,'' he said. ``Thank God I'm just able to
do everything as if nothing ever happened.'' \Nsubheds:Harris to
hold in a pinch Tight end Jackie Harris yesterday joined Randall
Cunningham as an emergency backup holder to rookie Micah Knorr, who
has the inside track for the punting job. The Cowboys are making
sure they have a holder on field goals and extra points who will be
active each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got accused of having pretty decent hands,'' laughed Harris,
who says he will take a couple of reps after each practice until he
feels confident. ``I've never-ever in my entire football life done
this.'' \Nsubheds:Justin No. 4 Paul Justin is expected to be the
fourth quarterback to play against the Oakland Raiders tomorrow
night, following rookie Clint Stoerner.
</P>
<P>
   Campo explained that the coaches want to see Stoerner work with
and against something other than bottom-rung players, adding that
flip-flopping the order is not a reflection on Justin, even though
he has six turnovers (four interceptions, two lost fumbles) in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about job security, Justin, 32, replied, ``I don't
even think about it. I've just got to get going. It's pretty
black-and-white: Eliminate turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Justin's fourth team in four years. He doesn't feel that
he's pressing, although he said he is frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to the guys all the time. Sometimes, I get tired of
talking,'' Justin said. ``We've just got to produce as a group, and
we haven't done that in the first two games.''

JARAMILLO HIRING CONTINUES TO BE A HIT FOR OATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It was just supposed to be breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Some bacon and eggs, a couple of slices of wheat toast with a
little strawberry jam. Two or three cups of coffee and a polite,
``Don't call us, we'll call you,'' line to wrap things up.
</P>
<P>
   That's what new Texas manager Johnny Oates was thinking when he
agreed to interview Rudy Jaramillo in October 1994. After all,
Oates already had two other candidates in mind to be his first
Rangers' hitting coach. This would be a simple courtesy meeting to
satisfy a whim of general manager Doug Melvin's.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, the Rangers' new skipper had made what might
have been the most fortuitous hire of his managerial career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He blew me away,'' Oates recalled, retelling what has become
an almost legendary story in Rangers circles. ``I had to tip the
waitress for two meals, we were in the (hotel) restaurant for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Going on six years later, Jaramillo might just be the best
hitting coach in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been six years and the horses keep changing,'' Oates said
before Friday night's opener of a six-game homestand against the
Red Sox at The Ballpark in Arlington, ``but we keep getting the
field plowed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Oates' colorful way of saying that the players come and
go, but the Rangers continue to remain at or near the top of the
American League charts in hitting.
</P>
<P>
   They started play Friday night ranked second in the league in
hitting at .290. If they can catch the White Sox (.293) before
season's end, Jaramillo's hitters will have led the league three
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to spring training this year we'd lost Juan
(Gonzalez), Lee Stevens, Todd Zeile, (Mark) McLemore, (Roberto)
Kelly and (Tom) Goodwin,'' Jaramillo said. ``That was a lot of RBIs
gone, but on the first day I told them I didn't expect any less
from the offense and that the standards were going to stay the same
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's no .350-hitting Pudge Rodriguez and no .340-hitting
David Segui either. No matter. The hottest hitter in baseball
during the past three-plus weeks has been Jaramillo's latest star
pupil, Gabe Kapler.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing gains notoriety for a hitting coach like turning around
a player like Kapler, who hit only .245 last season in Detroit and
fell into a deep slump early this season shortly after belting two
home runs on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same Kapler who, with an eighth-inning single
Friday night, extended his hitting streak to 24 games, tying Mickey
Rivers' club record and matching the Arizona Diamondbacks' Tony
Womack for the longest streak in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jaramillo who suggested the leg kick that Kapler now uses
to trigger his swing, allowing him to stay back and wait longer on
the pitch before committing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds different approaches for different hitters,'' Kapler
said. ``The worst possible thing is a guy who thinks there's only
one way to hit. You look around this room and Pudge is successful
in a different way than Raffy is, who's successful in a different
way than Cat (Frank Catalanotto) is, or Luis (Alicea).
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody finds their own way to be successful. If you have a
hitting coach who teaches one way, and your way isn't their way ...
ooh. It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Charlie Lau was a huge success in Kansas City teaching
weight shift and power position. Walt Hriniak had success in Boston
and Chicago with his emphasis on keeping the head down and swinging
through the ball, but Kapler says both techniques are universal for
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy never says, `This is the only way to do it.' He says,
`We're going to find a way to make this click and if one way
doesn't do it, we'll try something else.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of a hitting coach among the players shows when
they leave a club for whatever reason but can't wait to re-visit
their old guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys who have played here and had success and then left, when
we go on the road they all want to talk to Rudy,'' Alicea said.
``When we were in Cleveland, Segui was saying, ``Ohhh, I need to go
see Rudy.' He can't do anything for them now because they're in
other organizations, but they miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo teaches his hitters five basic points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see the ball, you have to have rhythm and timing,
you've got to separate (the trigger mechanism from the swing), you
have to stay square (to the plate) and you have to transfer your
weight,'' Jaramillo said. ``We feed off those five roots. That's
what simplifies it for the hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he the best hitting coach in the game? It's a question the
former Dallas Sunset and University of Texas star outfielder meets
in his typical head-on style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good hitting coaches,'' he said, ``but I
don't doubt myself in any way. I want to be the best. I strive to
be the best and that's the same attitude I try to give my
players.''
</P>
<P>
   For Oates, it's an easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he the best? In my mind he is because I hired him,'' Oates
said, ``and the results speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates might, in fact, want to visit that same hotel restaurant
next to The Ballpark and drop a little more tip money on the table.
</P>
<P>
   It was, without a doubt, the best breakfast-turned-into-lunch he
has ever had. nn

PRESIDENT RAISES BIG BUCKS FOR LIBRARY, HILLARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Bill Clinton swept into Los Angeles on Friday to
kick off the Democratic National Convention with a celebration of
his eight years as president and to do what he does best - raise
money and campaign for votes.
</P>
<P>
   The first stop for Clinton was at a fund-raiser for the
re-election campaign of Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, where
aides estimated more than $100,000 was collected for the Nov. 7
race even as the congressman is planning to run for Los Angeles
mayor next April.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also championed Vice President Al Gore as an experienced
and worthy successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked closer with Al Gore than anyone,'' Clinton said.
``I know this man. He is willing to make the tough decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarred by bitter partisanship during his presidency, Clinton
urged both Democrats and Republicans to take the high road in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that they are honorable people and treat them
that way. We have to put an end to the politics of personal
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean we can't have an honest debate on our
differences. The other side doesn't want that. They say it's
negative campaigning when we talk about how they voted in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of delegates from across the country due to
arrive today for the start of the convention on Monday, the big
events for Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton, a New York
Senate candidate, are scheduled throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An event at the home of entertainer Barbra Streisand - at
$100,000 a couple, minimum - is expected to raise some $10 million
for the Bill Clinton Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   A second event is expected to raise between $2.5 million and $4
million for first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the U.S.
Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles and this state have been very kind to me and mine
and my administration,'' Clinton said at one point. Also, jokingly,
he noted: ``California has two women Senators. I think New York
should have at least one.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the president's fund-raising during the convention
has raised some concerns among other Democrats about whether he was
taking so much that Vice President Al Gore will be left
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Party chairman Art Torres said he was not
surprised at what Clinton was doing and understood the reasons for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his last convention and is his only opportunity to
raise the money he needs for his library,'' Torres said. ``Former
President Bush did the same thing. It's what presidents do.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Torres said, California already has been generous with
Gore and will continue to support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in praise of Gore, as he has in the past, Clinton said
the vice president provided his full backing during difficult
times, such as deciding whether to make loans to Mexico and whether
to get American troops involved in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And the president credited Gore with helping him to guide
economic prosperity that has flourished under his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we had this sustained level of economic
prosperity was 1960-1961,'' Clinton said. ``Everyone thought we
were on automatic pilot. Well, we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Republicans, the nation underwent the worst recession
since the Great Depression, he said, as he criticized proposals to
use all of a national projected surplus for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he told the crowd of 400 at the buffet reception for
Becerra, other factors were involved.
</P>
<P>
   If he had a Democratic-controlled Congress, Clinton said he
could have pushed through stronger Social Security protections, a
patient's bill of rights, prescription drug benefits and stronger
gun control laws.

ANAHEIM'S LEFT-HANDERS DEAL HERNANDEZ DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was 1998 and the worst start of Orlando
Hernandez's career. It also could have been the best thing that
happened to him. Their lineup stocked with left-handed hitters, the
Anaheim Angels peppered El Duque for 13 hits and 10 runs in 3 1/3
innings here two years ago, incontrovertible evidence that
Hernandez had to change his approach and pitch inside more.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque is having more trouble with left-handed batters lately,
a problem illuminated once more by the Angels, who thumped the
Yankees by 8-3 Friday night. Mo Vaughn and Garret Anderson each had
two-run doubles for Anaheim, and the Yankees' lead over the Boston
Red Sox in the American League East was trimmed to four games.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it seems Hernandez has been unable to pitch inside to
left-handers, rather than unwilling. He threw 71 pitches to
left-handers in the first five innings, and not once did any of the
Anaheim lefties swing and miss. Hernandez (8-9) allowed nine hits
and seven runs in 6 1/3 innings, and he has replaced David Cone as
the Yankees' most notable pitching puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has always been more effective against right-handed
batters than lefties because he can entice right-handers to flail
at his slider. But his slider is not nearly as dangerous against
left-handers, and Hernandez has had to find other ways to finish
them off.
</P>
<P>
   After learning a lesson here two years ago, he starting jamming
lefties with fastballs, mixing them up with changeups and slow
curveballs. Lately, however, Hernandez has struggled to control his
fastball and his changeup when throwing to lefties, and has been
getting knocked around.
</P>
<P>
   When Seattle beat El Duque last weekend, left-handed batters
reached base in 6 of 14 plate appearances; Friday night, lefties
reached base in 10 of their first 18 plate appearances, a .556
on-base percentage. The Angels scored four runs in the first inning
against Hernandez, on a single by Darin Erstad, a walk issued to
Orlando Palmeiro, Vaughn's two-run double, and run-scoring hits by
Garret Anderson and Adam Kennedy _ all left-handed batters. Two
right-handed batters hit in the inning; Tim Salmon and Troy Glaus
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   When the half-inning finally ended, after 30 pitches, catcher
Jorge Posada got a quick lecture from manager Joe Torre and
Hernandez rested on the bench, a white towel draped around his
neck, looking like a boxer at the end of a brutal first round.
Billy Connors, the Yankees' interim pitching coach, played the role
of trainer, standing directly before Hernandez, placing his hands
lightly on each of Hernandez's legs, speaking to his pitcher.
Hernandez sometimes glanced at Connors, but mostly looked away,
frustrated. He pitched inside more often to left-handed batters
thereafter, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees appeared on the verge of a comeback several times
against Scott Schoeneweis, the Anaheim starter. But they stranded
two runners in the second inning and scored one run and left
another runner in scoring position in the third. Glenallen Hill
rocketed a ball to right-center in the fourth, with a runner at
first, and the ball disappeared into the stands. But Mike Reilly,
the first-base umpire, immediately signaled fan interference,
ruling that an Edison Field patron had reached out from the
grandstand, over the playing field, and pulled Hill's drive into
the stands; the replay showed his call was correct.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had runners on second and third with nobody out.
First baseman Tino Martinez took a called third strike, turned and
argued with the home plate umpire Laz Diaz, who had a number of
exchanges with hitters from both teams. Scott Brosius took a called
third strike, and he turned and gawked at Diaz incredulously. When
Luis Sojo lined out to end a rally that resulted in no runs,
Brosius flung a cup of water and took an angry swipe at a cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams bashed a two-run homer the next inning, cutting
the Anaheim lead to 4-3. The Angels' left-handed batters responded
in the bottom of the fifth: Erstad reached out and poked a looping
double inside the left-field line, and Vaughn walked with one out.
After a fielder's choice groundout, Hernandez got ahead on the
count to Anderson, no balls and two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Needing one pitch to stifle the Angels' rally, Hernandez tried
nicking the outside corner with a breaking ball, but when it
drifted over the plate, Anderson reached out to pull a line drive
to right-center field. As Vaughn rounded third, he waved an arm,
beckoning Salmon to follow, both scoring easily to give Anaheim a
6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees threatened in the seventh. After Williams singled
with two out, pushing Posada to second base, the right-hander Mike
Fhyrie came in to pitch and worked carefully to the right-handed
Jose Canseco, walking the slugger on four pitches. The bases were
loaded, but Fhyrie got out of the inning when Hill flied to right.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad collected his third hit of the game, his 180th hit of the
season, in leading off the seventh with a single. The left-hander
Randy Choate relieved Hernandez with one out to pitch to Vaughn,
and Erstad _ apparently attuned to a scouting report on the rookie
_ stole second and third and scored on a sacrifice fly.

NOTHING DIFFICULT ABOUT SPARKS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The WNBA playoffs are supposed to be tough, but the
Los Angeles Sparks made it look way too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Focused and prepared for a battle, the Sparks did themselves a
favor, first, by jumping out to a big lead over the Phoenix Mercury
to take the fans out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in front of the Mercury's franchise-low crowd of 6,167
they put on a clinic to take an overwhelming 86-71 victory Friday
night at America West Arena in the opening game of the
best-of-three, first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally focused and prepared to play,'' said Sparks
center Lisa Leslie, who hit 8 of 15 for 20 points to go with 11
rebounds. ``It all started at practice yesterday. The game was won
at practice. Practice was harder than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was hard for the Mercury, which had no answer for
Leslie or DeLisha Milton, who had 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting, or
Mwadi Mabika, who had 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting. Tamecka Dixon
added to the balanced attack with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 52 percent and outrebounded the Mercury 38-26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is good ball movement on our part,'' Sparks coach
Michael Cooper said. ``We're a very unselfish team, a team that
loves to pass. It's not about who gets it done as long as it gets
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks led 24-12 midway through the first half and never let
Phoenix get any closer than 11. Each time the Mercury tried to go
on a run, the Sparks kept pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Edwards hit a 5-foot jumper and Brandy Reed pulled up for
a 3-pointer to cut the Mercury's deficit to 51-40 with 12:50 to
play. But the Sparks bounced back with Ukari Figgs, Leslie and
Mabika scoring the next six points to rebuild the solid lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a re-adjustment on our part. That's when you can't
make the mental errors that we were making, and I'm glad we were
able to regroup from that,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was limited to 36 percent from the field to trail at
halftime, 43-24. They finished at 46 percent, but much of their
offense came in garbage time when the game was already decided.
They were 6 of 21 from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Sparks' fourth win over the Mercury and their third
consecutive in Phoenix. It was the Mercury's worst effort against
the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't shoot the ball well in the first half,'' Phoenix
coach Cheryl Miller said. ``When you play a team like L.A. you
can't afford to get in a hole that deep. L.A. made some key shots,
got the key rebounds and they played extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   The series moves to Los Angeles where Game 2 is Sunday at 2:30
p.m. and Game 3 Tuesday, if necessary. It will be the Sparks first
game in the Forum since July 27. They've been on the road for the
last seven games, going 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper warned that going home is not a guaranteed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take for granted that we're going to go back there
and automatically get a win,'' he said. ``We're going to have to
work at it. Even though they lost, the format the way it's set up,
they were looking to steal this one. Well, they have two games to
get back in this one. We can't play around with this team. Even
though we're going home we know the urgency of the situation. We
have to put this team away, and hopefully we can do it Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix got balanced scoring, with Reed leading with 17 points,
Bridgett Pettis contributing 14 off the bench, Michelle Griffiths
adding 13, and Lisa Harrison and Jennifer Gillom getting 10 apiece.

   Davis sets American record in 200 freestyle
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Josh Davis was a 15-year-old student at San
Antonio's Churchill High School in 1988 when the U.S. Olympic
Swimming Trials were held at the University of Texas. Already
thinking swimming would be his sport, he went to the trials with
his mother and saw his destiny when Matt Biondi set an American
record in the 200-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I got my Matt Biondi tapes,'' he said. ``I watched
them about every day. Then when I got to college in 1990, I lost
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimming the same event Friday at the 2000 Trials, Davis starred
in his own short film, four adrenaline-fueled laps of the Indiana
University-Purdue University pool that toppled the record Biondi
set 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a 1994 UT graduate, touched in 1 minute, 47.26 seconds,
besting Biondi's mark of 1:47.72, to win an event that had the feel
of a Longhorns workout. Scott Goldblatt, who is entering his senior
year at Texas, took second, ensuring he will compete in Sydney.
Jamie Rauch and Nate Dusing, both of whom also are due to be UT
seniors this year, were fifth and sixth, respectively, finishes
that likely will lead to relay positions on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be disappointed,'' said Rauch, a graduate of Cy
Creek High School. ``Josh and Scott go one-two, and Nate and I make
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only the top four finishers in the 200 freestyle are
guaranteed spots on the team, the fifth-and sixth-place finishers
typically make it as a result of swimmers doubling in various
events.
</P>
<P>
   Two other events Friday added to the UT presence on the U.S.
team. Winning the women's 100-meter backstroke was Texas ex B.J.
Bedford. Earning second in the men's 100-meter backstroke was Neil
Walker, a 1998 UT graduate. Walker finished behind Lenny
Krayzelburg, who won in 53.84, off his 1999 world-record time of
53.60.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, the evening capped a remarkable series of months. He
has been gunning for the record in the 200 freestyle since winning
the event at the 2000 spring nationals in 1:47.94, making him the
first American to go under 1:48 since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it when it counts,'' he said of his record. ``Not the
preliminaries in the morning. I did it at night, making the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks away from his 28th birthday, he has
clearly found a gear he didn't have four years ago, when he won
three relay gold medals in Atlanta but finished seventh in the 200
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Davis, one reason for his improvement is the fact
he has been training in Austin with Randy Reese, former coach at
the University of Florida and the brother of UT men's coach Eddie
Reese, an arrangement, he said, that allows him to ``get the best
of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Davis had something extra Friday, going out
fast and holding on at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit 100 (meters), heard the crowd going crazy and figured I
was on record pace,'' he said. ``To break Biondi's record by half a
second, I'm really happy and thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauch said it helped that he and the other UT swimmers in the
200 finals had trained with Davis and become accustomed to his
breakneck early pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been swimming with Josh long enough to know that's how he
does things,'' Rauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he believes he can swim at least 1:46.80 and possibly
get within shouting distance of Australia's Ian Thorpe, who in May
lowered the world record to 1:45.51.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to spend the next two weeks working on fitness,''
Davis said. ``I know I can go out. Now I've got to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   He also will have to deal with Olympic preparation at a time
when his wife, Shantel, is expecting their third child _ a boy _
adding to a household that already includes Caleb, soon to turn 3,
and Abigail, 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three kids in three years _ that provides me with a lot of
motivation,'' he said. ``A lot of diapers to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he and his wife are planning to induce labor on Sept.
4, the day after U.S. swimmers are scheduled to leave for Sydney
from their training base in Los Angeles. He said he will return to
Austin for the delivery, then travel to Sydney himself a day later.
</P>
<P>
   After welcoming his son into the world, he said, he will be able
to swim ``with peace of mind'' and make his attempt to challenge
Thorpe on Thorpe's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Australians, we've really got our work cut out for
us,'' Davis said. ``But I race to win. That's why there's an
Olympic final. Maybe I can get 1:46, and you never know at that
level. Anything can happen.''

   Berkman, Astros rally past Phillies
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Some things are better left unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, manager Larry Dierker expected the Astros to hit
Phillies starter Bruce Chen on Friday night, but not hard-throwing
reliever Vicente Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Dierker had it backward.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman had four RBIs, including a bases-clearing double
in a five-run ninth inning, as the Astros rallied to defeat the
Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 in a game between the teams with the
worst records in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After being held to a run off Chen over the first seven innings,
the Astros finally put together some offense with one run in the
eighth and five in the ninth against the Phillies' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman did most of the damage with a run-scoring double to tie
the game at 2 in the eighth and a three-run double in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou went 3-for-5, which included his 18th home run of
the season, and Julio Lugo had two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is such an unusual game in the sense that what you
expect might happen sometimes doesn't happen,'' said Dierker, whose
club won for only the fifth time this season when trailing after
seven innings. ``I expected we would start hitting Chen. It didn't
seem he was throwing that hard or he had that great of control. But
we never really did hit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Padilla comes in throwing 96 mph, and he looks
unhittable, and we whack him all over the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can start by thanking Phillies manager Terry
Francona, who replaced Chen with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, acquired from the Atlanta Braves at the All-Star break,
allowed two runs and six hits in 7 innings. He walked four and
struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   No member of the Astros' active roster ever had faced Chen prior
to Friday's game at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, who stifled the Astros in two relief outings in early
July while with the Arizona Diamondbacks, inherited one baserunner
and promptly ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Alou singled, and Berkman followed with an RBI double into the
left-center gap.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Spiers was intentionally walked, Padilla got out of
the jam when Tony Eusebio bounced into a double play to end the
inning with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward led off the Astros ninth with a pinch-hit single off
Padilla, then was removed for pinch runner Glen Barker. Lugo beat
out an infield chopper to second base, and Tim Bogar reached safely
on an error by Padilla to load the bases. Jeff Bagwell was hit on
the left shoulder on a full-count pitch to put the Astros ahead 3-2
with no outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of an ugly inning,'' Bagwell said. ``It doesn't
matter how the runs come.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla (2-3), who left the game with cramping in his left side,
allowed four runs, all unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes replaced Padilla and recorded two outs before
Berkman added the final touches with RBI Nos. 51, 52 and 53 of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about getting into a comfort zone in big situations
when you've got guys in scoring position and know you are one of
the people the team is counting on to drive in some runs,'' said
Berkman, who batted in the No. 6 hole Friday. ``Chen was tough.
Whenever you face a pitcher like that, you have to hang around and
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Phillies struggled out of the bullpen, Astros reliever
Marc Valdes (3-4) pitched two shutout innings, and closer Octavio
Dotel retired the final three batters.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Scott Elarton allowed two runs and seven hits in
six innings. He struck out a season-high nine and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-7 righthander said he never felt comfortable with his
delivery Friday night, which led to a high pitch count (119 in six
innings) and an early departure.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies stranded five runners in the first three innings,
including three in the third when Mike Lieberthal struck out and
Travis Lee bounced out to Elarton to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrible in the windup,'' said Elarton, who had won
eight of his previous nine starts. ``It seemed like I started every
inning with a runner on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness I felt good from the stretch, because I was
able to pitch out of some jams and keep the damage to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``He didn't have his best stuff, but he proved
what kind of pitcher he's becoming by keeping us in the game. The
bullpen came in and did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on Kevin Jordan's
third homer of the season, a shot just into the left-field
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the game at 1 in the sixth on Alou's homer, but
the Phillies quickly regained the lead in the bottom half of the
inning on an RBI groundout by Tomas Perez. Pat Burrell led off the
inning with a walk and moved to third on a double by Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio extended his career-high 15-game hitting streak _
the longest in Astros history by a catcher _ with a double in the
fifth.

   Happy days are here again for Pickens
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Receiver Carl Pickens has been spending a lot
of time on his knees lately.
</P>
<P>
   But Pickens isn't begging. He's just thanking the Lord for his
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   After escaping Cincinnati and signing with Tennessee, Pickens
feels like a political prisoner who has been granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens, who grew up in North Carolina, played at the University
of Tennessee and owns a home in Atlanta, left a loser and signed
with a Super Bowl contender desperate for a receiver with his
impressive credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living proof that the grass can be greener,'' Pickens said
Friday during a break at the Titans' training camp. ``There's just
no comparison between them (the organizations). I really feel like
I've been reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   During his eight-year career with the Bengals, Pickens never
played on a team with a winning record. The best they could do was
7-9. The Titans haven't had a losing season since 1995 when they
were still the Houston Oilers, and they are coming off a Super Bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I've ever been more excited about a season,
except for maybe my rookie year,'' Pickens said. ``People say,
`Have you changed?' and I say, `No, I haven't changed, because who
I was in Cincinnati is not who I really am.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so fired up here, because everything's so positive. They
know what it takes to win. How could you not be fired up to be in
this situation?''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual. The Bengals are fired up about getting
rid of Pickens and called it addition by subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   At times during his career in Cincinnati, Pickens was as good as
any receiver in the NFL not named Jerry Rice. Along the way,
though, Pickens earned a reputation as a malcontent, a troublemaker
who was a bad influence on the plethora of young players the
Bengals kept bringing in every year. They couldn't wait to get rid
of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like losing,'' Pickens said. ``There were times when
I said what was on my mind because we were losing. I just couldn't
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got criticized for being a cancer on the team. The media
said I was hard to deal with and uncoachable. But I don't know if
you ever heard anything about me not playing on Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   During a three-year stretch, Pickens was phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   After catching 71 passes for 1,127 yards and 11 touchdowns in
1994, he had 99 receptions for 1,234 yards and 17 touchdowns in
1995. The next season, Pickens caught 100 passes for 1,180 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Carl brings his `A' game, he's pretty much unstoppable,''
Titans cornerback Denard Walker said. ``If he's not the premier guy
in our conference, he's right up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of Cincinnati was a two-year process for Pickens,
who had been designated as the Bengals' franchise player. When he
blasted coach Bruce Coslet near the end of last season and said it
would be a mistake to bring him back, Pickens became persona non
grata with management.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Bengals owner Mike Brown inserted a clause in
contracts demanding a portion of signing bonuses be repaid if a
player is critical of the team. Some players signed it. Others
didn't. The NFL Players Association has filed a grievance trying to
get the clause _ dubbed the Pickens rule by the media and players _
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the offseason, the Bengals told Pickens to clean out his
locker, that he wouldn't be returning. But they had to get a ruling
on the franchise designation and how it would be interpreted after
Pickens was gone. When the league didn't get back to them quickly
enough, they told Pickens to report. He languished in football
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't figure it out,'' he said. ``It's like they
didn't want Pickens in camp because he's the cancer of the team. I
was actually heading out the door on my way to minicamp, and they
said, `We don't want you in camp.' I'm thinking, `Cool, I'm going
to be released.' Then they said, `No, now we want you to come to
camp now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like, `Make up your mind. Either I'm the cancer of the
team or you want me to come to camp.' You hear about other teams
wanting you, and they wouldn't trade me. They had opportunities to
get draft picks for me and didn't do it. I felt like they were just
stringing me out, trying to make me suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time came to let me go, probably in hopes of me not
finding a job anywhere else, they didn't do it. I guess they
assumed my reputation would keep teams away from me. But Tennessee
wasn't concerned. Neither were the Jets, Ravens and Saints. But it
worked out for the best. It strengthened me.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his reputation, Pickens figured it was the media's
doing because his coaches and teammates didn't call him a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that was fed to them by anybody on the staff,
because the staff still wanted me to play,'' he said. ``They paid
me a lot of money to play. Why would you pay a guy all this money
if he was a cancer and a problem in the locker room and his
teammates and coaches don't like him? I couldn't really figure it
all out and who was saying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing that bothered me, that nobody stepped up and
said, `Hey, he's not like that. He's here every day, and he's
working his butt off.' You just never heard any of that from
anybody. I had to defend myself all the time. There were 10 or 15
other guys who felt the same way I did, because I talked with them
about it. But you never heard about it from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens is having to get into shape, but he caught a touchdown
pass in the preseason-opening victory over Kansas City. Titans
coach Jeff Fisher envisions Pickens and Kevin Dyson as the
starters. When Yancey Thigpen recovers from ankle surgery,
Tennessee could have an outstanding trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Yancey's healthy, we'll play the best two,'' Fisher said.
``It's understood by all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens, 30, has impressed his teammates, especially the
defensive backs who are relieved they only have to cover him in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickens is smart,'' cornerback Samari Rolle said. ``He changes
his routes. He's a big target, easy to find. He wants the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teams pursued Pickens, who signed as a free agent after
he was waived. After playing at the University of Tennessee, he
found it hard to believe the Titans had captured the interest of
football fans in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really surprised,'' he said. ``To be honest with you, I
didn't know how well the Titans would go over in Tennessee, because
this is Tennessee Volunteer country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everywhere this side of Nashville and that side of
Nashville, it's Titans this and Titans that. You see the signs,
posters, billboards, the television stuff. Some people say because
it's new it'll wear off, but I don't see it changing as long as
this team continues to win. And I think we will continue to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a sense of direction here. We have leadership. We have
the facilities, the fan base. It's like playing on an all-star
team, because you've got guys at every position who can make big
plays. I love it here because the only thing you have to worry
about is football. Everything else is taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens has circled Oct. 8 on his calendar. That's when the
Titans travel to Cincinnati to play in the new Paul Brown Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it'll be interesting,'' he said, choosing his words
carefully for the first time. ``That's a team that let me go and
didn't get anything for me. I spent eight years there, and I still
have a lot of good friends in Cincinnati. I don't hate Cincinnati
or management there. We just had to go our separate ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens believes he has just signed the proverbial new lease on
his football life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be in a positive, winning situation,'' he
said. ``For now, I'm just happy to be out of Cincinnati. I get a
chance to play on a winning team with a chance to go to the Super
Bowl.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels left-hander Scott Schoeneweis
wormed his way in and out of trouble Friday night at Edison Field,
a tease here and there, and, in the end, he thoroughly frustrated
the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Schoeneweis emerged with an 8-3 win in front of
43,169 fans, the third-largest home crowd of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It was Schoeneweis' first win in more than two months and it
provided the Angels with just their third win in nine games while
stopping the Yankees' winning streak at three.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very fine offensive ballclub,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said of the Yankees. ``Scott kept them off balance all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Garret Anderson drove in three of the Angels'
runs with a pair of doubles, first baseman Mo Vaughn knocked in two
with a double and Troy Glaus slugged his 32nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one of Glaus' homers have come while playing third base,
which established a club record for homers by a third baseman,
breaking Doug DeCinces' 1982 mark.
</P>
<P>
   One downside to the win: Tim Salmon's hitting streak was halted
at 17 games. The Angels right fielder was 0 for 4, striking out
twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels ripped into Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (8-9) for
four first-inning runs, added two more in the fifth, stole one,
literally, in the seventh, then finished it with Glaus' homer in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis (6-6) hadn't won since beating Minnesota on May 25.
Since then he'd lost four, had three no-decisions and made an
appearance on the disabled list.

   ``I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a lot of frustration,'' he
said. ``I'd throw well, but we'd fall behind. I felt I was putting
us in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis pitched into the seventh, scattering nine hits over
6 innings. But he turned over yet another a precarious situation to
reliever Mike Fuyrie: two on, two out and designated hitter Jose
Canseco digging in at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Fuyrie walked Canseco on four pitches to load the bases. But he
got Hill on a fly to right for the third out . . . and the Yanks
left three more on base.
</P>
<P>
   Fuyrie came out after that, and following the game he was placed
on the disabled list because of inflammation of his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   In one other move, the Angels outrighted outfielder Chris
Hatcher _ who never got into a game in his brief stay in Anaheim _
to Triple-A Edmonton to make room on the roster for Kent Mercker,
tonight's starter.

MARINERS GO SEVEN GAMES UP FOR FIRST TIME AS ABBOTT MUFFLES
INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Turn to the standings page Saturday and you'll see an
astonishing sight, even if this fine family newspaper isn't running
that infamous ``Son of the Beach'' ad for ``Bodacious Ha-Has.''
</P>
<P>
   No, this is a simple line of small, sans serif type showing
something truly historic: the Mariners with a seven-game lead. Like
the headline, ``Starbucks drastically lowers prices on its
lattes,'' this is something that has never before been printed in a
Seattle newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After a 6-2 road trip against the American League's two other
first-place teams, the Mariners returned to a sold-out Safeco Field
Friday night and extended their first-place lead to a
franchise-high seven games _ a full week's worth of games _ with a
7-1 victory over Cleveland. The lead surpasses Seattle's previous
largest, 6{ games during the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's too early to get too excited. After all, as
manager Lou Piniella cautioned reporters, ``It's August 11 _
there's still a lot of season left to play.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, there's a lot of season left to play what,
alas, has become the Mariners' theme song, ``Who Let the Dogs
Out?'' Asked what the over-under is for how many times fans will
hear the song (which is a charitable term) between now and season's
end, pitcher Paul Abbott said, ``I don't know, 1,050 times?''
</P>
<P>
   As often as the Mariners play it, that's probably too low an
estimate for the rest of the weekend, let alone the rest of the
season. But it was about the only time Abbott was off Friday.
Continuing his strong work as a starter, Abbott held one of the
league's best lineups to one run and four hits in 7 2/3 innings,
running his record to 8-4 with a 3.80 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that just a mere week ago the Mariners' lead was
down to one thin game, with three more games against the Yankees
and four against the White Sox staring at them. Rather than fold,
Seattle won six of those games and carried over that success into
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep go out there and play like it's a one-game
lead, like we did last week,'' Abbott said, adding that playing New
York and Chicago ``was a great chance to show we're one of the
teams to be reckoned with. It's a huge confidence builder. That was
huge for us, to go in there and send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but gain confidence from a trip like that,''
said John Olerud, who continued his pursuit of Cal Ripken's record
streak (he's only about 16 years away) when he had to replace an
injured Stan Javier at first base on what was supposed to be his
first night off this season. ``To play the division leaders and go
6-2, that's a big shot in the arm for everybody. Now you feel that
if and when you make it to the playoffs, you have had success
against those teams. And that definitely helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facing a lineup like that and a pitcher as good as Chuck
Finley, we feel like if we can score a few runs, we've got a chance
to win the way we've been pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much what happened, too. After Cleveland scored
its only run against Abbott in the top of the first inning, the
Mariners tied it with a run in the bottom of the inning and took
the lead with three in the second. Finley, who caught his cleat and
turned his right ankle on his first pitch, allowed five runs and
walked six in 31/3 innings. And that was pretty much that, thanks
to Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   One start after pitching a career-high eight innings against the
Yankees, Abbott held Cleveland to one hit and no runs after the
first inning. With a stiff breeze blowing in most of the evening,
Abbott retired 21 of 23 batters during one stretch before walking
consecutive batters with two out in the eighth and giving way to
reliever Jose Paniagua. Abbott, who pitched briefly for Cleveland
another lifetime ago, is 4-0 with a 0.81 ERA against his ex-team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win,'' said Abbott. ``And when you expect to win
and then do it, it makes everyone contribute and feel confident.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, things have changed a bit since these two teams
last played.
</P>
<P>
   Decimated by injuries during the first half of the season,
Cleveland has been rallying lately, trimming three games off
Chicago's Central Division lead since the start of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a comment that the White Sox could probably hear
Cleveland's footsteps approaching, Piniella replied, ``I hope they
don't hear them too much. Because we're playing them the next six
of nine games. We want to keep them nice and quiet ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just playing good solid baseball, a combination of good
hitting and good pitching,'' Piniella said. ``And that translates
into wins. We just have to keep going out there and do it one game
at a time.''

   There are now official surveys to confirm that tourists are
taking over New York City.
</P>
<P>
   With a population approaching 9 million, the city played host to
about four tourists per resident last year, according to federal
surveys and tourist research announced by city officials last week.
The figures pushed New York up into second place for tourist
destinations in the United States, bested only by Orlando, Fla.,
home of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Most of New York City's 36.7 million visitors came from within
the United States, but foreigners made up about 20 percent of the
total. Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan and France had the honor of
providing the largest numbers of New York City's 6.6 million
international visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they know where to go? What do they expect of the
strange and fearsome New Yorker? What is considered surprising and
noteworthy?
</P>
<P>
   The questions are all the more interesting because the answers,
as found in excerpts from foreign guidebooks, reveal as much about
the culture the travelers are coming from as the one they intend to
gawk at.
</P>
<P>
   And they also demonstrate, as many New Yorkers can testify, that
no one has warned tourists not to come to a dead stop on Times
Square's sidewalks at rush hour.

</P>
<P>
   AT THE MOVIES: As the film starts, the audience gets absorbed
immediately. Although you are not allowed to make noise in the
cinema, some people shout and cry. Literally, it is breathless
movie-watching. If you are watching action film, there will be a
storm of applause and cheers at victorious scenes. This noise isn't
unpleasant but heightens excitement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON SUNDAY: You see a lot of people sitting inside cafes and on
benches on the street, reading weighty The New York Times Sunday
edition, holding a cup of coffee in their hand.... People don't
read everything carried in there but only those sections that are
necessary to them, which is the New York style. Apart from reading
materials, in terms of information gathering, it is useful for even
those travellers who are not good at English. Even if you can't
read it, you will be in a jolly good mood just to open its pages
and look at it. It's a bit heavy to take back to Japan but it may
make a good souvenir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S OK IN HARLEM: There are frequent muggings and violence in
back streets. It is said drug transactions take place in abandoned
buildings, and drug addicts reportedly won't hesitate to kill
others in order to get $50. . . . New Yorkers dislike to venture
into such areas, and tourists should stay away from them. In fact,
the atmosphere changes drastically when you go off the main street.
Taxis, too, don't want to go into narrow streets. For some reason,
there are a lot of people in restricted buildings. Is it meaningful
to visit such areas for sightseeing? It is OK to go to church to
listen to gospel or visit a jazz club, but you shouldn't go to
observe poor people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON DENTAL VALUES: It depends on the kind of treatment and skills
of the doctor, but perhaps it may be cheaper to buy a return air
ticket and come back to Japan for treatment. However, it is true
that dental treatment in the U.S. is far advanced compared to that
in Japan. It could be said that once you have dental treatment
there, that tooth wouldn't require any more treatment for the rest
of your life. Also, treatment is completed within 4 to 5 days [in
Japan, it takes a few weeks to fill a cavity), so maybe it is a
good idea to make it an opportunity to expose yourself to American
dental treatment. It is up to you to decide which is inexpensive.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   From ``CityPack _ New York,'' Chinese-language edition,
published by Joint Publishing Ltd., Hong Kong, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   STREET MANNERS: Don't talk to the crazy people on the street,
even though they may seem fun to be with. . . . New York women are
very straightforward and can adapt well on the streets. So if
someone harasses you, be like New York ladies: speak your mind and
tell the person to blow off.
</P>
<P>
   Germany
</P>
<P>
   From ``Marco Polo _ New York,'' published by Mairs
Geographischer Verlag, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   RULES: Do not go to the park alone at night. And never carry
more than $50 in cash. Do not shop spontaneously. Shops on Fifth
Avenue which advertise ``going out of business'' sales are rarely
on the verge of actually closing. Do not eat from salad bars. They
are popular in delicatessens and self-service restaurants, but the
health commission warns that these unpackaged foods can make one
ill. . . . Do not count on seeing celebrities in restaurants which
have photos of famous people on the wall. The chances of seeing
Woody Allen or Madonna during a walk in Central Park or running
into Kevin Bacon or Demi Moore while shopping on Columbus Avenue
are greater. . . . Do not underestimate bicyclists. Always look
right and left even before crossing a one-way street, as bike
riders often speed in the opposite direction. Do not travel in
``gypsy cabs.'' New Yorkers do, but they also know how to negotiate
the right prices.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Goldstadt Fuehrer _ New York,'' published by
Goldstadtverlag, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   VALUABLES: When in a hotel room, always put the chain on the
door. Don't leave your key at reception. If a thief enters your
room, act as if you are sleeping. Call for help only after he has
left. . . . Don't visit deserted places like Central Park or the
Bowery at night. Don't ride elevators or enter subway stations
alone. Don't let your bags be carried by the mostly young men at
Penn or Grand Central Station as they will often disappear.
</P>
<P>
   THE COLOR OF MONEY: Be careful! Paper money is easy to confuse.
All bank notes are green and the same size. What makes them
different is the former president who appears on the front.

</P>
<P>
   LOGIC DEFIED: In theory, it should be easy to get in and out of
the city. But the traffic becomes unbearable at times, resulting in
traffic jams. Moreover, winter frosts sometimes eat through the
asphalt, creating large and dangerous holes. In the spring, the
yellow taxicabs race through those holes tilted to a side.
</P>
<P>
   CHINATOWN REALITY: The streets are always full of people,
everything is incredibly dirty, the facades scream with tasteless
bright neons. Yes, on one hand this place does stink, but on the
other hand it emanates spirituality. One thing is sure: it does not
try to pretend anything.

</P>
<P>
   EAVESDROPPING: Keep your ears pricked at all times and you will
be as entertained as much by what you hear as by what you see.
Behind the gruff exteriors, Manhattanites are a wistful,
open-hearted lot, and, perhaps because over 40 per cent are
immigrants, they have a knack of muscling newcomers into instant
conversations which can culminate in lifelong friendships.

<P>
   From ``New York City: The Rough Guide,'' by Martin Dunford and
Jack Holland.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBIES' COUSINS: The New York City Police _ the N.Y.P.D., a k a
``New York's Finest'' _ are for the most part approachable, helpful
and overworked. This means that asking directions gets a friendly
response, reporting a theft a weary ``Whaddya want me to do about
it'' _ and any smile is greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   MOOD: A sense of nervy self-preservation is rife here. People
make studied efforts to avoid eye contact, and any unusual
behaviour clears a space immediately: the atmosphere of impending
violence is sometimes sniffable. . .
</P>
<P>
   New York's tension doesn't automatically mean violence; it's
largely due to the frenetic pace at which most of the city
operates. Take several million people, pump them full of caffeine,
make them believe that they have to get where they're going five
minutes faster than is actually possible, and pack them onto a tiny
island _ there's bound to be an edge in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ... Few people seem to have time for anything not on their
mental schedule. Even asking for directions on the street is best
done with an awareness of this, ideally while moving at the same
pace and in the same direction of the informant.
</P>
<P>
   From ``New York City (Condensed),'' published by Lonely Planet.
</P>
<P>
   EXTREMES: Dense, immense, intense _ there is no other place with
as much upfront allure. The bagels have the most cream cheese, the
panhandlers have the best stories, you can take your dog to church,
you can pray to Mecca (or Wiccan) in the street, sell lobster
bisque from a hot-dog stand and no one will bat an eyelid. &QL;

<P>
   PACE: Watch out, New Yorkers despise those who are on the slow
track. To take a break for them is a waste of time. One has to go
faster and faster.
</P>
<P>
   ONE CROWDED PARK: New Yorkers are crazy about sports: gym, body
building, jogging. They work out early in the morning or after
work. On Sundays, they all meet at Central Park where they jog,
bike or roller-blade.
</P>
<P>
   TAXI DRIVERS: Curiously, New York taxi drivers hardly speak
American, or even English. At least, not the same English as you
do. They are foreigners from Asia or Haiti. They are very nice and
don't mind driving you only a few blocks! A dream for the
Parisians, used to the arrogance of local drivers. Yet, their way
of driving is harsh; they might slam on the brakes and suddenly
speed up, insult other drivers. This is a part of the city's
climate.
</P>
<P>
   HEDONISM: Alcohol is still taboo in the U.S. American society,
very puritan and conservative, allows the free sale of arms but has
outrageous regulations for anything related to taboo pleasures
(sex, marijuana, alcohol and even some rock CDs, considered too
subversive). . . . You can buy a Kalaschnikov without any special
license, yet you will have to show your passport while buying a
simple beer. You should never go out without your passport, as some
bars may request it. They are crazy, these Americans.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE: Americans drink all the time _ Coca-cola, Seven-up, Dr
Pepper, Fresca, Tab and other soft drinks. Thus, in many places you
can get as many refills of soda as you want. If you want to avoid
drinking what is called regular or American coffee, which tastes
like dishwater, buy some Nescafe and add it in.
</P>
<P>
   CULINARY MATTERS: To say that an average American has bad eating
habits and eats too much is at the same time true and too easy.
Every region has its particularity: organic and vegetarian cusine
in California; cosmopolitan and diverse in New York. . . .
Americans are rather partial to food. You will be struck by the

   STYLE IN MOTION: Walking is important to New Yorkers. Numerous
office workers, at exactly 5 o'clock, will walk out of their
buildings, quickly taking off their dress shoes and putting on
sneakers for their long treks to the subway or buses. Like in the
Woody Allen movies (a New Yorker to the extreme), people are
constantly walking, not just for exercise, but to relieve stress
and to socialize. ``Will you come with me?'' is a common question
that usually ends up in a 20-, 30- or 50-block walk.

</P>
<P>
   LOGIC DEFIED: In theory, it should be easy to get in and out of
the city. But the traffic becomes unbearable at times, resulting in
traffic jams. Moreover, winter frosts sometimes eat through the
asphalt, creating large and dangerous holes. In the spring, the
yellow taxicabs race through those holes tilted to a side.
</P>
<P>
   CHINATOWN REALITY: The streets are always full of people,
everything is incredibly dirty, the facades scream with tasteless
bright neons. Yes, on one hand this place does stink, but on the
other hand it emanates spirituality. One thing is sure: it does not
try to pretend anything.

</P>
<P>
   EAVESDROPPING: Keep your ears pricked at all times and you will
be as entertained as much by what you hear as by what you see.
Behind the gruff exteriors, Manhattanites are a wistful,
open-hearted lot, and, perhaps because over 40 per cent are
immigrants, they have a knack of muscling newcomers into instant
conversations which can culminate in lifelong friendships.
</P>
<P>
   DIALECT Bus drivers are a higher breed and will appreciate it if
you thank them as you disembark (one is said to salute his
passengers with ``Get'cher smile on, folks; nobody rides dis bus
today widdout a smile'').

<P>
   From ``New York City: The Rough Guide,'' by Martin Dunford and
Jack Holland.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBIES' COUSINS: The New York City Police _ the N.Y.P.D., a k a
``New York's Finest'' _ are for the most part approachable, helpful
and overworked. This means that asking directions gets a friendly
response, reporting a theft a weary ``Whaddya want me to do about
it'' _ and any smile is greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   MOOD: A sense of nervy self-preservation is rife here. People
make studied efforts to avoid eye contact, and any unusual
behaviour clears a space immediately: the atmosphere of impending
violence is sometimes sniffable. . .
</P>
<P>
   New York's tension doesn't automatically mean violence; it's
largely due to the frenetic pace at which most of the city
operates. Take several million people, pump them full of caffeine,
make them believe that they have to get where they're going five
minutes faster than is actually possible, and pack them onto a tiny
island _ there's bound to be an edge in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ... Few people seem to have time for anything not on their
mental schedule. Even asking for directions on the street is best
done with an awareness of this, ideally while moving at the same
pace and in the same direction of the informant.

   EXTREMES: Dense, immense, intense _ there is no other place with
as much upfront allure. The bagels have the most cream cheese, the
panhandlers have the best stories, you can take your dog to church,
you can pray to Mecca (or Wiccan) in the street, sell lobster
bisque from a hot-dog stand and no one will bat an eyelid. &QL;

   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Chilean soldiers still march to the tune of
the stern martial music _ the Badenweiler, Nibelung and Ferbelin _
that the Prussians brought with them in 1885 when Chile invited
them to modernize its army. The soldiers' medals, uniforms and
goose-stepping also evoke that era, making the force appear
profoundly anachronistic, even in a nation as tradition-bound as
this one.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the misfit was only superficial. Even a
decade ago, Chile's armed forces still had a powerful grip on the
country, overseeing not only its defense, but also its economic and
political affairs. A law unto themselves, they rousted dissidents
from their beds and tortured and executed them at will.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, they are losing their commanding position in
Chilean society. That became strikingly evident last week, as Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, their former leader, was stripped of his
senatorial immunity by the Supreme Court, clearing the way for his
probable arrest and trial. In response, all the top military
commanders could do was grumble, publicly and bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces and especially the army are politically
isolated,'' said Raul Sohr, a sociologist and student of military
affairs here. ``The correlation of forces have simply shifted
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The political role of the military is diminishing little by
little,'' said Francisco Javier Cuadra, a lawyer who was General
Pinochet's chief of staff between 1984 and 1987. ``And as Pinochet
leaves the stage, its profile will diminish even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Two major events created the slope the military is sliding down,
which is all the more noteworthy because old authoritarian habits
are returning in neighboring Peru and some other South American
countries.
</P>
<P>
   One, of course, was the arrest of Pinochet in London two years
ago on a Spanish warrant charging him with gross violations of
human rights, including kidnapping, murder and torture. The arrest
encouraged a rush of attention to human rights abuses in this
usually closed society and emboldened prosecuting judges to
investigate and charge scores of retired and acting police and
military officers. When the prosecutions began, the general was not
around to quash them. The military's accustomed impunity began to
erode.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Chilean government, pressing for General Pinochet's
return, argued that he should face Chilean rather than Spanish
justice as a matter of sovereignty, and the military _ which does
not want him to face any trial at all _ went along. Since March,
when the general returned to Chile after the British released him
on humanitarian grounds, he has been too weak to block the
prosecutions of fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial event was Chile's election of Ricardo Lagos in
January as the first Socialist president since 1973, when Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende with the help of the Nixon
administration. In his first months in power, Lagos has pushed
forward the economic deregulation policies first pioneered by
Pinochet and eliminated capital restrictions loathed by Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   With Marxism no longer a problem, the United States, which
strongly supported the Pinochet coup, is now strongly backing
civilian rule. Domestic fears of communism have faded, too,
removing the armed forces' chief argument for one of the largest
per capita military budgets in Latin America. Chile's business
community, while maintaining support for Pinochet, has drawn back
from pushing the military to intervene to protect him, because they
know such turbulence would deter international credit, investment
and trade as the country emerges from a recession.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor is simply the passage of time. Commanders have
rotated, and the most senior of the Pinochet era have retired.
Younger officers remain devoted to Pinochet, but most focus on
relations with the politicians who hold the purse strings for the
new frigates, fighter jets and tanks they say they desperately
need.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a new generation on the Supreme Court (only three of
20 justices remain from Pinochet's time) has ruled that cases of
missing people can be treated as kidnappings. Until a body is
produced, a kidnapping case is considered open. The approach has
opened a multitude of cases that had been shut by a 1978 amnesty
for political crimes _ including killings _ decreed under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed the armed forces to the negotiating table with human
rights lawyers and led to top officers' signing a document in June
that promised their assistance in finding the bodies of the
missing, in exchange for testifying in private and receiving
immunity. The agreement was the first time the military
acknowledged that members of the security forces had played a role
in the wrongful death of anybody and the first time it publicly
retreated from old rebuttals that either the disappeared had been
killed in civil conflicts or that they were not dead at all, but
had merely left the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great advance,'' said Mario Fernandez Baeza, Lagos'
defense minister. ``Only two years ago, a large sector of the
society, including the armed forces in a quiet way, justified those
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with even its border disputes with Peru and Argentina
settled over the last three years, the military is trying to learn
to live without enemies. That may mean living with new masters.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has begun negotiations with conservative lawmakers to
change the constitution written during the Pinochet era, which
gives the military special powers, including wide-ranging autonomy
and representation in the Senate. He has also been forthright about
claiming his superiority over the armed forces, on several
occasions publicly scolding military chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   After Gen. Ricardo Izurieta, the army chief, defiantly told
reporters he needed no one's permission to visit Pinochet after
last week's ruling, Lagos observed, sharply: ``The command of our
country rests on what I decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently such a clash would have sent shudders through
Chile. But Izurieta has learned to balance his relations with two
civilian presidents and hard-liners within the armed forces unhappy
that he has not better defended Pinochet. After his words of
defiance, he immediately reiterated the military's promise to seek
the whereabouts of the missing. Lagos, for his part, said he did
not mind that Izurieta and other commanders made a courtesy visit
to their old leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely regulated conflict,'' said Cuadra, the
former Pinochet aide. ``It's political theater with both Lagos and
Izurieta each playing a role and each knowing the other's lines in
the libretto.''

   NEW YORK _ Marcus Loew, who founded Loews Theaters in the early
1900s, once said: ``We sell tickets to theaters, not movies.'' That
was certainly the case when the grand movie palaces of the 1910s,
'20s and '30s lit up America.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the theaters were showy grandes dames. They
flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble floors and architectural
ornamentation worthy of the Sun King. The Loews Paradise in Fordham
in the Bronx was beyond rococo, festooned with statues, elaborate
archways and intricate frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   By the '40s, the golden age of movie palaces was falling into a
decline that, in the '70s, the mall-driven rise of the multiplex
began to counter, only for it to be clobbered again by the VCR
craze.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, a new grandiosity has arrived,
inflating cinemas into Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as
many as 30 screens, the theaters competing with their film
selections in terms of theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   AMC, the national movie chain formerly known as American
Multi-Cinema, has built 11 30-screen theaters in six cities,
including Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit, Dallas and
Houston. On West 42nd Street in Manhattan, it has erected the AMC
Empire 25, which, as its name suggests, has a mere 25 screens.
There are also four roof decks _ a sublime amenity for stargazers,
sun addicts and smokers. Those who want an unencumbered view of
Manhattan's skyline can choose to look from outdoors or indoors,
thanks to vast banks of windows. At one of six concession stands,
there is cafe seating and several television monitors, which show
coming attractions as well as interviews with luminaries on Cable
News Network. There is also a VIP room for celebrities who don't
want to mingle with hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street is a Loews, with a ceiling fresco in the lobby
and wall murals meant to hark back to the likes of the Paradise.
This cinematic emporium has 13 screens, TV sets at the concession
stands and, like AMC, several talking machines where moviegoers can
purchase tickets. It also has a restaurant that supplies the
concession stands with more than the usual movie fare, reflecting
the fact that more profits are made there than on ticket sales. On
the menu are mini mozzarella sticks ($5.99), chicken quesadillas
($5.99), potato skins ($6.99) and popcorn shrimp ($7.99).
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners pin this bigger-is-better, more-is-more ethos
squarely on the synergy of the booming economy and changing
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are good,'' said Rick King, a spokesman for AMC.
``People have more disposable income.'' And those people, he said,
include baby boomers who have become empty nesters, and
big-spending teen-agers and young adults, who are savvy and
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's teen-ager and young adult movie-goers have higher
expectations in a technical sense,'' King said, ``for sound and
picture quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The cinemas reflect the shift. ``We've returned our attention to
film presentation and showmanship in our buildings,'' said Marc
Pascucci, a spokesman for Loews. ``The consumer is a lot more savvy
about the presentation. Entertainment has become news.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, every possible technological advance is being
incorporated: digital sound, bigger screens and stadium seating,
where everyone is on a riser.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happens is, the moviegoing experience is more powerful
and more consuming,'' Pascucci said. ``What we've found is that
instead of going to an ordinary theater in the neighborhood, people
will go to a theater one or more miles away if it's splashier.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all that focus, the new grandiosity holds little
resemblance to the old. What technology gives now, atmosphere
offered then.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Jones, a senior associate at Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer
Associates, a Manhattan-based architectural firm, said the old
movie palaces, with their mixing of Baroque, Italian Renaissance,
Classical and Moorish themes, were meant for fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were going to a different period of time,'' he said.
``They were taking you to a different place. You were
transported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's analogy,'' he said, ``is: buy a plane ticket, go down
to Disney World and end up in the Magic Kingdom. It's the wonderful
world of movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The megaplexing trend appears to be going as global as the taste
for American movies. Loews, which has 245 movie locations in 22
American cities, also has cinemas in Canada, Spain, Hungary and
Turkey. And it has plans to build in Italy and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet the new style in megamultiplexing will last as
long as the economy rides high _ or until some unforeseen social
development steals its audience. The grand old movie palaces _ all
set in urban centers _ died out less from the Depression than from
housing patterns that sucked city populations into new suburbs
after World War II, according to Toby Miller, a professor of cinema
studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The televisualization and suburbanization of American homes
denuded the inner city of its population,'' he said. Modest cinemas
became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another area of vulnerability. Bigger is only better
until it isn't. Years ago, there was a monopoly-busting Justice
Department decree that forced major movie studios, which used to
control distribution, production and exhibition, to sell off the
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   At AMC Empire 25 last week, the backlash against big was more
personal. Yoland Trevino, who is from Los Angeles, said she felt
like ``a rat in a maze'' trying to find a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no signs visible from here,'' she said, looking
around in the lobby. ``It's like sensory overload. I'm
overwhelmed.''

   BOSTON _ ``We must help protect our children, in our schools and
streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our nation's gun laws,''
declared Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in his acceptance speech at
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. In other words,
Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control
the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side
supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National
Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed by
guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at an
additional cost to society estimated as high as $100 billion. Are
current laws adequate to fight this scourge?
</P>
<P>
   The case of Bill Dollar suggests they aren't. For years, Dollar
and his sister Connie Jean, operating from their gun stores in
Birmingham, Ala., used friends, strangers, homeless people and drug
addicts to fill out federal handgun applications, then watched as
these people turned the weapons over to illegal dealers or gang
members from Brooklyn. It was a classic example of straw
purchasing, using someone to buy a gun for a person prohibited from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, guns from the Dollars' stores were used in at least
50 homicides and 901 violent crimes in 12 states, from
Massachusetts to Texas. But despite years of investigation by the
bureau and witnesses willing to testify that they lied on the
paperwork with the Dollars' knowledge, a federal judge dismissed
all the charges against them. Congress has never passed a law fully
and clearly barring the practice, so lying on a federal form was
not enough to convict corrupt gun dealers, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents and prosecutors say that, in fact, the nation's gun
laws are a hodgepodge, filled with loopholes and provisions devised
by pro-gun lawmakers to make the laws hard to enforce. Until the
last few years, all this was obscured by the fact that the illegal
gun market was not well understood. It was generally believed that
criminals and juveniles stole their guns, or borrowed them from
friends, and that given the nation's 200 million firearms, there
was little anyone could do to stanch the supply.
</P>
<P>
   But under prodding by the Clinton administration, the bureau
greatly expanded its efforts to trace the origin of guns used in
crimes, and it came up with a surprising discovery. More than half
of the guns that criminals use are purchased from federally
licensed dealers using gun traffickers, like those who went to the
Dollars, said David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F.
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   This is largely because criminals and juveniles are
brand-conscious, Kennedy said. They want the same high-powered
handguns they see in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Further data gained from tracing crime guns has now shown that
only a handful of suspect dealers, 1.2 percent of the nation's
83,000 licensed dealers, supply almost 60 percent of the guns used
in crimes. Kennedy said this information led to Boston's successful
campaign against guns. Supply was greatly reduced by targeting
suspect dealers, traffickers and straw purchasers, and only one
juvenile has been killed in Boston by a handgun in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the framework of gun laws, including the powers granted the
firearms bureau, has not kept pace with this information. In
addition to being hampered by Congress' failure to ban straw
purchases, the bureau is allowed to inspect a dealer's records only
once a year. It cannot send in undercover agents posing as felons
to buy guns from a gun store; it cannot maintain a computerized
record of gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also lacks authority to regulate sales by individuals
at gun shows or elsewhere, perhaps 40 percent of all sales. This
undermines the effect of the Brady law, which requires background
checks on handgun buyers, but only from licensed dealers, says a
study published this month in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the restrictions created by the Firearm Owners
Protection Act of 1986, a law championed by the NRA. For the
firearms bureau to prosecute individuals who sell large numbers of
guns without a license, it must prove that they are engaged in the
business ``for livelihood and profit,'' a vague term that has led
to cases being thrown out of court. The law also reduced to a
misdemeanor the penalty for dealers who failed to keep records of
their sales, or forged them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, after 1986, it became somewhere
between difficult and impossible to prosecute dealers for selling
guns without keeping a record, because U.S. attorneys don't want to
waste their time prosecuting misdemeanors,'' said William Vizzard,
a retired ATF agent who is now a professor of criminal justice at
California State University at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice president, insists this
is all beside the point. ``The government has every statute it
needs to stop the bad guys, and when they don't, I think they are
just playing politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than focusing on gun dealers, who LaPierre believes are
legitimate business people, he says the Clinton administration
should go after street criminals caught using guns, then prosecute
them in federal court, where they can be given harsher sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But who will make the arrests? The NRA has long opposed
expansion of the firearms bureau, calling its agents ``jackbooted
fascists,'' so that in 1998 it had just 1,631 agents, only nine
more than in 1973. And the Republican-controlled Congress has not
acted on a Clinton administration request last winter to hire 500
more ATF agents and 1,000 state and federal prosecutors
specifically to attack gun crime.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even successful prosecutions of gun law violations are
relatively ineffective. That is because penalties for gun crimes
are light, especially compared with the harsh mandatory sentences
for drug crimes, often 10 to 25 years in prison. In 1998, a task
force of federal firearms agents and New York City police officers
tracked two traffickers who had purchased 90 handguns in Georgia
and were selling them without a license in New York. One was
sentenced to 18 months incarceration. The other received six months
home detention.

relatively ineffective. That is because penalties for gun crimes
are light, especially compared with the harsh mandatory sentences
for drug crimes, often 10 to 25 years in prison. In 1998, a task
force of federal firearms agents and New York City police officers
tracked two traffickers who had purchased 90 handguns in Georgia
and were selling them without a license in New York. One was
sentenced to 18 months incarceration. The other received six months
home detention.

   NEW YORK _ Some in Times Square aren't thrilled by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of Frank Sinatra on the traffic
island at 44th Street and Broadway. Critics say the Crossroads of
the World is too congested for the bronze likeness of a singer with
little connection to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The most historically significant aspect of this proposal,
however, has been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed
forces' busiest recruiting station would honor a man who avoided
the World War II draft and spent much of his life trying to live it
down.
</P>
<P>
   As the historian William Manchester once noted, Sinatra was
``the most hated man of World War II'' because he was getting rich
thrilling American women while their boyfriends and husbands were
fighting overseas. In fact, the site proposed for the 10-foot-tall
statue is almost exactly where in 1944, sailors (captured in a
famous photo) threw tomatoes at the crooner's visage on the
now-defunct Paramount Theater across the street from the recruiting
station, which opened in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra and his family always claimed that he wanted to serve,
but was stopped by a punctured eardrum. It's true that his
exemption was legitimate. But his claim is put to the test by
records of an FBI inquiry into his exemption released after his
death in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra repeatedly said on draft forms that he had ``no physical
or mental defects or diseases,'' as he wrote on one. But when he
arrived at the Jersey City, N.J., induction office in December
1943, he gave Army doctors plenty of reasons to reject him. He told
them that an ear injury at birth and subsequent operations were
still causing ``running ear'' and ``head noises.'' Furthermore, he
claimed to be ``neurotic, afraid to be in crowds, afraid to go in
elevator, ((wants)) to run when surrounded by people'' and had
``been very nervous for four or five years.'' He also complained
that he ``wakens tired in the a.m., is run down and
undernourished.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors didn't question the implausibility of such a
celebrity being crowd-averse. Instead, they verified that he had a
punctured left eardrum and declared him 4F. (The conservative
columnist Westbrook Pegler dubbed him ``bugle-deaf Frankie boy.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for his other claims, Army doctors concluded he was ``not
acceptable material from a psychiatric viewpoint.'' But they
downplayed this in their official report. A subsequent inquiry
noted that ``inasmuch as the selectee was to be rejected on an
organic basis'' _ the eardrum _ ``the diagnosis of psychoneurosis,
severe was not added to the list. Notation of emotional instability
was made instead ((to)) avoid undue unpleasantness for both the
selectee and the induction service.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI investigated as a result of an anonymous tip (passed on
by the columnist Walter Winchell) that Sinatra bribed his way out
of the draft. Agents turned up no evidence of that. But what the
FBI did find puts the statue debate in a different light.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra spent much of the rest of his life trying to compensate
for not serving. He entertained U.S. troops in Italy at the end of
the war. He recorded special disks just for the GIs on the front
lines. And he tried to entertain the boys in Korea, too, but the
Army refused to give him a security clearance, suspicious that he
might be a communist (which, it turned out, he wasn't).
</P>
<P>
   In a way, a statue on that spot would be more than an honor for
Sinatra. It would be a vindication.

A GAP IN TEST SCORES BECOMES A TALKING POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<P>
   Once it was the great taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most American schools and policy-makers are talking about
it openly: the achievement gap between black and Hispanic students
on the one hand and whites and Asians on the other, which persists
even among the ranks of the most well off and well educated.
Fourteen racially diverse suburbs in different parts of the country
have joined to share what appear to be successful strategies for
closing the gap. As a way of forcing school districts to deal with
the disparity, some states are requiring them to break out their
test score data by race.
</P>
<P>
   The breaking of the silence still produces some uncomfortable
confrontations. When a group of black and white parents in suburban
Nyack, N.Y., decided to release the numbers broken down by race,
many middle-class black parents wanted to suppress the scores and
bitterly lashed out at the others for crusading on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities, especially blacks, are often the most reluctant to
talk about the gap in test scores, because such discussions have
been haunted by arguments about genetic inferiority. Unable to
explain the gap, they worry that people will jump to the conclusion
that blacks and Hispanics simply are not as smart.
</P>
<P>
   And often, people have.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic argument was repeated in a section of ``The Bell
Curve'' (The Free Press, 1994 ) by Richard J. Herrnstein and
Charles Murray. Other academics have offered a range of evidence to
debunk their position, which caused an uproar. But Stephanie
Robinson of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group in Washington
that works with communities trying to raise test scores, says the
book merely put into print notions hinted at elsewhere, from
portrayals of blacks in film to banks' refusal to offer mortgages
to those living in black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the history you've got behind the notion that black
people are inferior,'' said Robinson, who is black. ``There's
entertainment history, academic history, there's conventional
wisdom, there's economic history. All of those systems that
consistently reinforce the negative message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got so much weight. If you have a scale, there's all this
history over there, and the evidence over here hasn't been able to
balance it out. We're bucking 200 years of history here.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they really began to notice the gap in the 1980s
as American schools experienced a rise in the number of Asian
students, who tended to score very high, which made lower scores
among blacks and Hispanics all the more striking. In the 1990s, the
gap between white-Asian scores and black-Hispanic scores widened
even more.
</P>
<P>
   Any white who raised the issue risked being called a racist; any
black who did was branded a sellout or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started talking about this 15 years ago, a lot of
folks didn't want to hear it,'' said Edmund W. Gordon, an emeritus
professor of psychology at Yale, who helped conduct a recent
College Board study on the achievement gap. Gordon is black. ``They
felt, `We know we're not doing well; we want to know what to do
about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You tended to get some negative reaction from minority
communities,'' Gordon said, ``because they think, and I think
rightly so, that there is often a very strong element of blaming
the victim.'' He added that minorities often feel that test scores
are used to call attention to alleged inferiority rather than to
inform interventions.
</P>
<P>
   Why talk about it now? Part of the reason may be timing. ``We've
had a few years since the last genetic inferiority attack,'' Gordon
said. ``And so that fear has quieted down a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some trace the reluctance to discuss the achievement gap back to
the 1965 report on the black family by Assistant Labor Secretary
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who described a vicious circle of
fatherlessness and poverty. The backlash from black leaders chilled
intellectual debate.
</P>
<P>
   For years that made it impossible for anyone to consider openly
whether social factors might be behind the gap, said Abigail
Thernstrom, whose widely debated book, ``America in Black and
White'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997), written with her husband,
Stephan, argued that affirmative action policies are misguided
because they deflect attention from the real problem: that blacks
are not well prepared in elementary and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big no-no,'' said Thernstrom, whose next book is on
the achievement gap. ``The fact that nobody is screaming when
George W. Bush talks about the soft bigotry of low expectations,
that shows how much the conversation has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, many black academics are leading the discussion
on the racial gap in scores, and they are pointing to social
factors as the most likely causes. Claude M. Steele, a Stanford
University psychologist who has studied the performance of black
students, argues that racial stereotyping adversely influences many
black students, who start to believe that they are limited by
genetics and carry out a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Ferguson, a researcher at Harvard University, suggests
that teachers' low expectations hinder black students. The results
are often at odds with a history that, black educators say, has
included a reverence for education, even during slavery when
learning to read was punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that some of us who are fairly well identified with
the minority community, whose politics are not suspect, have
insisted on talking about it has made it acceptable,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Black parents are helping to ease the conversation, and the
growing middle class is demanding more from its schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have more and more minority folks in this country who not
only aspire to but actually attain higher levels of education,''
said Michael Osnato, superintendent of schools in Montclair, N.J.,
one of the 14 communities involved in sharing information,
including the use of study groups and advanced courses, to help
close the gap. ``It's created a momentum and awareness to the
issue.'' Some of the other districts are Amherst, Mass.; Evanston,
Ill.; Chapel Hill, N.C.; and Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about solutions has been the logical next step. Experts
are trying to identify the places or cases that defy the trend and
to replicate or learn from their success.
</P>
<P>
   But even that search requires a certain fortitude and a
willingness to keep talking through the difficult, if not painful,
initial discussions. But the solutions are often elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us,'' Gordon said of his work with the College Board,
``the most discouraging thing is that after three years of work, we
ended up being better able to describe the problem than to offer
solutions.''

   Randy Petersen, who expects to fly about 250,000 miles this
year, was on the phone from the Atlanta airport on Thursday, making
a weary concession during this summer of the worst airline delays
and cancellations ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees always kidded me that I was the Teflon flier,''
said the formerly indefatigable Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer
magazine, a monthly for frequent fliers. ``In all the air travel I
do, I've really had very few problems. But I have to say, &UR; man &LR; , the
airlines finally got me this summer. I am no longer the Teflon
flier. I've been spending way too many nights in airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen now joins the business travelers who have been grousing
for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or at all),
lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes and a tote
board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Among
Petersen's peripatetic peers, air travel, once considered pleasant
and even glamorous, is now routinely derided as something akin to
riding a Greyhound with wings, except the bus has more comfortable
seats and usually gets there on time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the peak of the summer travel season, tens of millions
of American leisure travelers, many of whom fly only once or twice
a year, are beginning to see what the sky warriors have been
griping about. Again and again this summer, their vacation plans
have been encountering the gridlock staggering the air traffic
system. Airports, which once put an optimistic bounce in a
traveler's step, are of late regarded as places that ought to have
signs over the doors: Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here.
</P>
<P>
   Recent numbers underscore the grim situation. With 48,448
delayed flights, June was the worst month ever for airline on-time
performance. The Federal Aviation Administration announced last
week that there were 44,401 delays in July _ about the same number
as in July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To see how things have worsened, compare that to July of 1998,
when there were only 25,672 delays. Also, the current delay figures
do not reflect many thousands of flights that have been canceled by
airlines. For example, United Airlines, locked in a labor dispute
with pilots who are refusing some overtime shifts, lopped 4,800
flights from its summer schedule and canceled more than 1,000
flights last week alone. United has also cut 4,000 flights from its
September and October schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Simple math partly explains the air travel crisis. The number of
airline passengers has doubled since 1980. About 640 million people
will board 7.4 million domestic flights this year, the FAA says.
Obviously, scheduling more flights subjects more planes to bad
weather, which the agency says causes 70 percent of all delays. But
there are other contributing factors. Some critics say the airlines
strain the system by scheduling most flights during the same hours
in the mornings and afternoons. And some conservative critics claim
the FAA, despite huge spending for new air traffic control
technology, is an inept bureaucracy that should be replaced with a
privately owned air control organization. Others say that the
airline industry is simply rapacious, monopolistic and determined
to reduce service and boost the bottom line on the backs of
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone still recall the glamour of air travel?'' asked
Rene Foss, who began working as a flight attendant in 1985 because
her mother had been one in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little girl, my mother used to tell me about her
days as a stewardess,'' she said. ``They wore white gloves. They
served lobster thermidor. They had to practice what was called the
art of polite conversation with one another, so they could better
communicate with sophisticated passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could only imagine my surprise when I started flying,''
she added, laughing. ``Now, instead of wearing white gloves, we're
wearing rubber gloves. Instead of learning to practice the art of
polite conversation, we're learning to practice the art of
self-defense against air rage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the times that Foss in her nonflying hours wrote
and performs in ``Around the World in a Bad Mood,'' a musical
comedy about beleaguered flight attendants and clueless passengers.
The cabaretlike show, which taps into America's air travel angst,
sold out early this month at the Fringe Festival in Minneapolis and
is scheduled for four performances next month in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Misery being the mother of humor, other travel experts also find
occasional amusement in the steady decline in the quality of the
airline experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen one carrier that's actually cutting down on the size
of the pretzel bags they give out,'' said C.Thomas Nulty, the
president of Navigant International Inc., a travel management
company in Englewood, Colo. ``A small bag of pretzels is now half a
small bag. I'm not sure where you can even buy a bag of pretzels
that small,'' said Nulty, who estimated that he flies about 120,000
miles a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nulty said airline consolidation often results in more
convenient routes. But he and other veteran travelers worry about
the potential for further deterioration in passenger service as big
airlines continue to swallow smaller ones. For example, the largest
carrier, United, has announced a deal, currently being reviewed by
the Justice Department, to buy USAirways. And American Airlines is
in talks to buy Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, for one, is not hopeful that things will improve any
time soon. The airlines, many of which are enjoying record revenues
as planes take off nearly full in this soaring economy, have no
real incentive to do more than pay lip service to customer
complaints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customer complacency is partly to blame, Petersen said. Last
year, after a summer of airline delays and worsening service,
Congress was weighing legislation that would have mandated fines
for airline delays, lost baggage and other problems. Instead, under
lobbying pressure from the industry, Congress allowed the airlines
to adopt a voluntary set of customer complaint guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business and leisure travelers alike didn't communicate to our
elected officials that we wanted real action,'' Petersen said.
``Instead of having to adhere to a law with teeth in it, airlines
now mollify aggrieved passengers by saying, `Well, how about we
give you a thousand bonus miles and a voucher for Taco Bell? Will
you be OK with that?'''

   Randy Petersen, who expects to fly about 250,000 miles this
year, was on the phone from the Atlanta airport on Thursday, making
a weary concession during this summer of the worst airline delays
and cancellations ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees always kidded me that I was the Teflon flier,''
said the formerly indefatigable Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer
magazine, a monthly for frequent fliers. ``In all the air travel I
do, I've really had very few problems. But I have to say, &UR; man &LR; , the
airlines finally got me this summer. I am no longer the Teflon
flier. I've been spending way too many nights in airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Petersen now joins the business travelers who have been grousing
for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or at all),
lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes and a tote
board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Among
Petersen's peripatetic peers, air travel, once considered pleasant
and even glamorous, is now routinely derided as something akin to
riding a Greyhound with wings, except the bus has more comfortable
seats and usually gets there on time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the peak of the summer travel season, tens of millions
of American leisure travelers, many of whom fly only once or twice
a year, are beginning to see what the sky warriors have been
griping about. Again and again this summer, their vacation plans
have been encountering the gridlock staggering the air traffic
system. Airports, which once put an optimistic bounce in a
traveler's step, are of late regarded as places that ought to have
signs over the doors: Abandon All Hope Ye Who Enter Here.

<P>
   While Ron Wyden was campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat in Oregon
in 1996, a local newspaper ran a letter denouncing him as an
``Ashkenazi'' _ clearly a code word for Jew. It set off an uproar
and some soul-searching in Oregon. How dare a responsible paper
publish such anti-Semitism? But what happened next was instructive:
the editors apologized, explaining that they had never heard the
term and were unaware it could give offense.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden, whose parents fled Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic
senator representing a state in which Jews account for less than 1
percent of the population. Oregon, by the way, is home to not a few
militia members and black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet,
Wyden says he encountered only a ``small hard core'' of haters.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of Wyden bears retelling for those who reacted to the
news of Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
as a running mate with the queasy suspicion that this just cannot
be good for the Jews. Will it awaken the sleeping giant of
anti-Semitism, they asked themselves? Will Jews be the scapegoats
if the Gore-Lieberman ticket is defeated?
</P>
<P>
   Although bigotry thrives, Jews in this country have never before
had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews are no
longer considered ``the other'' in America.
</P>
<P>
   As Wyden found in Oregon, even where Jews are few, acceptance is
at an all-time high. Americans typically either see Jews as
neighbors or kin, or as objects of fascination, or have no
experience with them at all. Paradoxically, the reasons have little
to do with television hits like ``Seinfeld'' and everything to do
with the nation's intense Christian faith. Visit the most
conservative evangelical church in America today and you will hear
from the pulpit mention of ``our Judeo-Christian heritage.''
President Ronald Reagan used the phrase in speeches, and the
concept has been thoroughly assimilated by the religious right.
Gary Bauer invoked it on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Mainline Protestants talk of Jews and Christians as ``people of
the Book,'' the Old Testament that both faiths share. Pope John
Paul II stood in a Roman synagogue and referred to Jews as ``our
elder brothers,'' setting a tone for reconciliation that has
reverberated through the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   More than mere tokenism, this language represents a major shift.
A broad swath of Christians in this country have begun to
recognize, to study and even embrace the Jewish roots of their
faith. Most Christians still believe that Jews would be better off
accepting Christ, but respect for Jews who do not has grown
substantially, scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a growing rapprochement and a sense of
commonality,'' said Max L. Stackhouse, professor of Christian
social ethics at Princeton Theological Seminary. ``Part of it has
to do with the increased encounters with others of the world
religions and the new sense of pluralism in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to the average American Christian who sees
Buddhist books on the best-seller list and Hindu temples rising in
the suburbs, Jews seem downright familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are more like us,'' said Stackhouse, summing up a common
attitude among Christians. ``We feel greater affinity to those who
are Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is intermarriage, each wedding vow a chink
closing up the old religious divide. The 50 percent intermarriage
rate that for 10 years has caused angst among Jews has a flip side:
more and more Americans count a Jew in the family tree. When Uncle
Michael goes upstairs to read the children a bedtime story, it
becomes harder to regard Jews as ``the other.''
</P>
<P>
   But what really keeps many Jews awake at night is the fear that
every new Jewish-sounding surname in the headlines only stokes the
widely held conspiracy theories that the world is run by Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who knows the conspiracy thinking well is Paul T.
Coughlin, an evangelical Christian who wrote ``Secrets, Plots and
Hidden Agendas'' (InterVarsity Press, 2000), because he was stunned
by the amount of conspiratorial talk from callers to his Christian
radio show in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of people who feel that Jews control the
economy through what's called the New World Order, and people on
the far right argue that this is all dictated in the Book of
Revelation where the Apostle John wrote about a world government,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly, Coughlin said, even for a large majority of
those believers _ all but the anti-Semitic and racist fringe _
Judaism is ``not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? They believe that membership in the New World Order is
determined ``more by ideology than heritage,'' he said. ``It's
actually liberal elitists, the media, people in universities, who
are going to control the New World Order.''

</P>
<P>
   In the exhaustive analysis of Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate, one factor has been strangely
overlooked: Lieberman's uncanny resemblance to Sam Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Voters of a certain generation may not be able to look at the
man who would be vice president without thinking of the late
character actor best remembered as the High Lama in ``Lost
Horizon,'' Dr. Zorba in the TV series ``Ben Casey,'' and Gunga Din.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is known as a religious man; Jaffe often played
priests, though he too was Jewish, born Shalom Jaffe in 1891 on
Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned half a century (Jaffe died in 1984), he
played only a few Jewish roles. In ``Ben-Hur,'' he was Saimonides,
Charlton Heston's family retainer and book-keeper, who utters the
line: ``Judah Ben-Hur! You've come back to us like a returning
faith!''
</P>
<P>
   But it is in ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' that the connection with
the senator takes on cosmic meaning. Here, in Elia Kazan's
indictment of anti-Semitism, Jaffe played a Jewish professor. His
name? Lieberman.

 UNDATED: World Order.''   &HT;    Although liberal Jews are suspects, Lieberman, as an Orthodox
Jew who represents conservative family values, is not, Coughlin
said. The senator may convince the conspiracy thinkers that
``Jewish'' and ``liberal'' are not synonymous, he said. He adds
that many of these same Christian conspiracy thinkers actually
venerate Jews because the Bible talks of God's covenant with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. ``It is actually beneficial for Lieberman
to be Jewish,'' he said.
 &HT;    This is not to claim that anti-Semitism has been eradicated,
like smallpox. It lives on, mutates, makes people sick. Wyden says
he received a heap of hate mail when, in a memorable moment
broadcast on television, he asked a lineup of tobacco executives at
a congressional hearing whether nicotine is addictive. The
anti-Semitic letters came mostly from those in tobacco-growing
country, accusing him of destroying their livelihoods, but were
filled with ``religious animus,'' he said.
 &HT;    In the Midwest, the Rev. David Ostendorf, executive director of
the Center for New Community in Chicago, said: ``We did a seminar a
few months ago with five or six Chicago high schools, and when we
asked how many of you have seen racist symbols like swastikas in
your neighborhoods, 90 percent of the kids raised their hands. It
kind of jarred us.''
 &HT;    The selection of Lieberman is likely to uncap a geyser of ugly
extremism. Already, Internet message boards have been swamped with
anti-Semitic postings. The head of the local chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in
Dallas rambled on about greedy Jews on a talk show.
 &HT;    The response was telling. Scores of people posted Internet
messages expressing their disgust at anti-Semitism. The NAACP
official was immediately dismissed.
 &HT;    ``You have your crazies,'' said Jerome A. Chanes, the editor of
``Anti-Semitism in America Today: Exploding the Myths'' (Carol
Publishing, 1995). ``But in the year 2000, whatever anti-Semitism
does exist does not compromise the ability of any Jew to
participate in the workings of society at any level.''
 &HT;    Gallup polls show that 92 percent of Americans say they would
vote for a qualified Jew for president, up from 62 percent in 1958.
Other polls that ask the question differently show similar results.
Even if twice as many people are lying _ and respondents to polls
gauging tolerance often do _ that is still a huge approval rating,
Chanes said. The polls indicate that it is far worse to be a Mormon
or an atheist running for office than a Jew.
 &HT;    So why do polls also show that Jews see anti-Semitism as a
serious problem in this country, and one likely to worsen? There is
a generational divide, said Spencer Blakeslee, author of ``The
Death of American Anti-Semitism'' (Praeger), between older,
immigrant Jews who experienced the most vicious anti-Semitism and
``the post-World War II generation,'' for whom the Holocaust is
history.
 &HT;    A headline in last week's New York Observer rendered the divided
response to the Lieberman candidacy partly in Yiddish: ``Alter
Kockers Shaking, Pishers Are Thrilled.''
 &HT;    ``We have a lot of Jews walking around who are frightened at
things they need not be frightened about,'' said Blakeslee, a
sociologist at Framingham State College in Massachusetts. ``When in
the world are Jews going to learn to take yes for an answer?''
 &HT;    Wyden said that for him the challenge is ``not overt
anti-Semitism or prejudice, but that there may be a significant
number of people who have had little or no contact with Jews,
aren't familiar with the Holocaust and so much of the history that
Jews are sensitive to.''
 &HT;    Wyden says he considers any campaign for a Jewish candidate to
be ``a terrific opportunity, because the slate is clean.''

 &HT;     THE ORIGINAL LIEBERMAN   
 &HT;     By RICK MARIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the exhaustive analysis of Al Gore's selection of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate, one factor has been strangely
overlooked: Lieberman's uncanny resemblance to Sam Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Voters of a certain generation may not be able to look at the
man who would be vice president without thinking of the late
character actor best remembered as the High Lama in ``Lost
Horizon,'' Dr. Zorba in the TV series ``Ben Casey,'' and Gunga Din.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is known as a religious man; Jaffe often played
priests, though he too was Jewish, born Shalom Jaffe in 1891 on
Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned half a century (Jaffe died in 1984), he
played only a few Jewish roles. In ``Ben-Hur,'' he was Saimonides,
Charlton Heston's family retainer and book-keeper, who utters the
line: ``Judah Ben-Hur! You've come back to us like a returning
faith!''
</P>
<P>
   But it is in ``Gentlemen's Agreement'' that the connection with
the senator takes on cosmic meaning. Here, in Elia Kazan's
indictment of anti-Semitism, Jaffe played a Jewish professor. His
name? Lieberman.

<P>
   It's not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state
school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal
about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how
quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year
supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science
curriculum. The word is expected to be restored after the November
school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this
conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic. Rather,
they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their
children's future and the future of their state. These dot-com
times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents
believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a realization that we can't have an informed
generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell,
a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center
for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the
Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. ``It's their
right, it's their inheritance. Instead of seeing science as an
enemy, you see it as a tool.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and
economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution
proponents in Kansas. Scientists and school board candidates _ even
the governor _ said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if
the new science standards stayed in place. Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer
said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been
``scared off'' out of concern that their employees' children would
not be getting a good education and that the work force would not
be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes
affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she
worried the new science standards could ``put students at a
disadvantage on a national level'' and that ``students from out of
state won't want to come here and study because they feel the
standards won't be up to snuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to
those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning.
Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of
the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and
others brought in speakers like Dr. Kenneth R. Miller, a Brown
University microbiologist and author of ``Finding Darwin's God: A
Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In his talks, Miller quoted St. Thomas Aquinas, ``who says it's
wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works
because what it will do is drive people away from religion,'' Case
said. ``That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they
could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics. A 1999
Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored
teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools. Another
poll, released this year by the People for the American Way
Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching
evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that
evolution ``is far from being proven scientifically.'' And 68
percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God
created humans and guided their development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing,''
said Dr. James F. Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso
University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at
the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago. ``I really do
sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for
how the two areas that are so important to our life can work
compatibly together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and
research projects like the human genome project now have ethics
panels with religious representatives. And ``in religious
communities there is an awareness of how important scientific
developments have become,'' Moore said. ``If we don't know what's
going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how
can any religious voices really play a role? We will be left behind
and not know what we need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the battle between evolution and
creationism is over. But the language in which it is fought,
especially on the religious right, has changed. Proponents of
``intelligent design,'' for example, assert that the earth is too
complex to have been created by random processes. Only some sort of
an intelligence could have done it, they say, and they seek to
debunk evolution by, for instance, pointing to gaps in the fossil
record.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments, which scientists find specious, have been well
received in some quarters. Alabama and Oklahoma, for example, have
included disclaimers in biology textbooks that raise questions
about the certainty of evolution. Kentucky recently eliminated the
word ``evolution'' from its curriculum, substituting the phrase
``change over time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several other states are debating similar moves. In Arizona and
Ohio, bills have been introduced that would require teachers to
present evidence for and against evolution, and Case said he has
been contacted by people in Minnesota looking to fend off such a
challenge. And dozens of local school boards across the country are
considering teaching some form of creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California who supports intelligent design, said the Kansas episode
would only stiffen the spines of evolution opponents to show ``that
the neo-Darwinian sensibility is intellectually vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as science continues its inexorable progress, some believe
that religion must, ultimately, embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the church has been good at this,'' said the
Rev. Christopher Carlisle, an Episcopal priest who co-directs the
God and Science Project at Amherst College. ``I think it has been
self-preservationist, and I think the result of that has been we
have been losing people and we have less and less to preserve. An
awful lot of the future of the church depends upon the church's
welcoming these questions and these conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and
Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made
scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical
perspective that is the basis of scientific inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you have to believe in evolution as if it were a
religion,'' Teresi said. ``You see evolution being taught in a very
teleological way _ this organism is built this way because. This
would never happen in physics, where the whole thing is to poke
holes in other people's theories. I would teach evolution with all
its flaws, and emphasize the randomness. We have to live with the
idea that humans are random creatures.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ See. See Lee. See Lee Dansie, a champion street
luger with a Mick Jagger haircut, come streaking through the fog
toward the Pacific Ocean on a flying bit of metal, shoes smoking.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 2000 X Games, in which some 450 athletes from 23
countries participate in such once-renegade ``extreme'' sports as
dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line skating, street luge and
sky-surfing. That last is the ultimate exercise in narcissism, in
which a surf-rider and a camera flyer, sky-surfboards strapped to
their feet and parachutes to their backs, jump simultaneously out
of a plane at 13,000 feet, and fall for 9,000 feet or so,
spiraling, flipping and diving as they hurl merrily toward earth at
about 180 mph, filming all the while.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this city of extremes, both topographical and
economic, has embraced the X games with messianic fervor. Last
summer, the event drew over 270,000 spectators, not to mention over
5 million ESPN viewers, including 37 percent of all male teen-agers
in the United States, according to Nielsen analysis for the
company. (The games will start on Thursday; delayed television
coverage starts on ABC and ESPN this Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   Josh Blackman, 5, standing bug-eyed on Friday as the lugers,
bigger boys with iron abdominals, whizzed past him in a practice
event, succinctly summed up the appeal of the lugers: ``They turn
and they wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   The games, now six years old _ an eternity in youth culture _ as
well as the newer Gravity Games on NBC, are spawning extremes of
their own. This fall, for instance, will see the debut of not one
but two brands of extreme sports trading cards. The stunt biker
Dave Mirra, the Michael Jordan of the dirt set, has his own chewing
gum (Dave Mirra's BMX Bubble Gum), as well as his own pro model
signature Adidas sneaker as well as a cereal en route.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous athletes, including the skateboarder Tony Hawk, ace
executor of ``the 900'' (two and a half turns in the air on a
skateboard off a vertical ramp), have their own videogames, and
extreme action figures and finger-size street luges and dirt bikes
are popping up at toy stores near you. ( Dansie, soon to be an
action figure, said he was looking forward to his check.)
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the unkindest blow to the dwindling band of athletes
who are corporation-shunning street-purists, a Barney-colored
miniature ``vert ramp'' with skateboard now comes with every
McDonald's Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way things work,'' said Chad Kagy, a 21-year-old
stunt biker and bronze medalist from Gilroy, Calif., who may
resemble Harry Potter on his Nimbus 2000 broomstick as he performs
his favorite trick this week. Dubbed the Superman Seat Grab, the
move has his feet soaring behind the bike while his left hand grabs
the seat and his right hand spins the handlebars (got that?). ``One
day you're riding with your friends,'' he said. ``The next day
people want you to represent their bubble gum.''
</P>
<P>
   The extremely big business of extreme sports has been fueled not
only by television but by extreme agents, who now represent
approximately 20 percent of all athletes competing in the games.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme marketing is extending far beyond sports figures and
products. In sportswear, ankle-high skateboarding shoes are
replacing hightops, and cargo pants with extra pockets have become
teen-age uniforms. Adolescent males and those beyond can avail
themselves of Right Guard Xtreme Deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Astephen, founder of The Familie, an alternative youth
marketing agency that represents extreme athletes, says that the
days of ``hey bro'' sponsorship were over, which he defined as an
ex-rider coming up to a rider and saying: ``Hey bro, what's going
on? Wear our sticker and we'll give you a couple of bucks.''
Corporations, Astephen said, have woken up to the fact that extreme
athletes speak to the lucrative market of Y Generation (12- to
24-year-old) males and their $650 billion in annual spending power.
The lure: individualistic sports that look cool and don't require a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are tangible heroes,'' Astephen said of his stable.
``Tony Hawk tours local skate parks and skates with your son or
daughter. When's the last time you saw Tiger Woods or Michael
Jordan doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking svelte for a 47-year-old in racing leathers, Steve
Fernando, a Los Angeles firefighter who took up street luging after
watching it on television, offered a contrasting theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are having virtual thrills through computers
and Playstations,'' he said. ``We're an adjunct on TV, seen through
a point-of-view camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bryant, editor of Men's Journal, a bible of testosterone,
notes that every generation has its instruments of rebellion,
whether electric guitars or scooters whizzing up Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports, he said, ``reject the apparent dullness of
modern life, at least as perceived by a 20-year-old.'' He sees them
as an attempt to ``juice up life,'' to inject a note of edginess
into a flush economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where certain socioeconomic groups are
thinking, if life is full of so many possibilities, why am I not
having more fun?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that efforts to market the extreme
naturally take the edge right out of it. Or, as Bryant put it,
``What could be more mundane than deodorant?''

bigger boys with iron abdominals, whizzed past him in a practice
event, succinctly summed up the appeal of the lugers: ``They turn
and they wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   The games, now six years old _ an eternity in youth culture _ as
well as the newer Gravity Games on NBC, are spawning extremes of
their own. This fall, for instance, will see the debut of not one
but two brands of extreme sports trading cards. The stunt biker
Dave Mirra, the Michael Jordan of the dirt set, has his own chewing
gum (Dave Mirra's BMX Bubble Gum), as well as his own pro model
signature Adidas sneaker as well as a cereal en route.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous athletes, including the skateboarder Tony Hawk, ace
executor of ``the 900'' (two and a half turns in the air on a
skateboard off a vertical ramp), have their own videogames, and
extreme action figures and finger-size street luges and dirt bikes
are popping up at toy stores near you. ( Dansie, soon to be an
action figure, said he was looking forward to his check.)
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the unkindest blow to the dwindling band of athletes
who are corporation-shunning street-purists, a Barney-colored
miniature ``vert ramp'' with skateboard now comes with every
McDonald's Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way things work,'' said Chad Kagy, a 21-year-old
stunt biker and bronze medalist from Gilroy, Calif., who may
resemble Harry Potter on his Nimbus 2000 broomstick as he performs
his favorite trick this week. Dubbed the Superman Seat Grab, the
move has his feet soaring behind the bike while his left hand grabs
the seat and his right hand spins the handlebars (got that?). ``One
day you're riding with your friends,'' he said. ``The next day
people want you to represent their bubble gum.''
</P>
<P>
   The extremely big business of extreme sports has been fueled not
only by television but by extreme agents, who now represent
approximately 20 percent of all athletes competing in the games.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme marketing is extending far beyond sports figures and
products. In sportswear, ankle-high skateboarding shoes are
replacing hightops, and cargo pants with extra pockets have become
teen-age uniforms. Adolescent males and those beyond can avail
themselves of Right Guard Xtreme Deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Astephen, founder of The Familie, an alternative youth
marketing agency that represents extreme athletes, says that the
days of ``hey bro'' sponsorship were over, which he defined as an
ex-rider coming up to a rider and saying: ``Hey bro, what's going
on? Wear our sticker and we'll give you a couple of bucks.''
Corporations, Astephen said, have woken up to the fact that extreme
athletes speak to the lucrative market of Y Generation (12- to
24-year-old) males and their $650 billion in annual spending power.
The lure: individualistic sports that look cool and don't require a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are tangible heroes,'' Astephen said of his stable.
``Tony Hawk tours local skate parks and skates with your son or
daughter. When's the last time you saw Tiger Woods or Michael
Jordan doing that?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking svelte for a 47-year-old in racing leathers, Steve
Fernando, a Los Angeles firefighter who took up street luging after
watching it on television, offered a contrasting theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are having virtual thrills through computers
and Playstations,'' he said. ``We're an adjunct on TV, seen through
a point-of-view camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bryant, editor of Men's Journal, a bible of testosterone,
notes that every generation has its instruments of rebellion,
whether electric guitars or scooters whizzing up Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports, he said, ``reject the apparent dullness of
modern life, at least as perceived by a 20-year-old.'' He sees them
as an attempt to ``juice up life,'' to inject a note of edginess
into a flush economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where certain socioeconomic groups are
thinking, if life is full of so many possibilities, why am I not
having more fun?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, of course, is that efforts to market the extreme
naturally take the edge right out of it. Or, as Bryant put it,
``What could be more mundane than deodorant?''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No matter whether you think Al Gore should be the
next president, give him this much: He has transformed the vice
presidency, the subject of generations of derision, into more than
the butt of jokes. Not content to languish at state funerals, Gore
has been the most productive and industrious vice president in
modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gov. George W. Bush, in a rare compliment to his rival,
volunteered recently that Gore had been a good No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   So it is remarkable that Gore's political coming out here this
week has been designed not merely as the usual paean to the party's
new standard-bearer, but also as a production that will neglect,
obscure and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square
Office,'' only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor from the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the program calls for speaker after speaker to rattle
on about Al Gore the Tennessee farm boy, Al Gore the Harvard
student, Al Gore the enlistee in Vietnam, Al Gore the reporter, Al
Gore the House member, Al Gore the senator and _ blithely skipping
the last eight years _ Al Gore, the man of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that Gore championed an ambitious program to streamline
the federal bureaucracy, or that he was the point man in relations
with Russia, or that he bested Ross Perot in a debate, clearing the
path for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Until he deletes
the word ``vice'' from his title, the political calculation is that
Gore will not be seen as his own man.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unfairly, Bush, who presides over a single state (one in
which the chief executive office is notably weak) and is far less
seasoned in governing, can more easily claim the leadership mantle
because he, at least, is in charge of something.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voters are apt to say Bush is as experienced a leader
as Gore. Asked in a poll taken in late March whether Gore's
performance as vice president made them more or less likely to
support him, 28 percent of registered voters said more likely, 27
percent said less likely and 43 percent said it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most aggressive move to submerge his vice presidency came
last week when he named a No. 2 of his own. By making history in
picking Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first Jewish running mate of a
major party, Gore succeeded in persuading at least some voters to
take another measure of him as a decisive, imaginative leader.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in unveiling Lieberman, Gore was so determined to shed his
own service as No. 2 that he made no reference to the office itself
or to his first-hand knowledge of why it is vital to have a capable
second-in-command. The Gore campaign has been so determined to blot
out the vice president from Al Gore that his title was
intentionally not included in mentions of him in the Democratic
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists and academics argue that it is folly for Gore
to flee from the governing credentials that would seem to be his
most compelling selling point. If anything, they argue, six years
after the Gingrich revolution that catapulted Washington outsiders
into power, voters may be ready for tested steadiness.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University
of California at San Diego, said, ``His strongest suit is, `You've
never had it so good.' He needs to nail down the case that the good
times we're all enjoying can be attributed to the Clinton-Gore
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoffing at the notion that Gore should be dwelling on his
tenure in the White House, William Daley, the Gore campaign
chairman, said: ``He'd be murdered by you all if he was trying to
take credit for all he's done in the last eight years. People want
to hear what you're going to do as president. They don't want to
walk down Memory Lane.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories may be the single biggest reason Gore refuses to
embrace his vice presidency _ but those memories are of President
Clinton. The belief among many Gore advisers is that the
president's transgressions have so soiled the White House that
recitations of Gore's accomplishments would immediately be tainted
by association, or revive talk of the vice president's own lapses,
like his attending a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple. The one
subject Gore is happy to recall, and may well underscore at the
national convention, is his contribution to the longstanding
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   But there is far more at play than Gore trying to break free
from his boss. His advisers say they realize through polling and
focus groups that the vice president desperately needs to spruce up
his image. ``They know Al Gore's been vice president, or they have
an impression of stiff and boring,'' Daley said. ``But here's a guy
who's had a full life.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire to reintroduce Gore and play up his human side has
been a constant in his campaign, and his career, often to little
avail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, campaign advisers say that when Gore takes
center stage, they want voters to remember these facts: He opted to
serve in Vietnam at a time when many young men were finding excuses
not to. He is passionate about protecting the environment. He stood
boldly on his own in the Senate and, over the objections of
prominent Democratic leaders, voted for the use of force in the
Persian Gulf war. He is such a family man that he thinks nothing of
altering his schedule so he can watch his children play lacrosse.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp is playing up such biographical snippets to
address the central paradox of the Gore candidacy: advisers fear
the very skills that make Gore a successful sidekick _ he is
disciplined, dutiful and loyal _ are not the qualities people look
for in a president.
</P>
<P>
   The notion is that voters want an engaging leader who is not
simply a loyal trooper. They do not think someone deserves the Oval
Office simply because he has diligently climbed the rungs of power.
``You don't remind people what you  &UR; were  &LR;  when you're looking for
a promotion,'' said Marla Romash, a longtime adviser to Gore. ``You
want to convince them that you're up for the bigger job.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three times in the last 80 years has a sitting vice
president run on his own after eight years in office, and both
Nixon and Bush had to struggle to get voters to stop thinking of
them as junior partners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon didn't even want the
popular president, Dwight Eisenhower, stumping on his behalf, so
eager was he to get out of his boss' shadow.
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem that has now fallen to Gore, who knows full
well that for every commercial his campaign runs that features the
candidate surrounded by his family or extolling his vision,
Republicans intend to portray him just where he does not want to be
seen: in service to his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can not make the eight years vaporize,'' said Mark
McKinnon, Bush's chief media strategist. ``They are there, and he
has to live with them.''

   GORE-IMAGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ No matter whether you think Al
Gore should be the next president, give him this much: He has
transformed the vice presidency, the subject of generations of
ridicule and derision, into more than the butt of jokes. So it is
remarkable that Gore's political coming-out here next week has been
designed not merely as the usual four-day paean to the party's new
standard bearer but also as a production that will obscure, neglect
and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square Office,''
only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor to the Oval Office.
By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ron Wyden, a Jew whose parents fled
Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator from Oregon, a state in
which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population.
Oregon is also home to not a few militia members and
black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet Wyden says he has
encountered only a ``small hard core'' of anti-Semitic haters. The
tale of Wyden in Oregon bears retelling for those who reacted to
the news of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's anointing with the queasy
suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Although
bigotry thrives and shouts rather loud, Jews in this country have
never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews
are no longer considered ``the other'' in America. By Laurie
Goodstein. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Darwin is back in Kansas.
In the state school board primary this month, Kansas voters
defeated those candidates who last year supported removing any
mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. Now,
whoever wins in November is expected to restore evolution to the
curriculum and reverse a significant victory for advocates of
creationism. By Pam Belluck. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-HASSLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Business travelers have been
grousing for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or
at all), lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes
and a tote board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Air
travel, once considered pleasant and even glamorous, is now
routinely derided as something akin to riding a Greyhound with
wings, except the bus has more comfortable seats and usually gets
there on time. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once it was the great taboo. Now,
most American schools and policy-makers are talking about it: the
achievement gap between black and Hispanic students on the one hand
and whites and Asians on the other, which persists even among the
ranks of the most well off and well educated. Fourteen racially
diverse suburbs in different parts of the country have joined to
share successful strategies for closing the gap. As a way of
forcing them to deal with it, states are beginning to require
school districts to break out their test score data by race. By
Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   SINATRA-WWII-REVIEW (New York) _ Some in Times Square aren't
thrilled by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of
Frank Sinatra on the traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway.
Critics say the Crossroads of the World are too congested for the
bronze likeness of a singer with little connection to Broadway. The
most historically significant aspect of this proposal, however, has
been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed forces' busiest
recruiting station would honor a man who avoided the World War II
draft and spent much of his life trying to live it down. By Tom
Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-LAWS-REVIEW (Boston) _ ``We must help protect our children,
in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our
nation's gun laws,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. In
other words, Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the
job. This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control
the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side long
supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National
Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American
freedom. But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed
by guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at a
cost estimated as high as $100 billion. Are current laws adequate
to to fight this scourge? By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   THEATERS-ORNATE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Marcus Loew, who founded
Loews Theaters in the early 1900s, once said: ``We sell tickets to
theaters, not movies.'' That was certainly the case when the grand
movie palaces of the teens and twenties lit up America's big cities
and small towns. For the most part, the theaters were baroque,
showy grand dames. Some flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, and architectural ornamentation worthy of the Sun King.
Now, a new grandiosity is back, inflating cinemas into
Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as many as 30 screens. Many
theaters now compete with their film selections in terms of
theatricality. By Monte Williams.
</P>
<P>
   XGAMES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ The 2000 X Games, in which some
450 athletes from 23 countries participate in such once-renegade
``extreme'' sports as dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line
skating, street luge and sky-surfing, are spawning some extreme
marketing spinoffs. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GUIDEBOOKS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at what New York
City guidebooks published in various foreign countries have to say
about the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-MILITARY-REVIEW (Santiago, Chile) _ A look at the waning
political influence of Chile's once all-powerful military, which is
all the more noteworthy because old authoritarian habits are
returning in neighboring Peru and several other South American
countries. By Clifford Krauss.

</P>
<P>
   GORE-IMAGE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ No matter whether you think Al
Gore should be the next president, give him this much: He has
transformed the vice presidency, the subject of generations of
ridicule and derision, into more than the butt of jokes. So it is
remarkable that Gore's political coming-out here next week has been
designed not merely as the usual four-day paean to the party's new
standard bearer but also as a production that will obscure, neglect
and even expunge his time in what he calls the ``Square Office,''
only 18 steps down the blue-carpeted corridor to the Oval Office.
By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ron Wyden, a Jew whose parents fled
Nazi Germany, is now the Democratic senator from Oregon, a state in
which Jews account for less than 1 percent of the population.
Oregon is also home to not a few militia members and
black-helicopter conspiracy buffs. And yet Wyden says he has
encountered only a ``small hard core'' of anti-Semitic haters. The
tale of Wyden in Oregon bears retelling for those who reacted to
the news of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's anointing with the queasy
suspicion that this just cannot be good for the Jews. Although
bigotry thrives and shouts rather loud, Jews in this country have
never before had so little reason to worry. The reason is that Jews
are no longer considered ``the other'' in America. By Laurie
Goodstein. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS-CREATIONISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Darwin is back in Kansas.
In the state school board primary this month, Kansas voters
defeated those candidates who last year supported removing any
mention of evolution from the state science curriculum. Now,
whoever wins in November is expected to restore evolution to the
curriculum and reverse a significant victory for advocates of
creationism. By Pam Belluck. (Moved in the ``a'' category.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE-HASSLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Business travelers have been
grousing for years about flights that fail to take off on time (or
at all), lost bags, arrogant customer service, overcrowded planes
and a tote board full of other indignities and inconveniences. Air
travel, once considered pleasant and even glamorous, is now
routinely derided as something akin to riding a Greyhound with
wings, except the bus has more comfortable seats and usually gets
there on time. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-GAP-REVIEW (Undated) _ Once it was the great taboo. Now,
most American schools and policy-makers are talking about it: the
achievement gap between black and Hispanic students on the one hand
and whites and Asians on the other, which persists even among the
ranks of the most well off and well educated. Fourteen racially
diverse suburbs in different parts of the country have joined to
share successful strategies for closing the gap. As a way of
forcing them to deal with it, states are beginning to require
school districts to break out their test score data by race. By
Kate Zernike.
</P>
<P>
   SINATRA-WWII-REVIEW (New York) _ Some in Times Square aren't
thrilled by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plan to erect a statue of
Frank Sinatra on the traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway.
Critics say the Crossroads of the World are too congested for the
bronze likeness of a singer with little connection to Broadway. The
most historically significant aspect of this proposal, however, has
been overlooked: The monument in front of the armed forces' busiest
recruiting station would honor a man who avoided the World War II
draft and spent much of his life trying to live it down. By Tom
Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-LAWS-REVIEW (Boston) _ ``We must help protect our children,
in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our
nation's gun laws,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas declared in his
acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. In
other words, Bush was saying, we don't need more laws to do the
job. This is one side of the long-running debate on how to control
the terrible toll guns exact on the country. It is the side long
supported by the Republican leadership in Congress and the National
Rifle Association, who see new gun laws as a threat to American
freedom. But is this true? In 1998 alone, 30,708 people were killed
by guns in America, including murders, suicides and accidents, at a
cost estimated as high as $100 billion. Are current laws adequate
to to fight this scourge? By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   THEATERS-ORNATE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Marcus Loew, who founded
Loews Theaters in the early 1900s, once said: ``We sell tickets to
theaters, not movies.'' That was certainly the case when the grand
movie palaces of the teens and twenties lit up America's big cities
and small towns. For the most part, the theaters were baroque,
showy grand dames. Some flaunted crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, and architectural ornamentation worthy of the Sun King.
Now, a new grandiosity is back, inflating cinemas into
Brobdingnagian multiplexes that house as many as 30 screens. Many
theaters now compete with their film selections in terms of
theatricality. By Monte Williams.
</P>
<P>
   XGAMES-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ The 2000 X Games, in which some
450 athletes from 23 countries participate in such once-renegade
``extreme'' sports as dirt-bike jumping, aggressive in-line
skating, street luge and sky-surfing, are spawning some extreme
marketing spinoffs. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GUIDEBOOKS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at what New York
City guidebooks published in various foreign countries have to say
about the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-MILITARY-REVIEW (Santiago, Chile) _ A look at the waning
political influence of Chile's once all-powerful military, which is
all the more noteworthy because old authoritarian habits are
returning in neighboring Peru and several other South American
countries. By Clifford Krauss.

   Greens Joke and Reformers Fight
</P>
<P>
   It is easily the wittiest candidate commercial of the 2000
election. In a parody of MasterCard's ``priceless'' television
campaign, Ralph Nader's first spot takes aim at the ways the
major-party candidates finance their runs for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilled tenderloin for fund-raiser: 1,000 dollars a plate,''
the announcer says. ``Campaign ads filled with half-truths: 10
million dollars. Promises to special interest groups: over 10
billion dollars. Finding out the truth: priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   That last line is narrated over a photograph of Nader as a young
consumer advocate. But the commercial overlooks Nader's latest
public role: professional thorn in Vice President Al Gore's side.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party standard-bearer, who polls show is likely to
siphon off some liberal Gore supporters, was not the only
third-party candidate muscling his way onto television last week:
The Reform Party, meeting to pick its candidate in Long Beach,
Calif., broke into rival conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle was between the conservative commentator Pat
Buchanan, representing a new guard in the party formed by Ross
Perot in 1992, and a faction of party veterans that was backing
John Hagelin, a physicist who has run for president twice on the
Natural Law Party ticket. ``We are going to reach back to the 20
million people who voted for Ross Perot in 1992, the people who are
not looking for a right-wing extremist,'' Hagelin said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan seemed to be practicing his own politics of
inclusiveness on Friday, when he selected as his running mate a
black educator from Los Angeles, Ezola Foster. ``We welcome
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other distractions for the Gore campaign. In South
Barrington, Ill., President Clinton faced 4,000 members of the
Willow Creek Community Church on Thursday to speak about his life
after an adulterous affair and the effect that event should not
have on the man he wants to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is
good, and surely, no fair-minded person would blame him for any
mistake that I made,'' the president said. _ By PETER MARKS
</P>
<P>
   Tomayto, Tomahto, Potayto...
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists have long assumed that while people in Beijing
might ponder different topics than those in Oklahoma City, their
ways of gathering information and making sense of the world were
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   New research, however, indicates that people from different
cultures may in fact think differently.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory studies comparing East Asians and Americans, Dr.
Richard Nisbett, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, and his colleagues uncovered two separate thinking
styles. The Asians tended to be more ``holistic,'' showing greater
attention to context, a tolerance for contradiction, and less
dependence on logic. Westerners were more ``analytic,'' avoiding
contradiction, focusing on objects removed from their context, and
more reliant on logic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe an animated underwater scene, for example,
Asians were more likely to describe the background and the
relationship between objects. Americans focused immediately on the
largest fish.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbett's work, because it is systematic and repeatable, may
prompt scientists to re-evaluate their notions of what is universal
and what is local. Dr. Susan Andersen is a professor of psychology
at New York University and an associate editor of the journal
Psychological Review, which will publish a theoretical paper by
Nisbett and his colleagues. She said the research ``turns on its
head a great deal of the science that many of us have been doing,
and so it's sort of scary and thrilling at the same time.'

   Despite Protests, Another Texas Execution
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Cruz, a mentally retarded 33- year-old with an IQ of 64,
was one of two men executed on Wednesday in Huntsville, Texas.
``The execution of persons who are mentally retarded serves no
principled purpose and demeans our system of justice,'' Martha W.
Barrett, the president of the American Bar Association, wrote to
Gov. George W. Bush. The European Union also had called on Bush to
spare Cruz, saying the execution of the mentally retarded violated
international human rights norms.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz was condemned to death for the 1988 rape and murder of a
24-year-old woman. His last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court was
denied by a 7-2 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing to Muggles
</P>
<P>
   First the magic, now the marketing. Harry Potter merchandise
arrived this month in more than 140 Warner Bros. Studio Stores
around the country. Warner Bros., which owns the rights to the
first two Harry Potter books, is thus far selling relatively few
items, among them T-shirts, backpacks and baseball caps. But the
studio has made more than 40 licensing deals for Harry Potter
products ranging from candy to soap, which will gradually appear
before the first Harry Potter movie, scheduled to open Nov. 16,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Walking Out Over Wireless
</P>
<P>
   In a dispute over organized labor's future in the New Economy,
more than 86,000 workers went on strike against Verizon
Communications, the nation's largest local telephone and wireless
company. The union wants concessions from Verizon making it easier
to organize in the company's fast-growing wireless division. The
strike affected 25 million people in 12 Eastern states and
Washington, D.C. Verizon was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition
of GTE Corp.

   ABC's Inventive News Report
</P>
<P>
   ABC News admitted that a report it showed twice on ``20/20''
challenging the benefits of organic food was based, in part, on
nonexistent evidence. The producer of the segment, David W.
Fitzpatrick, was suspended from his duties for one month, without
pay. John Stossel, the correspondent on the report, was
reprimanded. He was told to apologize. _ By JIM RUTENBERG
</P>
<P>
   Tire Trouble
</P>
<P>
   They can't find the flaw in the design or the materials or the
manufacturing process, but the makers of Firestone tires say some
of their products are falling apart on the highway. As a result,
they are recalling 6.5 million tires used on Ford SUVs and a
variety of other pickups with 15-inch wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgestone/Firestone company promises to replace them all _
but only by next summer, a delay that has angered consumers and
politicians. Experts say, however, that the company just doesn't
have enough tires to go around. So while the federal government
investigates 46 deaths and 80 injuries that may have come from the
tires, vehicle owners may wait for nearly a year for replacements.

   Wahid's Last Hurrah
</P>
<P>
   In his state-of-the-nation speech to the Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly, President Abdurrahman Wahid issued a
tough-minded rebuttal to critics who say he has not done enough to
address Indonesia's many troubles. However, Wahid, who is blind,
fell asleep as the speech was being read by an aide. Other aides
fed him candy to wake him whenever he drifted off. Several days
later, Wahid announced he would cede day-to-day administration of
the government to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputi.

   Germany's Jewish Question
</P>
<P>
   After two Jewish cemeteries were desecrated in the western
German state of Rhineland-Palatinate and an explosive device was
found outside a Jewish family's home in Bavaria, German politicians
reviewed a possible ban on the small rightist National Democratic
Party on the ground that it is a threat to democratic stability.
The Constitutional Court, however, has not upheld any such ban
since the 1950s. The government and Jewish leaders said an
advertising campaign for tolerance, called Show Your Face and
featuring sports and entertainment celebrities, would start in the
fall.

   The National Missile Mess
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton nears a decision on building a national
missile defense, an intelligence report warned that the decision
could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold, while
Russia could take destabilizing steps like placing multiple
warheads on its ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The report could erode support for the administration's proposed
missile shield, which is also facing technological hurdles. Defense
Secretary William Cohen postponed making his recommendation to
Clinton by at least a month, citing ``a number of difficult
issues,'' including the need for more tests and delays in building
a new booster rocket.

   The Truth Is Out There
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers this week added nine to their tally of planets known
to orbit other stars, bringing the total to more than 45. Among the
newly discovered planets is one orbiting the star Epsilon Eridani,
located only 10.5 light years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Epsilon Eridani was one of two stars focused on in 1960 in the
first search for radio signals from alien civilizations _ and the
first false alarm. As soon as a radio telescope was pointed at the
stars, loud, pulsing signals immediately burst from the
loudspeakers, which turned out to be interference from a passing
plane. More recent listening efforts by the SETI Institute of
Mountain View, Calif., have not heard anything.

<P>
   Russia's summer lull was shattered by a terrorist bomb that
exploded on Tuesday in a busy pedestrian tunnel beneath Pushkin
Square, killing eight and wounding nearly 100. Within hours, Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov claimed responsibility lay ``100 percent'' with
Chechnya, the breakaway republic where rebel leaders had been
vowing to strike Russian cities. Russian President Vladimir Putin,
however, said it would be premature to blame the Chechens, and
though police quickly rounded up suspects, none was immediately
connected to the bombing.

   For the first time in the Internet's brief existence, more women
than men are going online, according to a survey by Media Metrix
and Jupiter Communications. During the first quarter of this year,
50.4 percent of Internet users were women, and there was a 125
percent increase in teen-age girls online. The survey also found
that women, unlike men, don't surf so much as find sites that help
them save time or money, and return to them.

   Germany's Jewish Question
</P>
<P>
   After two Jewish cemeteries were desecrated in the western
German state of Rhineland-Palatinate and an explosive device was
found outside a Jewish family's home in Bavaria, German politicians
reviewed a possible ban on the small rightist National Democratic
Party on the ground that it is a threat to democratic stability.
The Constitutional Court, however, has not upheld any such ban
since the 1950s. The government and Jewish leaders said an
advertising campaign for tolerance, called Show Your Face and
featuring sports and entertainment celebrities, would start in the
fall.

   The National Missile Mess
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton nears a decision on building a national
missile defense, an intelligence report warned that the decision
could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold, while
Russia could take destabilizing steps like placing multiple
warheads on its ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The report could erode support for the administration's proposed
missile shield, which is also facing technological hurdles. Defense
Secretary William Cohen postponed making his recommendation to
Clinton by at least a month, citing ``a number of difficult
issues,'' including the need for more tests and delays in building
a new booster rocket.

   The Truth Is Out There
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers this week added nine to their tally of planets known
to orbit other stars, bringing the total to more than 45. Among the
newly discovered planets is one orbiting the star Epsilon Eridani,
located only 10.5 light years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Epsilon Eridani was one of two stars focused on in 1960 in the
first search for radio signals from alien civilizations _ and the
first false alarm. As soon as a radio telescope was pointed at the
stars, loud, pulsing signals immediately burst from the
loudspeakers, which turned out to be interference from a passing
plane. More recent listening efforts by the SETI Institute of
Mountain View, Calif., have not heard anything.

 FOR SUNDAY AMs 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 13:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-REUNIONS (Seoul, South Korea) _ Some of the people who
will participate in upcoming reunions that will bring 100 North
Koreans south, and take 100 South Koreans north, recall how their
families were separated by the Korean War and talk about the
uncertainty they have lived with. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-RELIGIOUS-STRIFE (San Juan Chamula, Mexico) _ This rugged
part of Chiapas state has been ground zero in Mexico's lingering
conflict between Catholics and Evangelical Christians. The battles
have blazed on for 30 years, dividing fathers from their sons,
turning violent, and leaving hundreds dead and at least 30,000
displaced in Chiapas alone. But that may be changing. By Ginger
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-VANITY (Caracas, Venezuela) _ When a recent consumer
survey of 30 countries concluded that Venezuelans, men and women
alike, are the most vain people in the world, the results were
considered a bit embarrassing, but hardly surprising. ``Of course
it is true,'' said Marga Bermudez, a salesclerk in a busy beauty
products store at a shopping center in a middle-class area here.
``How could it be otherwise? Ours is a country renowned for its
beauty queens, and so we are always, always worrying about our
appearance.'' By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-ARCTIC-TOURISTS (Yellowknife, Northwest Territories) _
Yellowknife, on the northern tip of the Great Slave Lake, has
traditionally been the Saturday night destination of choice for fur
trappers, gold miners and lonely Mounties. But as evidenced by two
new hotels nearing completion here, a new sushi restaurant with
Japanese-speaking staff, and travel advertisements fattening Up
Here magazine, Yellowknife and Canada's north are undergoing a
tourism boom. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   MALAYSIA-MUSLIMS (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) _ Malaysia, with its
large Chinese and Indian minorities, is a model of multiethnic
harmony in Asia. But people here believe the peace is fragile. They
look in fear at neighboring Indonesia and the Philippines, which
are battling Muslim insurgencies. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   LAOS-PRINCE (Undated) _ Nearly 20 years ago, an 18-year-old
prince, heir to a doomed Asian royal line, commandeered a small
boat and sailed unnoticed with his brother and their nanny across
the Mekong River from Laos to Thailand. Laos had become a Communist
nation, and the prince, Soulivong Savang, feared being co-opted or
killed. Two decades later, the prince _ grandson of the last king
of Laos, who died mysteriously in Communist captivity with the
prince's father and other relatives _ is quietly beginning to
reassert his claim of leadership. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-BORDER (Beirut, Lebanon) _ Lebanon's very limited
deployment of soldiers and police into the south, far from
stabilizing the situation along its border with Israel, is raising
new uncertainties. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINES-FAULTY-CABLES (Undated) _ On May 18, the Federal
Aviation Administration issued what appeared to be an important
safety notice for the world's airlines. Federal investigators had
learned that a manufacturer of cables that work key controls in
many widely used jetliners might not have properly tested its
cables. Samples checked by investigators, the notice said, had
failed to meet minimum requirements for strength. FAA officials
expected the airlines to check their fleets and, if necessary,
replace the cables. But federal prosecutors who were suing the
cable maker said that the system broke down because the critical
information did not reach airlines as intended. By John Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OAK-DISEASE (Felton, Calif.) _ Despite the beauty of the
towering redwoods and bay trees in these mountains some 60 miles
south of San Francisco, it is the more modest tanoak trees that
draw the eye. These tanoaks are falling victim to a new disease.
Scientists call it sudden oak death syndrome, and they are alarmed
by its rapid spread and its ability to kill an ever increasing
number and variety of trees. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-MOVE-AFTERMATH (Philadelphia) _ Gerald Wayne Renfrow
thought the nightmare hit its climax 15 years ago on a gruesome day
when he and his neighbors watched the city police bomb and burn
down his solid working-class neighborhood, killing 11 people in a
confrontation that became a firestorm. ``Now they're bombing us
again,'' said Renfrow, more furious than sad as he girds against
the city's latest attempt at what officials are calling ``closure''
for Osage Avenue. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-REPORT (Undated) _ Almost half the money from federal
education programs is going to the poorest schools in the country,
but those schools continue to lack qualified teachers and
technological resources, including computers with Internet access,
says a new report from the Department of Education. By Edward Wong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-EXCLUSIVE (Los Angeles) _ Details to come. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BIO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The Democratic freshman class
that was elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 was a
remarkable one, loaded with bright and ambitious young reformers
who blended the idealism of their generation with the cynicism bred
by Watergate and Vietnam. Many would go on to bigger things _ Dick
Gephardt to the top of the House Democratic leadership, Leon
Panetta to the White House as chief of staff, Barbara Mikulski to
the Senate. But even in this hotbed of ambition, Al Gore stood out.
By Kevin Sack and Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-DONORS (Washington) _ The Democratic convention starting on
Monday in Los Angeles will be a display of wealth, power and
influence as gaudy as the Republican show in Philadelphia. By John
M. Broder and Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-LOSANGELES (Los Angeles) _ Major public events like the
Democratic convention are opportunities for the host cities to put
a well-scrubbed face forward and for their power elite to stand on
a national stage, displaying a shared sense of civic pride and
identity. But in Los Angeles, a sprawling concatenation of
communities with a restless multi-ethnic character, there is no
single ``face,'' in the usual sense of the word. A surge of
immigration and the rapid shift toward an economy dominated by
small businesses rather than huge corporations have pushed Los
Angeles into a dizzyingly complex transition. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-SECURITY (Los Angeles) _ The police say they are ready.
They've chopped down trees that could be set on fire, uprooted
newspaper racks that could be used as battering rams and fenced off
a good-size patch of downtown Los Angeles with tall, silver swaths
of chain-link in an effort to keep any protests at the Democratic
National Convention from getting out of hand. By Todd S. Purdum.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain soaked parts of metropolitan New York on Saturday as
a potent jet stream disturbance spiraled slowly south from Canada.
Sunday, the same disturbance will spawn a low pressure system near
the New Jersey coast, setting the stage for damp weather along much
of the Northeast seaboard. Farther south, partial morning sunshine
will yield to clouds and spotty afternoon thunderstorms in the
southern Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, subsiding air currents associated with high
pressure will bring sunny skies to the central Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley. Meanwhile, isolated storms will form in the Middle West as
an approaching cool front interacts with increasingly humid air.
</P>
<P>
   The West will broil amid plentiful sun, though cooler air will
be found near the coast and in the Rockies where spotty
thunderstorms erupt.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DANCING LIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   A dazzling display of colors emblazoned the nighttime sky across
parts of the Midwest early Saturday. The Aurora Borealis, often
called the Northern Lights, is frequently seen near the Arctic
Circle, where charged particles from the sun collide with gases in
the upper atmosphere. These gases then emit colored light, much
like molecules in a neon sign give off red light after being
bombarded by electrons. A large solar flare on Wednesday increased
the flow of charged particles from the sun, thus setting the stage
for the dancing lights of the aurora over latitudes farther south
than usual. &QL;

COMMENTARY: PRUDES AND PLAYBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dreaming of a convention gleaming with purity,
Gore aides and Democratic officials bullied and blackmailed Rep.
Loretta Sanchez of California until she tearfully canceled her
fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the shapely former Playmates whom Sanchez hired as
``docents,'' Hef in satin pj's and those bodacious blond twins on
Hef's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Pressuring the spunky lawmaker to switch to a less libidinous
site, the Gore team held hostage her prime-time speaking slot at
the convention and threatened to yank her credentials, fire her as
the Democratic Party's general co-chairwoman and withhold support
for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a three-month contest of wills, Sanchez caved in
on Friday and agreed to move the fund-raiser if the Democrats could
come up with a place with ``that kind of cachet,'' as she put it,
so all her donors would still show.
</P>
<P>
   That got me thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Where could the Democrats go to raise a pile of dough, a place
with that same louche cachet _ a place associated with a
superannuated roue, young buxom playthings, historic sexual
significance?
</P>
<P>
   A place where Hollywood celebrities like Jack Nicholson and
Leonardo DiCaprio hang? A place where the randy, retro goings-on
have made conservatives screech and feminists blanch?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. What about the Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   It's perfect, really. Why do the Democrats need the Playboy
Mansion when they already have the Executive Mansion? The party has
used its Pennsylvania Avenue pleasure dome to shake down millions
in the last eight years. Instead of carting her off to Universal
Studios, why not let Sanchez borrow the White House for one boogie
night to raise money to enlist Hispanic voters?
</P>
<P>
   When Al Gore was a senator, he used to give metaphor dinners, at
which participants would ponder the meaning of the metaphor.
Clearly, the vice president has elevated the Playboy Mansion to a
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are no longer satisfied with being
hall monitors. The men who want to lead the party of free
expression and civil liberties are scuttling away from the Playboy
in Chief so fast they are charging into Cotton Mather territory.
They are so determined to erase the memory of an X-rated president
that they proselytize for everything to be G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gore would be better off if he had held dinners to
discuss the meaning of irony. Then he would understand how risible
this seems.
</P>
<P>
   You can't accept $1,500 in donations from the Hefners and then
get on a high horse when a fellow Democrat wants to use the
Hefners' house to solicit donations. You can't defend Bill Clinton
over a romp with an intern, calling him ``one of our greatest
presidents,'' and then treat Loretta Sanchez like a reprobate. You
can't back Clinton on selling the Lincoln Bedroom to fat cats, and
then mug Sanchez because she tries to lure fat cats with a famous
venue.
</P>
<P>
   You can't fix your problem with women voters by bashing Bunnies.
The president did something lecherous in a staid place; the
congresswoman merely tried to do something staid in a lecherous
place.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may have dragged one congresswoman into line, but he'll
never match W.'s disciplined convention. The Clintons are out of
control, gluttonously and gracelessly gobbling millions for the
Arkansas library and New York campaign that should go to the
lagging Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had been pressuring Clinton to say in his convention
speech that Gore should not be blamed for his wayward ways.
</P>
<P>
   But the president has told friends he wants to make the best
speech of his life, going out like Babe Ruth, who hit three homers
in his last game. So he decided to ``purge'' a few days early and
get that out of the way. But his self-involved, conveniently timed
apologia only served to remind everyone about how the White House
lost its dignity, underscoring W.'s plaints.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Hillary and Bill have begun talking up the idea
that she really was the co-president all along, but they had to
keep it quiet.
</P>
<P>
   So where does all this leave Al?
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary was second banana, was he third? And will he be
relegated to a spot in the lineup behind the Sultan of Political
Swat swinging to knock it out of the park?
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least Gore crushed Sanchez. So he has one good Godzilla
vs. Bambi moment under his belt.

COMMENTARY: END OF THE ZIRP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface words should be set in italics.) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We interrupt America's political silly season to bring you a
special bulletin: Something important and disturbing just happened
in Japan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, I admit that it doesn't  &UR; look &LR;  important, especially to
Americans. So what if last Friday the Bank of Japan finally ended
its ``zero interest rate policy'' (yes, ZIRP)? After all, it's only
a quarter-point rise, in a faraway country that doesn't interest
most Americans now that it no longer seems a dangerous competitor.
And yet I would not be surprised if future economic historians look
back at Friday's move as the beginning of the end for an era, and
not just in Japan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this move by the Bank of Japan is a much bigger
deal than you might think, because of its potential impact on
expectations. By raising interest rates, even slightly, when the
economy is still depressed, the BOJ in effect signals anyone in
Japan who might be feeling stirrings of exuberance that it is
likely to step on the brakes in earnest if the economy actually
shows any signs of booming, or if consumer prices start to rise
even slightly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the contrast: in this country the markets expect the
Fed to hold off for a while on interest rate increases even though
inflation is running at more than 3 percent. Meanwhile the BOJ has
just raised interest rates in an economy where consumer prices are
actually falling, GDP is lower than it was three years ago, and
unemployment is at a postwar high. This says something about what
kind of policy Japan can expect from its central bank in the future
_ and it's not the sort of thing that would encourage people to go
out and spend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My personal guess is that in the near future, whatever optimism
people are now feeling about Japan's economy will evaporate, and
the nation's malaise will be deeper than ever _ thanks in large
part to Friday's action. And while others are more sanguine, both
the International Monetary Fund and Japan's own Ministry of Finance
pleaded with the Bank of Japan not to raise rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why did the Bank of Japan do it? Its officials have been
talking up the need for higher rates for months, yet have never
been able to provide any coherent rationale. Mainly, they claim
that ZIRP makes life too easy for corporations, that it lets them
put off tough decisions. But there's no evidence for this _ on the
contrary, despite the zero interest rate, corporate Japan has
lately been experiencing an unprecedented series of high-profile
bankruptcies. And anyway, since when is it the central bank's job
to strengthen the private sector's moral fiber? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, what we really have here is a newly independent
central bank frustrated by the fact that in a depressed economy it
has no good reason to do what central bankers like to do _ that is,
preach austerity, take away the punch bowl just as the party really
gets going and all that. And so, probably unconsciously, Bank of
Japan officials began looking for reasons to act in
central-bankerly ways. As BOJ-watchers have pointed out, over the
past few months the bank has been systematically ``changing the
goal posts,'' finding new reasons to tighten. It looks very much
like the behavior of someone who starts with the answer then goes
looking for the right question. And once they had talked up the
possibility, it seems, officials at the BOJ felt that they would
lose face if they  &UR; didn't &LR;  raise rates _ that they had to go ahead
with the move precisely because the Ministry of Finance was against
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no way to run an economy _ and that is why this is a story
with ramifications that extend far beyond Japan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For we are, as I pointed out last week, living in the age of the
central banker _ an era in which elected officials around the world
have been persuaded to leave a key economic policy in the hands of
unelected technocrats. It's a delicate balancing act at best _ even
Alan Greenspan has succumbed to the temptation to overreach, to
make pronouncements on policy matters outside his jurisdiction. And
he at least has done well in his proper job.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes the world's third most important central bank,
redefining its mission so as to justify an interest rate increase
that makes no sense on conventional economic grounds _ and arguably
doing so mainly in order to give itself a bigger role. Is this the
beginning of the end for central bank independence, not only in
Japan but around the world?

VIOLENCE BY A MUSLIM SECT STUNS MALAYSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ It was the trial of the century in
Malaysia. But on the morning after this country's former deputy
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, was found guilty of sodomy last
Tuesday, the newspapers here gave more ink to another hearing, held
in a court upcountry.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine members of an Islamic sect were charged with treason
for looting two army camps last month in the northern state of
Perak. The attackers made off with rocket launchers, more than 100
assault rifles, and 1,000 rounds of ammunition. They seized four
hostages _ torturing and killing two _ before surrendering to
security forces after a siege at their jungle hideout.
</P>
<P>
   The violence stunned this normally tranquil country, awakening
fears of Islamic terrorism in a nation where 40 percent of the
people are non-Muslim. Malaysia, with its large Chinese and Indian
minorities, is a model of multiethnic harmony in Asia. But people
here believe the peace is fragile. They look in fear at neighboring
Indonesia and the Philippines, which are battling Muslim
insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   While Anwar evokes sympathy, he has been consigned to history _
the victim of ruthless political infighting in the turbulence of
the Asian economic crisis. The sect's attack, on the other hand,
augurs a stormy future for Malaysia as a whole, in which Islam is a
rising political force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real tradition of Islamic-oriented violence in
Malaysia,'' said Bruce Gale, a Singapore-based political
commentator who lived in Malaysia for 10 years. ``That's why this
incident shocked people so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale said Malaysia was less susceptible to Muslim unrest than
Indonesia or the Philippines because its institutions, notably the
army, are stronger. Yet fundamentalist Islamic beliefs have been
taking root here since the Iranian revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party tripled its seats in recent
parliamentary elections and won control of a key industrial
province, Terengganu. The victory alarmed Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who has been in power for 19 years, even though his party
kept its majority. After leading the campaign against Anwar,
Mahathir now saves his fire for the Islamic party, which he says is
a threat to Malaysia's future.
</P>
<P>
   The party, known as Pas, advocates the eventual creation of an
Islamic state. In the northeastern province of Kelantan, where it
gained power in 1990, women are encouraged to wear headscarves. But
Pas also has a reputation for honest government. That has made it
an appealing alternative to Mahathir's regime, which has been
soiled by its perceived vendetta against Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, they are now the biggest threat,'' said K.S.
Jomo, a professor of economics at the University of Malaya.
``Mahathir is smart enough and savvy enough to go after one enemy
at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The arms heist has become a weapon in the prime minister's
campaign. Although the Islamic party has tried to distance itself
from the sect, Mahathir said the sect's 1,800 members belong to the
party. Government-controlled newspapers have made much of the fact
that the sect, known as Al-Ma'unah, killed only its two non-Muslim
hostages, after torturing them savagely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear tactics have worked, especially among the Chinese,''
said Teresa Kok, a member of Parliament from the opposition
Democratic Action Party, which is supported by ethnic Chinese who
make up 26 percent of Malaysia's population of 22 million.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders mutter that the government may have staged
the heist as a way to discredit the Islamic party. They sneer at
the official version of events: a ragtag gang, impersonating senior
military officers, showed up at two camps after midnight on July 2
for a surprise inspection. They walked past the guards, and loaded
three vans with hostages and enough weapons to equip a small army.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many unanswered questions,'' said Wan Azizah, the
wife of Anwar, who leads another opposition party. She would not
speculate on whether there were other forces behind the attack. But
she said that by linking the Islamic party to the sect, Mahathir
was attempting to cut it off from the mainstream of Muslim Malays
who have been the backbone of his party, the United Malays National
Organization. The party has ruled Malaysia since it won
independence from Britain in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those voters have soured on Dr. Mahathir. They deserted
his party in droves in the last election, largely because of the
Anwar trial. Though Anwar is not viewed as without sin, few here
believe he sodomized his family's former driver, for which he was
sentenced to nine years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force of our success was the Anwar case,'' said
Syed Azman, a member of Parliament from the Islamic party. ``The
Malay community thought it was too much to stomach. Dr. Mahathir
thought that whatever he did, the Malays would support him. That's
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, hard feelings do not necessarily translate into support
for Islamic rule. Mahathir has led the transformation of Malaysia
into one of Asia's most advanced economies. Critics of Pas say that
Malaysia cannot stay on this silicon road with a government that
frowns on karaoke singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really frustrates us,'' said Kok, whose ethnic Chinese
party is in a shaky alliance with the Islamic party against the
government. ``They recently banned women from participating in the
Koran recitation exercises. It strengthens the impression that Pas
is fundamentalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Malaysians are deeply suspicious of anything that
would upset the harmony of their country. When Mahathir warned
people to stay off the streets after Anwar's verdict, the vast
majority complied.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the members of the Al Ma'unah sect were charged with
``waging war, or attempting to wage war'' against the king of
Malaysia _ the actual head of state in a system in which the
monarchy rotates in five-year terms among the hereditary rulers of
the nine Malay states. The crime is punishable by death. If the
accused are found guilty, there is little likelihood that people
here will bemoan their fate as they have Anwar's.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Hello, Democrats, ``Destination, Dream Land,''
awaits you.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles welcomes you to the land of make-believe and makeup
tips, tummy tucks and tireless toning.
</P>
<P>
   Bring us your tired feet, your masses of wrinkles and chubby
thighs.
</P>
<P>
   While you're here anointing your chosen candidate, Vice
President Al Gore, we'll remake and remold you, rejuvenate and
restore your every pore during your five days or so in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Reinvent yourself, just like everyone else in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   You can be whoever you want to be. You can have whatever you
want. This is L.A. and that's our credo.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to trudge back to Pocatello looking the same as when
he or she came (For that matter, who wants to go back to Pocatello
at all?), when for a mere $2,000 you can plunge into the fountain
of youth and come up looking like Jennifer Aniston, or new hubby
Brad Pitt, or both.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're thinking the next five days isn't enough time to
be totally rejuvenated and completely transformed beyond your
wildest dreams, dear Dem, think again.
</P>
<P>
   You're not in Kansas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Brush off the dust of Enid, Okla., and discover the true El
Dorado a golden spigot of beauty, youth and oneness with the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   We'll dazzle you with botox injections and tumescent
liposuctions. We'll pamper you with paraffin hand wraps and
detoxifying herbal wraps.
</P>
<P>
   This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The city where dreams are made and people made up to look like
dreams. And for the dreams that don't work out, L.A.'s the place to
redesign yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lackmeyer didn't exactly reinvent himself. The Cincinnati
native just made the most of an opportunity after his dream of
becoming an Olympic runner didn't quite work out in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   While running at the Santa Monica Track Club, where Carl Lewis
trained, Lackmeyer was approached by a friend and asked whether he
could help get an actor in shape for a role. The actor was Val
Kilmer who was starring as Jim Morrison in ``The Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lackmeyer did such a good job, he ended up with a new career as
a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just blossomed after that,'' said Lackmeyer, 41, who now
lives in Agoura Hills.
</P>
<P>
   When women come to Lackmeyer to get in shape they almost always
have an image in mind of who they want to look like - Madonna, he
says. For men, it's Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   So when we asked Lackmeyer, who trains the Marciano family,
owners of Guess? jeans, to develop a workout for visiting
Democrats, he came up with our 5-day Fitness Makeover. And here it
is:
</P>
<P>
   Day 1: Start with the politically correct warm-up: Walk around
Staples Center twice, refusing to take any money from special
interest groups. ``You may have to run,'' Lackmeyer advises.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2: Lieberman Lunges. Keep head up, back straight, feet close
together and step forward as far as possible, being careful not to
step on anyone else's toes or ego.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3: Presidential Push-ups. Kneel on the floor with hands 24
inches apart. Place legs straight behind, back straight and head
up. Place presidential speech on the floor directly under your
face. Keeping body rigid, lower yourself until your nose touches
your speech. Breathe deeply, repeating to yourself, ``I will win
this election, yes. I will win this election ...''
</P>
<P>
   Day 4: Democratic Dips. Hold yourself straight on bars. Keep
elbows into sides, lower your body by bending shoulders and elbows.
Lower yourself down, (Bill can help you if you have trouble with
this one). Pause, then press back to arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Day 5: Al Gore's Beach Blast Run. Run hard and run long, just
like Al's acceptance speech is likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   Lackmeyer warns that if this doesn't help jump-start your
fitness program, maybe you're not ready for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some Democrats might be too busy partying to fit in a
personal trainer or to work out at one of L.A.'s gyms that have so
many well-toned, sexy members, Congresswomen Loretta Sanchez could
have thrown a fund-raiser and still not gotten Al Gore to show up.
</P>
<P>
   For those Dems, L.A.'s ``Fitness by Phone,'' a training regimen
created by personal trainer Susan Block of Encino, will come in
handy.
</P>
<P>
   Block invented the program to give traveling Hollywood people
the will and the way to stay fit without having a personal trainer
by their side. Instead, they're given a calorie monitor that looks
like a pager and records all their movements throughout the day.
Once a week, they go over the results with a trainer by phone and
set goals for the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're empowering people to take personal responsibility,''
said Block, who has 1,000 clients in a business she developed just
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the kind of trainer that vice presidential
running mate Joseph Lieberman would advocate.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody should leave Los Angeles without availing
themselves of all the cosmic opportunities for cosmetic
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Los Angeles and Beverly Hills have more plastic
surgeons per capita than any region in the world, according to the
American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the American
Society of Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   Women have long sought the services of L.A.'s corps of plastic
surgeons. But according to Dr. Les Bolton of Beverly Hills, a
growing number of men are discovering that plastic surgery can give
them an edge in the business world, especially the e-commerce
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more men in their late 40s and 50s are coming in
because they're competing against 25-year-old billionaires in
e-commerce and they want to have an edge,'' Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to stay fit, so they go to the gym. But if they want
to feel vital and vivacious, they go to a plastic surgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the miracles of modern medicine, it's possible to
undergo several cosmetic procedures in the morning and still make
the evening speeches at the convention without any visible scars.
</P>
<P>
   As you sit, carefully, in rapt attention, fellow delegates no
doubt will remark what a wonderful glow you have.
</P>
<P>
   That glow can be achieved with a 30-minute, $100-$250
microdermabrasion that peels fine lines away and rejuvenates the
skin, according to Dr. Debra Luftman, who teaches skin surgery and
general dermatology at UCLA and who has her own practice.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how much can be done in just minutes. Botox
injections to remove the crow's feet around the eyes, collagen
injections that give you the Mick Jagger mouth, and
microdermabrasion, which sounds like something the Ruckus Society
will be staging for maximum TV time, can all be done in less than
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd start with the tumescent liposuction, which
Luftman calls the ``safest and most effective method available.''
The four-hour, $3,000-$6,000 procedure shaves off mounds of blubber
while you're awake with a local anesthesia. No noticeable scars and
by the end of the week, people will notice your too-tight jeans are
a little looser.
</P>
<P>
   However, Luftman warns that the full effects won't be noticeable
until you're back watching corn grow in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch might be transportation or getting trapped
downtown in demonstration central.
</P>
<P>
   If they were smart, plastic surgeons would park a van just
outside Staples Center and offer a surgical strike team.
</P>
<P>
   If you've followed my instructions, by now it's Tuesday, halfway
through the convention. You've started on your fitness regimen,
you've worked in the plastic surgeon and now you're ready to be
pampered at a spa while protesters lay siege to downtown.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when you'll contact the very serene and soothing
Barbara Gauthier, owner of the Gauthier Total Image Spa in Sherman
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   A day with Gauthier and her staff will leave Democrats so
relaxed and rejuvenated, they'll swear Al Gore is the best orator
since Oliver Wendell Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier herself is the quintessential L.A. success story. She
arrived in Los Angeles more years ago than she'd care to remember,
but she does remember her first impression looking over the palm
trees as her plane was landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was paradise,'' she said, her eyes still aglow
with excitement. ``I loved this place, all the diversity it had to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Her road to all things beautiful started out as a simple journey
to buy a washer and dryer. ``I needed the money,'' she said, so she
began selling cosmetics out of a closet in her house.
</P>
<P>
   Today, her business is 15 years old, employees 23 and serves
clients who include movie and TV industry big shots.
</P>
<P>
   People love to feel good about themselves when they're in Los
Angeles. And they love to be worked on by the same people who work
on stars.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like the term ``makeover.'' It sounds too much like
what it is, a schlep that needs to start over.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers: ``image update.''
</P>
<P>
   Give her three hours and she'll find the real you under those
puffy eyes, swollen ankles, sagging shoulders and clothes that
scream ``Home Shopping Network.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the optimal treatment in the minimal amount of time, she
recommends two people work on you at once. For a mere $250, you
could get a foot reflexology to rejuvenate and balance the body,
followed by a facial, a parafin hand treatment, a haircut and
style, and a manicure while sitting next to the cast of a daytime
soap.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Al's given his acceptance speech. He's gotten a
minibounce in the polls, and you're ready for some heavy face
lifting and breast augmentation Friday, followed by some serious
R&AMP;R in Santa Barbara to recuperate from all the parties and the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But then, once you've discovered the serenity of Santa Barbara,
Ronald Reagan's old haunt, it's doubtful you'll ever make it back
to the Rust Belt or the Snow Belt or the Bible Belt or the Borscht
Belt.
</P>
<P>
   What's a soccer mother or father to do?
</P>
<P>
   File a name change with Los Angeles Superior Court, take your
new face, your buff body and your new personal awareness and open a
little chakra shop on Ventura Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destination, Dream Land'' is at your feet.

STAGE SET AT STAPLES CENTER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It's showtime.
</P>
<P>
   After months of planning, the transformation of Staples Center
is complete, with barely a shred of Lakers purple in sight - just a
whole lot of red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   The 900,000-square-foot sports arena now is draped with the
colorful bunting, swirling lights and electric anticipation that
come with the biggest political parties to hit the nation every
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the future of America when you walk into the door,''
said Luis Vizcaino, press secretary for the Democratic National
Convention Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The center has gone from an entertainment and sports arena to
a 21st century convention hall where we will nominate the first
president of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Intricate plans and calculated designs have been in the works
for months to create a striking experience for the 35,000 VIPs,
delegates and media representatives when they venture onto Ground
Zero.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, they will be treated to a festive atmosphere, with
800 moving lights and dozens of hovering, glowing signs reading
``America 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experience begins even before visitors and delegates
enter Staples Center. As they arrive inside the secured perimeter
of the convention area, they are greeted by tall white metal fences
and tight security.
</P>
<P>
   Even outside, there are ingredients of a festive atmosphere. An
open-air plaza next to Staples Center - at 12th and Figueroa
streets - has been blocked off for music, munching and mingling.
Each afternoon, delegates will be able to enjoy ethnic foods, music
and entertainment in the plaza before heading indoors for the day's
meetings and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   In Staples Center, a carpeted floor has been built five inches
above the arena's cement floor to hide hundreds of cables snaking
across it.
</P>
<P>
   The stage sits on the east side at basketball's half-court line.
The podium is futuristic and festive, silver in color with red and
blue stripes and stars and an 18-by-32-foot projection screen above
it.
</P>
<P>
   The height of the stage - five feet - is a key component to the
elaborate design, planners say. It sits lower than any in
convention history, and speakers will be closer to the delegates
for a more intimate feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be the most interactive, open and accessible
convention ever,'' Vizcaino said. ``The feel of the hall is of
openness and inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   California delegates get prime seats closest to the stage and
next to delegates from Vice President Al Gore's home state,
Tennessee. Connecticut delegates were hastily moved down front from
the back row after Gore picked Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman as
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   For delegates, 56 voting stations are set up on the floor and in
the seats. Even the voting stations have a millennial air -
lecterns, each equipped with two telephones and a
futuristic-looking iMac computer.
</P>
<P>
   Looming above the delegates, plush skyboxes have been converted
into television broadcast booths. CNN overhauled three skyboxes to
accommodate equipment and personalities who already have started
broadcasting live from the center.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury suites' hard cherry wood doors have been replaced
with ones made of particle board to minimize damage from media
equipment and harried broadcast technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Looming even higher above are special moving lights affixed to
ceiling trusses. The lights are programmed to focus on speakers or
single delegations, illuminating and highlighting them in the
massive room.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a high-tech sound system was installed for speeches
and music.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the rafters are signs of a grand finale - bundles of
red, white and blue balloons, more than 200,000 in all, which will
be dropped after Gore accepts the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This week, students and adults inflated the balloons and stuffed
them into enormous clear plastic sleeves that were lifted to the
ceiling in anticipation of the big finish.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there will be confetti - lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 pounds of multicolor, shredded paper - also
stuffed in plastic sleeves - will rain down at the same time as the
balloons during the celebration Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the last balloon falls and the delegates head home,
workers will scurry to clean up the arena and television crews will
move in to tape an episode of NBC's White House drama ``The West
Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to wonder what the plot of that episode will be.

   FELTON, Calif. _ Despite the beauty of the towering redwoods and
bay trees in these mountains some 60 miles south of San Francisco,
it is the more modest tanoak trees that are everywhere dead and
dying that draw the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Their sheaves of brown leaves a startling contrast to the
verdant forest around them, these tanoaks, like thousands of trees
up and down the California coast, are falling victim to a new
disease. Scientists call it sudden oak death syndrome, and they are
alarmed by its rapid spread and its ability to kill an ever
increasing number and variety of trees.
</P>
<P>
   So many trees began dying this year that scientists began a mad
scramble to understand this syndrome, first seen five years ago in
a single patch of tanoak trees just north of San Francisco. In July
researchers found evidence that the die-off _ which has spread to
three tree species _ had also spread over 350 miles along the coast
from far northern into central California, fueling concerns that
the disease might continue its rapid spread to other species and
outside of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers became even more concerned last month when another
team of scientists discovered that the culprit appeared to be a
previously unknown species of Phytophthora, a notorious group of
funguslike organisms that includes the species that caused the
Irish potato blight and the species now killing oak trees in Europe
and eucalyptus trees in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen anything like this,'' said Dr. Rick
Standiford, associate dean for forestry at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``Oak trees die, of course, but nothing to
this extent. Knowing what Dutch elm disease and chestnut blight
have done to our forests _ chestnuts are basically extinct _
hopefully that doesn't happen with oaks.''
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency has been declared in Marin County, one of
the hardest-hit areas, and a statewide task force has been created.
Possible federal actions will be considered on Tuesday by the
Department of Agriculture, which has the authority to call
quarantines to restrict the movement of a plant disease.
</P>
<P>
   While describing the disease as having reached epidemic
proportions, scientists note that there are still vast stretches of
healthy oak trees even in affected areas, though how long and how
many of those will remain healthy is impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are predicting, however, that the growing die-off
will have a huge impact on the thousands of animal species that
rely on leaves and acorns from these trees. Concern also is growing
over the fire risk posed by the rapid accumulation of dead trees in
already fire-prone areas. In addition, many homeowners are
panicking over the loss of beloved and valuable trees. In hard-hit
and well-to-do Marin County, for example, a coast live oak tree can
add as much as $30,000 to the value of a property.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The disease was discovered by Dr. Pavel Svihra, a horticulturist
at the University of California at Davis, in 1995 when he was
called by homeowners in the town of Mill Valley to inspect dying
tanoak trees that bordered their backyards. But for years he was
unable to arouse the interest of other scientists, who dismissed
the problem as trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the disease appears to have spread rapidly, showing
up in a variety of forests, from tourist destinations like Muir
Woods National Monument to remote wild lands to suburban backyards.
And it has jumped from attacking only tanoaks, a poorly regarded
species, to attacking prized coast live oaks and black oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence was so overwhelming that something was going
on,'' said Dr. Brice McPherson, entomologist at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``People just couldn't ignore it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The first symptom of the syndrome is the so-called bleeding, as
wine-red sap oozes from the bark. Later the tree is attacked by
beetles that leave a coating of sawdust on the bark and by fungi,
including one known as Hypoxylon that sprouts black warty growths
on the trunk. When the tree eventually dies its leaves go quickly
from green to brown, hence the name sudden oak death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers still do not know how the disease moves from tree to
tree or forest to forest. But in the laboratory this summer, Dr.
David Rizzo, a plant pathologist at the University of California at
Davis, and colleagues discovered that the new Phytophthora makes a
spore that can swim. The finding suggests the disease could move in
water as the spores of other Phytophthora species are known to do.
But the disease could also have spores that are moving via soil,
wind, beetle feet, hiking shoes or tires. With the disease
prevalent in state parks, neighborhoods and other areas frequented
by humans, some suspect humans are the real culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it spread so fast? People visit Muir Woods, get it in
the tires of their car and drive home to Santa Cruz and bingo!''
said Rizzo, whose laboratory discovered that the disease was caused
by a Phytophthora. ``It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists noted that while disease-causing spores are likely to
spread far beyond California, they will only cause trouble _ on the
East Coast, for example _ if tree species in the new areas are
susceptible and if the Phytophthora can withstand a variety of
climates. Researchers are testing both conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still trying to determine just how far the
disease has spread and how many trees have been afflicted, with
estimates ranging from the thousands to the millions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maggi Kelly, remote sensing specialist at the University of
California at Berkeley, and McPherson are using aerial digital
photography to search for early signs of the disease. Stressed
trees often reflect light differently and if these researchers can
find such a visual signature from the air, it would allow them to
quickly do large-scale surveys of the spread of the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a team of six students working with Dr. Steve Zack, a
wildlife ecologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society based at
the Bronx Zoo in New York, has done the broadest survey yet,
individually examining 8,000 tanoak trees over a 350-mile span up
and down the coast. They are finding an average of 15 percent of
the trees are infected across the range and as many as 80 percent
are infected in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of all the missing acorns and leaves will probably be
huge, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cascading effect of losing these trees is going to be
awesome,'' Zack said. ``We're just waiting for the other shoe to
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear why the disease is spreading now, whether it
is because this Phytophthora species is an exotic pest that has
just arrived or whether it is because the species is a formerly
benign organism that only recently evolved a virulent form. A few
scientists are arguing that the disease may be a longstanding but
normally milder one that is temporarily flaring up as it takes
advantage of trees stressed by weather or water conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the disease's spread, many people, in
particular homeowners, are desperate for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of homes, whole neighborhoods are built around these oak
trees,'' said Nicole Palkovsky, oak project coordinator for the
Marin County Cooperative Extension, which provides horticultural
and related advice to residents. ``People are emotionally
devastated when they lose their trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from having a cure, scientists say they are afraid that
current efforts to eradicate the disease may be doing more harm
than good. For example, some land managers and homeowners are
cutting and uprooting diseased trees. If the disease spores move in
water or air or soil or via the tree's wood, such movement could
accelerate the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also are concerned about the effect on the
environment if homeowners begin applying fungicide, which may or
may not even affect the disease, and insecticide, which is being
used to keep the beetles at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago researchers were reluctant to make
recommendations because so little was known. The severity of the
disease, however, is dissolving the hesitation of even the most
cautious researchers, as scientists have begun calling for action,
including quarantines on the movement of oak wood and living oak
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much we still don't know,'' said Dr. Susan Frankel,
forest pathologist with the Forest Service and chairwoman of the
newly formed California Oak Mortality Task Force. ``But we all
agreed that we can't wait any longer.''

FOR POLICE AND PROTESTERS, PREPARATION IS THE WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The police say they are ready. They've chopped
down trees that could be set on fire, uprooted newspaper racks that
could be used as battering rams and fenced off a good-size patch of
downtown Los Angeles with tall, silver swaths of chain-link in an
effort to keep any protests at the Democratic National Convention
from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators say they are ready, too. They're building
puppets to protest corporate greed, practicing passive resistance
and media techniques, sharing organizing tips over the Internet and
warily watching the police cars that circle their ``convergence
center'' near MacArthur Park. They pledge, as one of their Web
sites puts it, to ``celebrate and renew our resistance to corporate
globalization, militarism, poverty, starvation, campaign finance
corruption, sexism, racism, homo/trans-phobia, criminalization of
youth, environmental destruction, prison industrial complex,
genocide,'' and that's just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians? They're nervous, but hoping for the best:
hoping that protests stay peaceful, that freeways stay open, that
the police department that made ``Just the facts, ma'am'' famous
keeps it cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been assured by all the law enforcement entities that
everything's in hand, and that they're prepared for all
contingencies and that everything's going to work out fine,'' said
Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Convention
Committee and the overall organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to peacefully coexist with the demonstrators. They
have every right to be heard and we have every right to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there hasn't been wrangling, or that there
won't be more. On Friday afternoon, a federal judge issued a
temporary restraining order barring the city and the Los Angeles
Police Department from seizing any puppets or written materials
from the headquarters of an umbrella protest group, as the
authorities did in Philadelphia. In addition, the judge, Dean
Pregerson of U.S. District Court, barred officials from entering
the demonstrators' offices on the basis of purported administrative
and building code violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a loud and clear message that the Constitution will
not be suspended while the convention is in town,'' said Dan
Tokaji, a lawyer for the local chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, which had earlier successfully sued the city to
force creation of a designated protest site in clear view and
hearing of the delegates entering the Staples Center, where the
convention will be held. The city's initial plan was to fence off
protesters in a parking lot well across the street and out of
direct view. ``We believe this order will be more than adequate to
protector protesters' speech rights,'' Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tokaji said: ``We remain very fearful. This
department has a long history of violating people's civil rights,
and we're very concerned about the us vs. them mentality that the
LAPD brass has adopted. We believe that's actually harmful to the
cooperation that will be necessary for things to go smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Los Angeles does not have a public culture of robust
political activism or a tradition of large street demonstrations,
and its police department is seldom called on to handle the kinds
of raucous gatherings that are par for the course in New York, for
example. The videotaped image of Los Angeles officers beating the
black motorist Rodney King remains indelible, and nearly a decade
after the adoption of measures intended to improve police training
and discipline, the city is facing the threat of a federal civil
rights lawsuit from the Justice Department, which alleges a pattern
of widespread police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But top officials here insist that the police are prepared for a
firm but measured response, one that could very well involve a
variety of nonlethal weapons from tear gas to rubber bullets,
pepper spray or paint-ball guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see the most professional police enforcement
ever,'' Mayor Richard J. Riordan said in an interview this week.
``It's not just the LAPD. It's also the FBI, the Secret Service,
the county sheriffs, the highway patrol. Everybody's working well
together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elise Hogue, a spokeswoman for the umbrella protest groups,
D2KLA and DAN (which stands for Direct Action Network), said that
it was difficult to estimate how many protesters, from a disparate
range of loosely connected groups, might actually converge on the
city. But she said the estimate of 50,000 offered by some city
officials in the past was wildly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' Hogue added in an interview
from the group's base near downtown. ``Everything is going as
planned. We're making some beautiful puppets and hoping they
survive. But you can't really walk outside our door without seeing
a policeman or an individual patrol vehicle cruising around.''
</P>
<P>
   The police planning has been under way for more than a year, and
one of its principal goals has been to foster better cooperation
than in some past crises, like the 1992 riots that followed the
acquittal of the officers in the King beating. In that violence,
interagency cooperation faltered, but now officials say there are
clear plans. Sheriffs' deputies, for example, will be on hand to
process demonstrators if mass arrests are necessary, leaving patrol
officers available to stay on the streets, while highway patrol
officers will provide security on delegates' buses.
</P>
<P>
   City and Democratic officials acknowledge that their biggest
concern is not the area around the Staples Center itself, which is
compact and can be sealed off, but the possibility that a relative
handful of demonstrators could create disruptions in widely spread
out areas of this widely spread out city and seriously disrupt
traffic on freeways or buses at hotels. Protesters have hinted that
their prime targets might include corporate office towers that have
nothing to do with the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of traffic disruptions or blocked buildings, top
Democratic organizers say they are prepared to wait out
demonstrators rather than provoke violence too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the LAPD that we can start the convention
sessions late if we have to,'' one senior planner said.
</P>
<P>
   Because delegates are so dispersed (the longest round trip from
delegate hotels to the Staples Center is close to 50 miles), Los
Angeles poses special challenges. Event Transportation Associates,
the private concern organizing the transportation planning for the
Democrats, says the longest one-way travel time has been clocked at
1 hour and 40 minutes. Nearly 300 buses will shuttle nearly 10,000
delegates, donors and friends of the party to and from 76 hotels in
seven cities.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In the chaos that was the first few months
of the Korean War in 1950, Kim Hyun-suk, age 14, went off to school
one morning _ and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   His family could only speculate on his fate until, in 1964, they
received word from a neighbor in their hometown that a letter had
come for them from North Korea via Japan, indicating that the boy
who had vanished was in the hermetically sealed communist North.
</P>
<P>
   That ought to have been good news, but it carried its own woe,
for in the dictatorial South Korea of the time, any hint of contact
with the North spelled peril.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, who had received the letter on behalf of the
family, was so excited that he gossiped about it. So the mailman
who had delivered the letter came and confiscated it, unopened,
before Kim Hyun-suk's father could get back to his hometown to
retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, in 1965, the post office notified the family that
a similar letter had arrived _ but refused to hand it over.
</P>
<P>
   With suspicions aroused about links to the communist North, Kim
Hyun-suk's younger brother, now 59, suddenly found himself without
a job, and he had to get by doing odd jobs that he picked up as he
could. His father, who had owned a photography studio, was forced
to close shop and do various jobs, hiring out a car for use as a
cab and traveling to Manchuria for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspected my brother was in North Korea, but we couldn't
tell even our friends that a family member was living there,'' said
the brother, Kim Hyun-ki. ``That would have caused a lot of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   With that history in mind, the family did not even apply to
participate in the reunions that in coming days will bring 100
North Koreans south, and take 100 southerners north, reassembling
remnants of families separated in a war that has never officially
ended, despite an uneasy truce across the 38th parallel since 1953.
</P>
<P>
   But Kim Hyun-suk did apply to join the reunions _ and his South
Korean family was stunned when the Red Cross called to tell them
their son and brother wanted to come to see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently realized that a person I thought was dead is going
to meet me, and I'm overjoyed,'' said Kim Nam-shik, Kim Hyun-suk's
father.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the school told Kim Nam-shik that his son had gone on a
school trip. ``A war had just broken out, and no one had any time
to look for a lost student,'' the father said. ``We had no one to
turn to. It's hard for me to say that we ever gave up looking for
him, but there was no place to get any information, and the war was
intensifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they got word of the mysterious letters that came via
Japan, the idea that his son was still alive had a whiff of
unreality. ``We heard about these letters through a third party and
at times I even doubted they existed,'' Kim Nam-shik said. ``I had
lived until then having given up on ever seeing my son again.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife was more hopeful. ``Every day until she died last year,
my mother placed a bowl of clear water in the garden and prayed for
my brother's return,'' said Kim Hyun-ki, Kim Nam-shik's second son.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot imagine what their reaction to the reunion will be
and sometimes still speak of the meeting as if it might not occur.
``So much time has gone by that if I see him, I don't even know if
I'll have any tears,'' Kim Hyun-ki said.
</P>
<P>
   His memories of his brother are those of a 9-year-old envious of
an older sibling. ``I was the ugly duckling,'' Kim Hyun-ki said.
``He was better-looking, very smart, and he was the one who got the
most attention and love.''
</P>
<P>
   The father is so overwhelmed that he does not know what he will
say to his oldest son at Tuesday's planned reunion. ``It's just
unreal that we are meeting, and that in itself is enough,'' he
said. ``I don't know how much longer I will be alive or whether we
can ever live together for a brief period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have any hope,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreans involved in the reunions are at the forefront of the
effort to rebuild a single Korean nation by first mending hearts
broken long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reuniting the separated families is the most important part of
the efforts toward eventual reunification,'' said Lee Sang-man, a
professor at Chung-Ang University who is advising the government on
unification. ``Without a solution to this humanitarian issue, we
cannot achieve anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of family members separated by the war was given
top priority at the historic summit meeting in June between the
South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, and the North Korean leader,
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   There was a similar, albeit smaller, reunion in 1985, but it was
an isolated event. This reunion is intended to be the critical
first step in bringing the two nations together. As the two leaders
acknowledged, without restoring the human bonds torn by the war,
there would be little hope of cultivating the economic cooperation
and reduction in military tension that would form the foundation
for eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a symbolic event,'' Lee said. ``The
government strongly believes that it is a prerequisite to
everything to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are regarded as the strongest evidence to date that
Kim Jong Il, until the summit meeting a mysterious recluse who
ruled his country with the totalitarian power established by his
father, Kim Il Sung, is committed to rapprochement. Information is
tightly controlled in North Korea, the last bastion of hard-core
Stalinism in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, by allowing North Koreans a tiny glimpse into the lives of
their more affluent relatives in the South, Kim Jong Il is taking
perhaps the biggest gamble since his father's death in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the meetings have been carefully scripted. The
reunions will take place in the tightly sealed environments of
hotels in Pyongyang, North Korea, and Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans visiting Seoul will not even be able to go to
the graves of relatives who died during the separation, a
restriction that is regarded by many in this Confucian society as
more troubling than the inability of the visitors to stay in their
families' homes for the three-day reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the control, nothing can dim the excitement and
tension surrounding the lucky Koreans chosen for the meetings.

<P>
   Kim Joon-sup, now 66, left what was then his home in Pyongyang
on July 9, 1950, and headed for his graduation. He was 15 at the
time, and he had no idea that he would not see his home again.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks earlier, the North Korean army had begun the
Korean War, marching south across the 38th parallel. The army
needed recruits, including Kim Joon-sup and his graduating
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had to go to the church that day and couldn't attend
the ceremony, and my father was working for the railroad and
couldn't come,'' recalled Kim Joon-sup, who eventually became a
prisoner of war in South Korea and stayed on to make his life here.
``So I told my parents goodbye, intending to return after the
ceremony, but 50 years later, I still haven't gone home.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after graduation, Kim Joon-sup's class was herded
onto the school's soccer field and enlisted. ``We never even
touched our diplomas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kim Joon-sup will go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember playing with my siblings on the banks of the
Taedong River,'' he said. ``We would pan for gold, and in those
days, if you did it all day long, you'd come up with a couple of
flecks.''
</P>
<P>
   He will meet his younger brother, Kim Chang Hyup, and his
sister, Kim Kyung Sup. ``She was only 6 years old when I was taken
away, and I remember that she was really pretty,'' Kim Joon-sup
said. ``But who doesn't think that about their baby sister?''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Joon-sup, like the other South Koreans traveling north, is
an ordinary citizen. Most of those coming south, however, are
believed to be North Korean loyalists who have high-level ties to
the Communist Party and are from academia and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   They will have only limited time to meet with their South Korean
relatives, and they will see Seoul only from the buses that will
take them to various sites, including Lotte World, a shopping mall
and amusement-park complex, and Changdok Palace, the historic home
of Korea's emperors. Oddly, North Korea is rumored to have
requested that the palace be included on the itinerary. ``There is
absolutely zero risk for defection,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The Unification Ministry put a priority on older people like Kim
Nam-shik but used a computer in an effort to make the selection
process as neutral as possible. Priority was given to separated
spouses, then to parents separated from children, and then to
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   There were inevitable tragedies. Chang I-yun, 71, had been told
his 109-year-old mother was alive in the North, only to get news
that she had died. And one 90-year-old woman died shortly after
receiving word that her son might be selected to visit Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kim Joon-sup, who was kidnapped into the North Korean army,
was rushed to the emergency room with acute indigestion after
hearing that he was to be reunited with his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Kyung-ja, a life insurance broker whose sister is in the
North, considered herself such a long shot for the reunion that,
like Kim Nam-shik, she did not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned on the TV and saw my sister's name on the screen,''
Moon said. ``I kept calling the Red Cross but I couldn't get
through. Finally I did get through, and just after I hung up the
phone, a television station called and said they were coming over
with a camera crew. I was out of my mind _ and I have to watch my
high blood pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's memory of her sister is rooted in a childhood turned
upside down when the war erupted, when Moon was 10. Her father, a
wealthy industrialist with interests in coal mining, fled to a
remote family cottage, and then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, faced with the alternative of being labeled a
capitalist by the communists who were fast marching down the
peninsula, went to work for them, doing various odd jobs and making
sure she always had one of her children with her so the troops
would leave her alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had to work to support the North Korean troops,'' Moon
recalled, humming a tune the soldiers taught her to sing to keep up
their morale. ``My older sister worked in the canteen and sneaked
rice to us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tide turned against the North Korean troops, the work
Moon's mother had done for the communists landed her in prison.
Relatives refused to help her or her children. ``My uncle, who was
in the army, moved into our house and refused to give us any food,
even though we begged him to just give us a little something for my
baby brother,'' Moon recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The essentially orphaned children found themselves begging for
food from their former servants, who scorned them. Realizing that
they would die on their own in Seoul, Moon's oldest sister, Moon
Yang-ok, took Moon and her younger sister to live with relatives in
the town of Chi Rae in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Yang-ok returned to Seoul, and then disappeared along with
Moon's second-oldest sister and her brother. Moon's mother had also
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were too scared to talk about them because until the 1970s
any word that you had worked for the North Koreans and you were
severely punished,'' said Moon, who is now 59. ``But we were
desperate for news. We spent a fortune on famous fortune tellers,
and any time we had even the vaguest word that they were sighted
somewhere, we would head off for that city or town, only to be
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   She suspected that her sister was in the North, but she did not
know what to do. Her younger sister, Moon Jong-oh, moved to Los
Angeles, and Moon has not heard from her in two years. ``I am
alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Red Cross called her and brought a passport-sized
photo of a sad-faced woman bearing a remarkable resemblance to
Moon. ``It was like seeing someone from another country,'' she
said. ``It felt very strange. I could tell she went through a lot
of hard times, but the man from the Red Cross, he told me she's one
of the better-off ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She suspects that her sister, one of the seven or eight women
who will come from the North, is married to a high-ranking North
Korean official, but those politics do not bother her a bit. ``I'm
happy about that,'' she said. ``It means she's had a good life.''

REFORM PARTY CONVENTION ENDS WITH RIVAL NOMINEES AND LIKELY
LAWSUIT

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Battered and sundered into competing
factions, the Reform Party fought through the final hours of a
bitter national convention Saturday, then limped out of town as two
parties, each with its own ideology and nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Both laid claim to the Reform Party name. But other than that,
about the only thing they shared was a highly questionable future
and the strong likelihood that they would end up in a
campaign-crimping court battle this fall over the original party's
remains and $12.6 million in federal campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from this raucous four-day affair was the commanding
presence of Ross Perot, who founded the Reform Party eight years
ago and, with his rapid-fire talk of changing the federal
bureaucracy, briefly made it a potent third force in U.S. politics.
A couple of years ago, when he sensed that the country, grown
economically fat and seemingly content, had lost its appetite for
him and political reform, he cut his ties to the party, leaving it
to drift.
</P>
<P>
   It came hard aground here in Long Beach this week and broke in
two. Try as they might, party officials could not put it back
together.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the hard-right columnist and former Republican
presidential contender, took one part. John Hagelin, a soft-spoken
perennial candidate who usually runs under the banner of the
Natural Law Party, took the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``At long last we have a home of our own,'' Buchanan said
Saturday after his faction chose him as its nominee. ``And this
party we are building together is being built to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin struck a similar note in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your party,'' he told his cheering followers.
``Breathe strength into it. Grow it into America's next major
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the two men agreed on nothing. Rather, they accused
each other of just about every sin under the political sun,
especially of trying to steal the party away.
</P>
<P>
   As Buchanan saw it, when he joined the party last spring, it was
hardly a party at all. He said his presence would reinvigorate it,
dismissing Hagelin as a political nobody.
</P>
<P>
   In Hagelin's view, Buchanan was a brazen opportunist on the down
side of a political career seeking merely to further his own
conservative social agenda. This agenda is crowded with hot-button
issues like abortion, gun control and affirmative action that
Hagelin argued the party had always avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Both men arrived in Long Beach intent on using the dispirited
party as their vehicle to run for the presidency. The nominee would
get $12.6 million in federal campaign money for the fall run,
because Perot had captured more than 5 percent of the vote in his
1996 presidential run, an amount almost beyond comprehension for a
third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that many national polls had Buchanan pulling less
than 2 percent of the popular vote and Hagelin less than 1 percent.
Or, as Russell Verney, who helped Perot found the party in 1992,
put it in one of the few humorous moments of the week:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a close one, all right. John Hagelin is within one point
of Pat Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition between the two men grew so intense and angry
that they convened separate conventions and nominating processes in
adjacent convention halls.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan ended up with more delegates than Hagelin _ mainly, it
appeared, because he had seized control of party machinery in many
states with the help of the ``Buchanan Brigades'' from his earlier
presidential runs. Hagelin accused the Brigades of having used
everything from fraud to plain sneakiness to take over state
organizations. He filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission and said he would go to court if necessary to prove that
he was Perot's deserving successor.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan insisted that his only interest had been in using the
Reform Party to bring about reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the text of the speech Buchanan prepared to give Saturday
night in accepting his nomination, he talked of ``new reforms,''
but they had little to do with changing government. Rather,
Buchanan repeated what he has been demanding for the better part of
a decade _ outlawing abortion, reining in ``arrogant, unelected
judges, ending racial quotas and preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin talked reform and only reform in his acceptance speech.
He also invoked Perot's name, something no other speaker had done
during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept with humility and with pride the mantle of H. Ross
Perot,'' he began. ``He did more to restore government to the
people of the United States than anybody since Abraham Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot is still a hero to many Reformers. But since he cut off
contact with the party _ he has seldom mentioned it publicly in
almost two years _ there has been no grass-roots push to bring him
back. The impression is that many party members are thankful for
his contribution but feel that he has had his run.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic convention starting on Monday in Los
Angeles will be a display of wealth, power and influence as gaudy
as the Republican show in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Giving some of the most lavish parties will be Hollywood movie
moguls, important Democratic sponsors at a time when the Democratic
National Committee remains heavily dependent on its triad of
financial support: trial lawyers, trade unions and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But the party has aggressively courted corporate support in
recent years and now counts securities firms, real estate
investors, telecommunications giants, software makers and insurance
companies among its biggest donors. All will be well represented in
Los Angeles at seven-figure fund-raising events for Democratic
candidates and in the sky boxes ringing the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have even topped the Republican Regents, the elite
club of $250,000 donors, with a big-dollar cadre of their own, a
group of 18 individuals and corporations called Leadership 2000 who
have given or raised $350,000 or more. The club includes S. Daniel
Abraham, chairman of Slim-Fast Foods; Peter G. Angelos, a trial
lawyer and owner of the Baltimore Orioles; Peter L. Buttenwieser, a
liberal Philadelphia philanthropist; and Louis Weisbach, a former
high school football coach who is now a multimillionaire marketer
of promotional products in Niles, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months ended June 30, the Democratic National
Committee had collected $118.6 million in soft-money donations, the
unregulated gifts from unions, corporations and wealthy
individuals, nearly erasing the traditional Republican advantage in
such contributions. The Republican National Committee reported $137
million in soft-money donations over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have raised nearly twice as much soft money in the
current election season as they did at this point in 1996, when the
party had collected $64.1 million. Most of the increase, however,
is in the party's House and Senate campaign accounts, not at the
Democratic National Committee, which has raised roughly the same
amount as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While unions are six of the party's 10 top donors, the bulk of
the party's money is coming from corporations and individuals who
are motivated both by ideology and an impulse to put down a marker
on what might be a winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Republicans have been more successful with
corporate money because they're in the lead in the presidential
race and control the House,'' said Anthony Corrado, a campaign
finance expert at Colby College in Maine. ``But I would expect we
will see more corporate contributions to the Democrats after the
convention. When Gore tightens up the numbers in the polls and
Democrats look like they have a chance to take the House, I expect
to see corporations hedging their bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three major sources of Democratic financing _
lawyers, unions and entertainment figures _ has increased its
giving to the party over this point in 1996. The three industries
have provided nearly a quarter of all soft-money gifts to the
Democratic National Committee so far this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry has given Democratic Party committees
$5.8 million this year, compared with $5 million in 1996. Labor has
contributed $11.3 million so far this year, compared with $9.28
million in 1996. The biggest increase is in gifts from lawyers and
lobbyists, who have given the Democrats $11.6 million this year,
compared with $8 million for the 1996 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the individual trial lawyers who have donated the
biggest sums to the Democrats were involved in class-action
lawsuits against the tobacco industry and received windfall fees.
Angelos, for instance, has demanded that the state of Maryland pay
him more than $1.1 billion for his part in negotiating the state's
$4.6 billion settlement with cigarette makers. He and his law firm
have given the Democrats $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Each constituency of the iron triangle has its reasons to be
generous to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has generally supported the Democrats on social issues
even as some Hollywood executives have expressed skittishness about
Sen. Joseph Lieberman's condemnation of some movies, television
shows and songs, but their jitters have not yet slowed donations.
In fact, there will be dozens of Democratic fund-raising receptions
in Hollywood next week, including a post-convention party given by
the chief of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Labor likewise is a longtime stalwart of Democratic politics.
And while it has had its publicized fights with the Clinton
administration, notably on trade, it remains ideologically attuned
to the Clinton-Gore agenda. The administration has supported
minimum-wage increases, middle-class tax breaks, expanded benefits
for retirees under Medicare and increased spending on child care
and preschool programs, all policies supported by the labor
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor has been highly critical of Gov. George W.
Bush's record in Texas on wages, labor rights, immigration, the
environment and health care. Teachers unions, an important
Democratic constituency, abhor Bush's support for school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   And trial lawyers, put bluntly, despise Bush, who has made the
trial bar a favorite whipping boy and has moved to limit awards in
personal-injury and class-action lawsuits. The Clinton
administration encouraged plaintiffs' lawyers to pursue
multibillion-dollar lawsuits against cigarette companies which
yielded huge fees to the lawyers. And Clinton won trial lawyers'
undying devotion and financial support with his 1995 veto of a bill
to curb shareholder lawsuits against companies with wildly
fluctuating stock prices. Congress, in a rare act, overrode the
president's veto, but the trial bar has not forgotten the
president's act.

</P>
<P>
   Labor is doing more than it ever has to support the Democratic
ticket, according to John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO,
who provided a detailed account of labor's plans to help the
Democratic ticket this fall. Contributions to Democratic
committees, while significant, are but a fraction of the financial
and shoe-leather efforts that unions are planning for the fall, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are going to spend more than ever because they
want that house over there so badly,'' Sweeney said in an interview
in his office overlooking Lafayette Park and the White House. ``We
can never match them dollar for dollar. But we have people power
and an ability to communicate with people one-on-one. They have to
try to buy that kind of voter contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO expects to spend about $48 million in the 2000
campaign, compared with about $35 million in 1996, union officials
said. Much of the spending in the last election cycle was on
television advertisements critical of Bob Dole, the Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the union is redirecting its efforts away from
television toward organizing its members to get out the vote. The
AFL-CIO and its member unions plan to put 650 full-time workers on
the street this fall, organizing every local, every factory and
workplace, every shift to mobilize support and turn out union
voters, said Steve Rosenthal, the labor federation's political
director.
</P>
<P>
   Other unions are planning independent expenditures as well. The
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees plans
to spend roughly $3 million on outside efforts, including an
advertising campaign sponsored by a union-created group, American
Family Voices. The Service Employees International Union will spend
as much as $5 million, in addition to its hefty contributions to
Democratic committees and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the largest contributions that the American labor
movement has ever made,'' said Gerald McEntee, president of the
1.3-million-member federation. ``Everything is on the table _ the
presidency, the leadership in the House and now the Senate _ and
our members understand the stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats rewarded McEntee and Sweeney with prime-time
speaking spots at the convention Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Executives in the entertainment industry said that the
relatively small increase in donations from Hollywood this year
reflected two factors _ a certain complacency after controlling the
White House for eight years, and a lower level of passion for Vice
President Al Gore than for Clinton. Gore's selection of Lieberman,
an outspoken critic of the entertainment industry, as his
vice-presidential choice has also dampened the ardor for the ticket
in Tinseltown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a different level of enthusiasm when you're
trying to get back something; 1992 was a different dynamic because
we were trying to get back the White House after 12 years,'' said
Donna Bojarsky, a political adviser to several major Hollywood
figures. ``Then there's Clinton as a phenomenon out here that Gore
just can't match. He'll have the money he needs, but the level of
enthusiasm is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial lawyers have been more generous in their giving to
Democrats and more explicit in the reasons. Bush has harshly
criticized what he calls the greed of the trial bar and tried to
limit their fees for winning multibillion-dollar settlements from
the tobacco companies. Bush's support for tort law changes and
limits on settlements has made him anathema to plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has dedicated himself to gutting consumer rights,'' said
Ron Motley, one of the nation's most feared trial lawyers and the
bane of the tobacco industry. ``He's for the pharmaceutical
industry and the oil industry, and he's going to get a substantial
amount of money from the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has advocated revision of tort law and limits on
damages that plaintiffs can receive in damage suits, a position at
variance with Gore's. Some trial lawyers have privately raised
concerns about Lieberman's views, but for most plaintiffs' lawyers
the Democratic ticket remains vastly preferable to the Republican
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general rule, his record on civil justice issues has not
been real strong,'' said Debbie D. Branson, chairwoman of the Texas
Trial Lawyers Association. But she said Lieberman's presence on the
ticket would not diminish trial lawyers' support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what Gore's commitment is, and we certainly know what
the Bush agenda is,'' Branson said. ``We're quite confident that a
Gore administration will support the civil justice system and
protect American families.''

EXILED LAOTIAN PRINCE SEEKS NEW ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, an 18-year-old prince, heir to a doomed
Asian royal line, commandeered a small boat and sailed unnoticed
with his brother and their nanny across the Mekong River from Laos
to Thailand. Laos had become a communist nation, in the orbit of
neighboring Vietnam, and the prince, Soulivong Savang, feared being
co-opted or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, the prince _ grandson of the last king of
Laos, who died mysteriously in communist captivity with the
prince's father and other relatives _ is quietly beginning to
reassert his claim of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The return of a monarchy, even a constitutional monarchy, to
Laos is at best a remote possibility. Royal families continue to
play a role in Asia, from the Himalayas through Southeast Asia to
Japan, but Prince Soulivong Savang is not focused on those
examples.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in New York on a recent visit to Laotian exile
communities in the United States, the prince, now 37, said that
after years of a European education in law and political science,
he has found a new hero in King Juan Carlos of Spain, a champion of
democracy in a country that emerged from a long dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so interested in the future of monarchy in Laos,'' he
said, speaking in Lao through an aide who interpreted. ``My main
proposal is to restore democracy first. The restoration of the
monarchy would be up to the Lao people.''
</P>
<P>
   He is taking that message to Laotians exiled in the West at a
time of unexpected new unrest in Laos, a country of barely 5
million people. In recent months, bombings in the capital and other
towns, coupled with an apparently reinvigorated rebellion among the
Hmong people in the north, has shaken the last largely
unreconstructed communist government of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Soulivong Savang treads carefully in talking of the
Vietnamese, who had hoped to keep Laos and Cambodia within an
Indochinese federation dominated by Hanoi. The federation was a
legacy of French colonialism, which ended in the mid-1950s. The
French also promoted the modern Laotian monarchy. As its heir, the
prince is portrayed in Laos as a client of the West.
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince, who lives in Paris, has been following reports
of student unrest and a surreptitious return of the Vietnamese
military to Laos. He is also concerned about the domination of Thai
business on the fragile economy of Laos.
</P>
<P>
   With an end to communism, Vietnamese and Thai influence would be
gone from Laos, said his uncle, Prince Sauryavong Savang, who
escaped death because he was in Thailand when the sweep of the
royal family took place in 1977. The elder prince regent also lives
in Paris. The Laotian government has never said exactly what
happened to the rest of the royal family, except to announce in
1989 that King Savang Vatthana was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Soulivong Savang said that he was away at school in 1977,
when his grandfather, father and six other family members were
arrested. He was allowed to remain with his mother, Princess
Manilay Khampane Panya, in the royal capital, Luang Prabang, though
under constant surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The government arranged his secondary education, which included
large doses of communist doctrine. A cousin of the late king,
Prince Souphanouvong, had become a Marxist, so there was a
precedent. Because the young prince's family had been stripped of
their money and possessions, he learned to grow rice to feed them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, he said, his friends began disappearing from
school. ``When they stayed loyal to the monarchy they would be
taken away for re-education,'' he said. ``Later I realized that the
government was trying to prevent a group of supporters growing
around me because by the age of 18, I had become a symbol and a
danger. I heard a rumor that I would be sent to a Communist country
for further education. I was obliged to find a way to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince said that he faked allergies that he said needed
urgent treatment by a doctor in Vientiane, now the Laotian capital.
Before his minders could see what was happening, he had fled from
there across the Mekong to Nong Khai, a Thai river port.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, he and his brother were protected by the Thai royal
family until it was considered safe to arrange the prince's travel
to France. His mother is still alive in Laos, he said. They met
last year in Australia, where the Lao government had allowed her a
visit when her daughter, the prince's sister, had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   The Laotian exile community _ 100,000 in France, 40,000 in
Australia and half a million in the United States _ has been
fractured ethnically between Lao and Hmong. The crown prince said
he tells both groups that a constitutional monarchy is their best
hope of unity.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic freshman class that was elected to
the House of Representatives in 1976 was a remarkable one, loaded
with bright and ambitious young reformers who blended the idealism
of their generation with the cynicism bred by Watergate and
Vietnam. Many would go on to bigger things _ Dick Gephardt to the
top of the House Democratic leadership, Leon Panetta to the White
House as chief of staff, Barbara Mikulski to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this hotbed of ambition, Al Gore stood out. As
former Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee put it, ``Al was never a
backbencher.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as they arrived on Capitol Hill, members of the
class of '76 began looking for ways to break out of the pack. Some,
like Gephardt, played the inside game, building the personal
alliances essential for rising in congressional leadership. Others,
like Gore, a young Tennessean with a famous political name,
preferred the outside game.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his way to twist arms or trade favors. While he made
friends, particularly on the basketball court in the House gym,
backslapping was not his political strong suit. Instead, Gore, who
was 28 when first elected, went methodically about the task of
identifying issues _ many slightly obscure but all deadly serious _
that he could make his own.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 16 years in Congress, eight in the House and then
eight in the Senate before becoming Bill Clinton's running mate in
1992, Gore was strikingly effective at winning attention by
championing just-over-the-horizon consumer-oriented causes.
Toxic-waste dumping. Genetic testing. Global warming.
</P>
<P>
   He reveled in the details, in mastering the arcana of arms
control or computer technology, issues the average politician might
find bloodless or simply too hard, then trying to popularize those
issues with the voters at large.
</P>
<P>
   So effective was his strategy, and so media-savvy his approach,
that former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, once the No. 2 Republican
in the Senate, remembered: ``We called him Prime Time Al. That's
what he was known as in our cloakroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as Gore moves toward Los Angeles to accept his party's
presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention this
week, his record on Capitol Hill remains a vital part of his
biography. And the debate over whether its hallmark was prescience
or political expedience will rage over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategists say most Americans are unaware of how
Gore spent the years 1977 to 1992 _ the pre-Clinton years _ and
they plan to highlight that era in convention speeches and films.
``Gore throughout his career has taken on important issues well
before it was fashionable to take them on,'' said Mark Fabiani,
Gore's deputy campaign manager for communications.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself, when asked in a recent interview aboard Air Force
Two to summarize his congressional career, said the message was
simple: ``I will not hesitate to take on any special interest that
is operating to the disadvantage of the American people. And I'll
never hesitate to take on any challenge, however complex or
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign will portray Gore as a man who carefully
crafted his congressional career to maintain his political
viability, a man with little grounding other than his own ambition.
``Al Gore's flip-flops on important issues, including guns and
abortion, underscore why there's a leadership gap in this
campaign,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Gore was engaged in a balancing act for much of his
congressional career. He chose issues that pushed him to the
national stage, but he was compulsive about tending his district
back home. He studiously avoided the kind of polarizing debates
that ultimately contributed to the electoral defeat of his father,
Sen. Albert Gore Sr., in 1970. The issues the younger Gore selected
had the advantage of being virtually nonideological. There was
right and wrong in Gore's positioning, but rarely was there right
and left.
</P>
<P>
   On the most volatile controversies, like abortion and gun
control, he took stands that put his conservative constituents at
ease and then shifted positions as he moved from Tennessee politics
to the national arena. To the extent he ever alienated the home
folks, he usually managed to work his way back into their good
graces by maintaining a relentless regimen of town hall meetings,
sometimes five on a given Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It all left his political rivals with little room to maneuver.
``He picked out issues that unless Adolf Hitler was your idol you
couldn't disagree,'' said Victor H. Ashe, the mayor of Knoxville,
Tenn., and Gore's Republican opponent in his first Senate campaign
in 1984. ``Organ transplant databases. More money for Alzheimer's
research. Infant formula. I mean, who in their right mind is going
to fight against those? He avoided any issue that could be
divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ideological ratings by groups that monitor congressional
voting records typically group him as a centrist Democrat,
particularly on foreign policy, with positions that grew somewhat
more liberal as he moved toward his failed 1988 presidential
campaign. His approval rating by the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action, for instance, grew from 45 percent in his first
year to 78 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO gives him a lifetime voting-record score of 88
percent, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 32 percent. His most
high-profile shift probably was on abortion: he moved from a
reliable vote against any federal financing for abortion, with an
84 percent rating by the National Right to Life Committee, to an
outspoken, unqualified advocacy of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Gore's congressional career was not spent in the
middle of the ideological wars; his interests, his political
instincts and perhaps the memory of his father pushed him
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   AN INVALUABLE FORUM
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic freshmen who entered the House in the
post-Watergate classes of 1974 and 1976 expected to make a
difference, fast, in contrast with their predecessors' long years
of quiet back-bench servitude. Gore hoped to be on the
Appropriations Committee, the seat of federal largess, but he lost
out to his friend and fellow freshman Norm Dicks of Washington. He
landed, fortunately enough, on the Commerce Committee. Dicks
recalled saying that he had done Gore a favor: ``I told him, `Now
you'll be on Commerce and on TV all the time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Commerce Committee had purview over a wide array of
consumer issues _ involving energy, the environment, health care _
and it gave Gore an invaluable forum. He got a seat on the
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and eventually became
chairman of a similar subcommittee of the House Committee on
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   From those perches, Gore quickly became known as a meticulously
prepared, take-no-prisoners inquisitor, aided by his background in
law and his five years as a newspaper reporter. The headlines from
back home _ and some in Washington _portrayed an aggressive young
lawmaker standing up for consumers, whether he was charging
monopoly practices among natural-gas pipeline companies or exposing
an international uranium cartel: ``Gore: Thousands of Babies
Drinking Harmful Formula?'' ``Rep. Gore Breaks Up a Monopoly.''
``Gore Questions Contact Lens Solution Use.'' ''Gore Introduces
Nationwide Transplant Organ Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a pattern that would continue over the years as he
crusaded against the marketing of unhealthy baby formula, raised
early ethical concerns about the use of genetic testing and
engineering, promoted the benefits of midwifery and helped
establish a national organ transplant network.
</P>
<P>
   Barely past 30, Gore was in the thick of the struggle for the
passage of the Superfund Act of 1980, which established a fund to
clean up toxic wastes. He was also an important member of the
Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future. ``We'd bring in top
scientists, top futurists who were looking at technological
developments, their implications for society,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, Gore would become the butt of late-night talk show
jokes for his claim of having helped to create the Internet. But
congressional colleagues say he really was ahead of the curve in
seeing the implications of new technologies, like computer networks
and genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood the link between technology and development; he
could see the future very well,'' said Rep. David Bonior of
Michigan, now the Democratic whip. Mike Kopp, one of Gore's early
aides, remembered him subscribing to scientific journals, ``obscure
publications,'' at home, clipping out articles and bringing them in
for his staff to review.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly had his detractors, who saw his hunger for the
media limelight as extraordinary, even by Washington standards.
Former aides say he was skilled at cultivating reporters, studying
their interests and then catering to them. Still, by most accounts
Gore fit happily into the culture of the House. His father cast a
formidable shadow, but as another famous son of a famous
congressman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., put it, ``It is not looked
down upon in this place'' to have a family legacy. Dingell, who was
the powerful chairman of the Commerce Committee from 1981 to 1995,
became something of a mentor to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could be a demanding, micromanaging boss, traits that have
extended to his campaign. In his early days, he sorted the office
mail himself and insisted on reviewing and editing the most
pedestrian constituent letters. Former aides said he did not take
well to criticism and was not particularly solicitous of advice
from underlings. Though he was accessible, he avoided both small
talk and confrontation. ``Typically,'' said Kopp, ``his reaction
when you criticized him was he'd either walk away or get busy doing
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also hung out with members of the House like Tom Downey
of New York, most of them young men with young families, and he was
among the regulars in the freewheeling basketball games at the
House gym. ``I had closer friendships in the House,'' Gore said,
comparing it with the Senate. ``I just, I had more fun in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in the House gym, his competitive instincts showed.
Bonior recalls walking into the gym one night to find Gore on his
back at midcourt, trying to make an implausible shot that others
could not match. (When asked about this in an interview, Gore said
without a pause, ``Not trying.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ADDRESSING ARMS CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his tenure in the House, at the start of the
1980s, Gore began his move to a more national arena, obtaining a
seat on the House Intelligence Committee and plunging into the most
arcane field in Washington: arms control. It has become a highly
burnished chapter in the official Gore story _ how he heard the
persistent fears of nuclear war from the folks back home, how he
embarked on a secretive yearlong tutorial on arms control with Leon
Fuerth, today his national security adviser and then a top staffer
with the Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The levels of anxiety were high, and the liberal position was
the freeze,'' said Peter Knight, a top aide at the time. ``He was
looking for a more complete answer.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, with a major speech and an article in The New Republic,
one of his many essays and op-ed articles on the issue, Gore came
forth with his answer: an arms control strategy that would move
from big multiple-warhead missiles to smaller single-warhead
missiles, which could be easily scattered and thus much harder to
target, thereby reducing the advantage of a first strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a high like you've never seen,'' Kopp recalled. ``He
proved to himself and to people who didn't know him that he could
get up to speed on an issue that people thought was untouchable,
and he went through that course in record time with flying colors.
He also thought he might have really found the key to unlocking the
Iron Curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, when the Reagan administration was trying to win
congressional approval for the big multiple-warhead MX missile,
Gore and like-minded colleagues sought a compromise: limited
deployment of the MX, development of the smaller single-warhead
Midgetman missile and a new push toward arms control. In the end,
when the Midgetman went undeveloped but the MX pushed ahead, some
Democrats thought Gore and his allies had been used; others praised
their search for a new path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a black and white thing,'' said Michael Krepon,
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an international-security
policy group. ``If you take a longer-range view, the outcome that
Gore was pushing _ take the warheads off these land-based missiles,
that single-warhead missiles are the route to stability on land _
what Gore was pushing for became conventional wisdom 15 years
later.''
</P>
<P>
   What was clear was that Gore was playing at a very high level of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   `A RAGING MODERATE'
</P>
<P>
   Even as he became a more prominent national figure, doing the
Sunday talk shows and finding his name in assessments of
presidential timber, Gore was careful to return to Tennessee
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   His father's painful defeat by Bill Brock had provided the great
political lesson of his life. As the Republicans gained a foothold
in the South, the senior Gore became vulnerable because he had
opposed the Vietnam War, supported civil rights (for the most part)
and become a Washington fixture who did not go home much. The
younger Gore would not make the same mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He started as a freshman, making the trip every weekend, driving
maniacally down country roads in a Dodge Omni, staying for an hour
or so regardless of whether he was speaking to 50 people or to
five. ``Whenever two or three people got together, Al would be
there,'' said former Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee, who served with
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One minute Gore would be jotting down the name of an elderly
woman who needed help with her Social Security check. The next he
would be using coffee-cup missiles to explain his arms control
proposals. Those who watched him then said he seemed far more
natural than he does now.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings served him well when he had to cast tough votes, as
he did against President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts. ``People were
standing up and saying you better vote for this, and Al would just
talk about why he thought it was a bad idea,'' said Steve Owens, an
early House aide. ``It proved his theory that if you came back
enough and made yourself accountable, people would understand even
if you disagree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that he could, Gore minimized opportunities for
disagreement. In line with his district, he opposed both Medicaid
financing of abortion and most forms of gun control, positions that
he changed as he felt the lure of national politics. ``There's no
doubt that I changed my position,'' he said, but he noted that many
Democrats had evolved on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, Gore had no interest in leading on divisive
topics. ``On the abortion stuff, he was never out front,'' said
former Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., a member of the class of '76.
``I never noticed how he voted. He did it quietly. I was surprised
to read that he had ever been anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore called himself ``a raging moderate,'' and it worked. After
a close first election, He ran unopposed in 1978, won with 79
percent in 1980 and was unopposed again in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed almost preordained, when Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn.,
announced his intention to retire, that Gore would take his seat.
But Gore did not find the easy fit in the Senate that he had found
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He was young for a senator, 36, and entering an institution
where seniority mattered, deeply. He had been chairman of a
subcommittee in the House, but now he was a junior member of his
committees, including Commerce and, eventually, Armed Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to dinner one night at a restaurant on the Hill, and
he was talking about his frustrations, trying to figure out ways to
get back involved in environmental issues,'' Owens recalled. ``In
the middle of it, he just looks at me and says, `You know,
sometimes I wonder if this was such a smart idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did find a way to pursue his interests. He played a major
role in probing NASA after the Challenger disaster in 1986. He was
an early voice warning about the dangers of global warming. He
worked on legislation that promoted high-performance computing and
networking projects, and was an early champion of the Internet.
(Gore steps carefully around that accomplishment today, after
overstating his role last year.) He maintained a high profile in
national security matters, serving as a member, for example, of a
Senate observer group for arms control talks in Geneva in 1985. And
he continued his tutorials on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   But his tenure in the Senate was framed by two presidential
campaigns _ the one he conducted in 1988 and the one that many
expected him to conduct in 1992. His opponents argued that as his
national ambitions grew, his hunger for the spotlight was
all-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't show up in legislating, like Kennedy or the people I
dealt with,'' said Simpson. ``He showed up in the news cycle.''
Critics saw political calculations everywhere during Gore's Senate
years _ including his decision to break with his party and vote to
authorize President Bush to wage war on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described his vote _ he was one of 10 Democrats to vote to
authorize the Persian Gulf War _ as ``excruciatingly difficult,''
indeed the toughest of his career. He dismissed those who viewed it
as a political vote, saying that in fact it jeopardized his ability
to win Democratic presidential primaries. ``It was anything but a
political vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simpson asserts that Gore bargained with the Republicans
over how much speaking time he would get _ and when _ before he
made his decision, an assertion dismissed by the Gore campaign and
other Democrats. George Mitchell, the majority leader at the time,
scoffed: ``They've been trying to peddle that for eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote that seemed so politically dangerous at the time proved
highly auspicious for Gore's political future, with the Gulf War
considered a resounding military success. But as the 1992 election
approached, it seemed ever more apparent to Gore's aides that he
would not run, at least not at the top of the ticket. He focused
more and more on favorite issues _ notably global warming _ that
had proven so hard to translate into a presidential campaign agenda
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed in myself in '88,'' Gore said, ``by the
extent to which I responded to the deafening silence on those
issues by muting my own discussion of them and shifting into sort
of cookie-cutter issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, congressional scholars say, Gore's time in Congress
will be remembered for his persistence on those issues. ``If you
were to pick the master coalition builders in Congress, Al Gore
wouldn't be on that list,'' said Norman J. Ornstein, an expert on
Congress at the American Enterprise Institute. ``But if you were to
pick the master agenda setters, he definitely would.''
</P>
<P>
   This much was clear, though: By the time Bill Clinton called, Al
Gore had broken from the pack.

   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories _ With tee-off times set for
midnight, the summer solstice golf tournament was fast approaching
when Rebecca Jaud faced an increasingly familiar problem for this
Arctic city: no rooms at the inns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was calling bed and breakfast operators to see if they could
loan camping equipment so tourists could sleep in their
backyards,'' said Jaud, who runs this city's increasingly busy
visitors center. During the first half of this year, she estimated,
Yellowknife's hotels were sold out ``15 to 20 nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellowknife, on the northern tip of Great Slave Lake, has
traditionally been the Saturday night destination of choice for fur
trappers, gold miners and lonely Mounties.
</P>
<P>
   But as evidenced by two new hotels nearing completion here, a
new sushi restaurant with Japanese-speaking staff, and travel
advertisements fattening Up Here magazine, Yellowknife and Canada's
north are undergoing a tourism boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just crazy with Europeans,'' Darielle Talarico, manager
of Go Wild Tours, said in Inuvik, a town above the Arctic Circle,
as she prepared to send another group of visitors down the Dempster
Highway to Whitehorse, 1,000 miles to the south. This summer,
weekly flights link Zurich and Frankfurt with Whitehorse, capital
of the Yukon Territory, where tourism has become the No. 1 economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Although Germans flood the Yukon, French flock to Nunavut and
10,000 Japanese tourists come to Yellowknife every winter to view
the northern lights, Canada's northern tourism boom is largely
fueled by Americans, who account for about three-quarters of the
nation's foreign visitors every year.
</P>
<P>
   Much as affluent Americans migrate south in the winter to escape
the cold, more and more Americans now migrate north in the summer
to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal in 1998, more Americans made overnight trips to
Canada than Canadians made overnight trips to the United States.
With northern tourism growing faster than southern tourism,
American overnight trips to Canada increased by 24 percent in the
1990s, hitting 15.2 million last year, while American trips to
Mexico grew by 14 percent during the decade, hitting 18.3 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Canada rose to 8th place from 11th in the ranking
of popular world travel destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are lured by the Canadian dollar, which lingers
near historically low levels. But while they may find good prices
on their summer trip, they still find that coming north does not
necessarily mean an escape from global warming. In mid-July,
air-conditioners were going full blast in this city, 275 miles
south of the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Edmonton it was so hot we had to put things under the
kickstands so the bikes wouldn't sink into the asphalt,'' said
Lloyd Schaffer, a retired computer systems analyst who motorcycled
here from Waterloo, Iowa, with a friend. ``We love Canada. The
people are so friendly. The prices are good up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's three northern territories, home to only 100,000 people
sprinkled across 1.5 million square miles, have traditionally been
seen as a preserve of the Indiana Jones adventure traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with good hotels in every major town and increasingly
reliable, if expensive, air links, it is often older and more
affluent tourists who can be found in northern restaurants,
ordering bowls of caribou stew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it so much that we are going next year on a Russian
icebreaker, from Churchill in the Hudson Bay to Greenland,'' said
Sam Wagonfeld, a retired Denver child psychologist, after spending
a week in July touring Eskimo villages and archaeological sites
with his wife, Sally Allen. The five members of the tour group, who
flew around Nunavut, Canada's new eastern Arctic territory, were
all in their 60s.
</P>
<P>
   For years, one of North America's most fabled drives was the
Dempster Highway, the world's only all-weather road that crosses
the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have five children,'' Betty Veitch, a retired Ontario
schoolteacher, said as she settled into a dinner theater in Inuvik.
``As soon as they heard what I was planning, they said, `Go for
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Inuvik, where dust-covered vans and recreational vehicles
line the main street, the visitors center now receives 6,000
visitors a year, largely in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the accessible Arctic,'' said Dennis Zimmerman,
manager of Arctic Nature Tours, an agency owned by the indigenous
Inuvialuit people. ``Mom and pop can go to the Arctic.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yellowknife, where two stuffed polar bears adorn the airport
terminal, arriving visitors often say they are surprised by the
amenities offered by this territorial capital of 18,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Symington, who moved here from Hong Kong to manage the
Explorer, the city's largest hotel, said, ``People say: `You've got
a city here, high-rise buildings. We thought you would be living
out of trailers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Lavigne, publisher of Up Here, which appears eight times
a year, has watched the travel portion of her advertising climb to
60 percent. Noting that hotel rooms are to increase here by
one-third this fall, she added, ``For a town that had zero bed and
breakfasts five years ago, we now how have 20 or 30.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic freshman class that was elected to
the House of Representatives in 1976 was a remarkable one, loaded
with bright and ambitious young reformers who blended the idealism
of their generation with the cynicism bred by Watergate and
Vietnam. Many would go on to bigger things.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this hotbed of ambition, Al Gore stood out. As
former Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee put it, ``Al was never a
backbencher.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as they arrived on Capitol Hill, members of the
class of '76 began looking for ways to break out of the pack. Some,
like Dick Gephardt, played the inside game, building the personal
alliances essential for rising in congressional leadership. Others,
like Gore, a young Tennessean with a famous political name,
preferred the outside game.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his way to twist arms or trade favors. While he made
friends, particularly on the basketball court in the House gym,
backslapping was not his political strong suit. Instead, Gore, who
was 28 when first elected, went methodically about the task of
identifying issues _ many slightly obscure but all deadly serious _
that he could make his own.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 16 years in Congress, Gore was strikingly
effective at winning attention by championing just-over-the-horizon
consumer-oriented causes. Toxic-waste dumping. Genetic testing.
Global warming.
</P>
<P>
   He reveled in the details, in mastering the arcana of arms
control or computer technology, issues the average politician might
find bloodless or simply too hard, then trying to popularize those
issues with the voters at large.
</P>
<P>
   So effective was his strategy, and so media-savvy his approach,
that former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, once the No. 2 Republican
in the Senate, remembered: ``We called him Prime Time Al. That's
what he was known as in our cloakroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore's record on Capitol Hill remains a vital part of his
biography. And the debate over whether its hallmark was prescience
or political expedience will rage over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategists say most Americans are unaware of how
Gore spent the years 1977 to 1992 and they plan to highlight that
era in convention speeches and films. ``Gore throughout his career
has taken on important issues well before it was fashionable to
take them on,'' said Mark Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager
for communications.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign will portray Gore as a man who carefully
crafted his congressional career to maintain his political
viability, a man with little grounding other than his own ambition.
``Al Gore's flip-flops on important issues, including guns and
abortion, underscore why there's a leadership gap in this
campaign,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was engaged in a balancing act for much of his
congressional career. He chose issues that pushed him to the
national stage, but he was compulsive about tending his district
back home. He studiously avoided the kind of polarizing debates
that contributed to the electoral defeat of his father, Sen. Albert
Gore Sr., in 1970. The issues the younger Gore selected had the
advantage of being virtually nonideological. There was right and
wrong in Gore's positioning, but rarely was there right and left.
</P>
<P>
   On the most volatile controversies, like abortion and gun
control, he took stands that put his conservative constituents at
ease and then shifted positions as he moved from Tennessee politics
to the national arena. To the extent he ever alienated the home
folks, he usually managed to work his way back into their good
graces by maintaining a relentless regimen of town hall meetings,
sometimes five on a given Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It all left his political rivals with little room to maneuver.
``He picked out issues that unless Adolf Hitler was your idol you
couldn't disagree,'' said Victor H. Ashe, the mayor of Knoxville,
Tenn., and Gore's Republican opponent in his first Senate campaign
in 1984. ``Organ transplant databases. More money for Alzheimer's
research. Infant formula. I mean, who in their right mind is going
to fight against those? He avoided any issue that could be
divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ideological ratings by groups that monitor congressional
voting records typically group him as a centrist Democrat,
particularly on foreign policy, with positions that grew somewhat
more liberal as he moved toward his failed 1988 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic freshmen who entered the House in the
post-Watergate classes of 1974 and 1976 expected to make a
difference, fast, in contrast with their predecessors' long years
of quiet back-bench servitude. Gore hoped to be on the
Appropriations Committee, the seat of federal largess, but he
landed, fortunately enough, on the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Commerce Committee had purview over a wide array of
consumer issues _ involving energy, the environment, health care _
and it gave Gore an invaluable forum. He got a seat on the
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and eventually became
chairman of a similar subcommittee of the House Committee on
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   From those perches, Gore quickly became known as a meticulously
prepared, take-no-prisoners inquisitor, aided by his background in
law and his five years as a newspaper reporter. Headlines from
Tennessee _ and some in Washington _ portrayed an aggressive young
lawmaker standing up for consumers, whether he was charging
monopoly practices among natural-gas pipeline companies or exposing
an international uranium cartel:
</P>
<P>
   It was a pattern that would continue over the years as he
crusaded against the marketing of unhealthy baby formula, raised
early ethical concerns about the use of genetic testing and
engineering, promoted the benefits of midwifery and helped
establish a national organ transplant network.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, Gore would become the butt of late-night talk show
jokes for his claim of having helped to create the Internet. But
congressional colleagues say he really was ahead of the curve in
seeing the implications of new technologies, like computer networks
and genetic testing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could be a demanding, micromanaging boss, traits that have
extended to his campaign. In his early days, he sorted the office
mail himself and insisted on reviewing and editing the most
pedestrian constituent letters. Former aides said he did not take
well to criticism and was not particularly solicitous of advice
from underlings. Though he was accessible, he avoided both small
talk and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his tenure in the House, at the start of the
1980s, Gore began his move to a more national arena, obtaining a
seat on the House Intelligence Committee and plunging into the most
arcane field in Washington: arms control. It has become a highly
burnished chapter in the official Gore story _ how he heard the
persistent fears of nuclear war from the folks back home, how he
embarked on a secretive yearlong tutorial on arms control with Leon
Fuerth, today his national security adviser and then a top staffer
with the Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, with a major speech and an article in The New Republic,
one of his many essays and op-ed articles on the issue, Gore came
forth with his answer: an arms control strategy that would move
from big multiple-warhead missiles to smaller single-warhead
missiles, which could be easily scattered and thus much harder to
target, thereby reducing the advantage of a first strike.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, when the Reagan administration was trying to win
congressional approval for the big multiple-warhead MX missile,
Gore and like-minded colleagues sought a compromise: limited
deployment of the MX, development of the smaller single-warhead
Midgetman missile and a new push toward arms control. In the end,
when the Midgetman went undeveloped but the MX pushed ahead, some
Democrats thought Gore and his allies had been used; others praised
their search for a new path.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that he could, Gore minimized opportunities for
disagreement. In line with his district, he opposed both Medicaid
financing of abortion and most forms of gun control, positions that
he changed as he felt the lure of national politics. ``There's no
doubt that I changed my position,'' he said, but he noted that many
Democrats had evolved on such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called himself ``a raging moderate,'' and it worked. After
a close first election, He ran unopposed in 1978, won with 79
percent in 1980 and was unopposed again in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed almost preordained, when Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn.,
announced his intention to retire, that Gore would take his seat.
But Gore did not find the easy fit in the Senate that he had found
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He was young for a senator, 36, and entering an institution
where seniority mattered, deeply. He had been chairman of a
subcommittee in the House, but now he was a junior member of his
committees, including Commerce and, eventually, Armed Services.
</P>
<P>
   He did find a way to pursue his interests. He played a major
role in probing NASA after the Challenger disaster in 1986. He was
an early voice warning about the dangers of global warming. He
worked on legislation that promoted high-performance computing and
networking projects, and was an early champion of the Internet. He
maintained a high profile in national security matters, serving as
a member of a Senate observer group for arms control talks in
Geneva in 1985. And he continued his tutorials on various issues.
</P>
<P>
   But his tenure in the Senate was framed by two presidential
campaigns _ the one he conducted in 1988 and the one that many
expected him to conduct in 1992. His opponents argued that as his
national ambitions grew, his hunger for the spotlight was
all-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't show up in legislating, like Kennedy or the people I
dealt with,'' said Simpson. ``He showed up in the news cycle.''
Critics saw political calculations everywhere in Gore's Senate
years _ including his decision to break with his party and vote to
authorize President Bush to wage war on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described his vote _ he was one of 10 Democrats to vote to
authorize the Persian Gulf War _ as ``excruciatingly difficult,''
indeed the toughest of his career. He dismissed those who viewed it
as a political vote, saying that in fact it jeopardized his ability
to win Democratic presidential primaries. ``It was anything but a
political vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional scholars say that Gore's time in Congress will be
remembered for his persistence on favorite issues. ``If you were to
pick the master coalition builders in Congress, Al Gore wouldn't be
on that list,'' said Norman J. Ornstein, an expert on Congress at
the American Enterprise Institute. ``But if you were to pick the
master agenda setters, he definitely would.''
</P>
<P>
   This much was clear, though: By the time Bill Clinton called, Al
Gore had broken from the pack.

VANITY RULES: FOR VENEZUELANS, LOOKING GOOD IS THE BEST REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ It has always been an open secret here,
though one that is not supposed to be shared with outsiders. So
when a recent consumer survey of 30 countries concluded that
Venezuelans, men and women alike, were the most vain people in the
world, the results were considered a bit embarrassing, but hardly
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it is true,'' said Marga Bermudez, a salesclerk in a
busy beauty products store at a shopping center in a middle-class
area here. ``How could it be otherwise? Ours is a country renowned
for its beauty queens, and so we are always, always worrying about
our appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether gauged by President Hugo Chavez extolling the comeliness
of the Venezuelan woman in speeches or the magazines that trace the
careers of the growing number of Venezuelan male models who are
achieving success abroad, this is a society that sets an
extraordinary stock on looking good. Rich and poor, women and men,
young and old _ all are expected to make themselves as attractive
as possible, no matter what the cost to their pocketbook or body.
</P>
<P>
   According to the market research study, 65 percent of Venezuelan
women and 47 percent of men admitted that they think about their
looks ``all the time.'' Russian women, at 51 percent, and Mexican
men, 40 percent, finished second in the survey, conducted last year
by Roper Starch Worldwide, while just 27 percent of American women
and 17 percent of American men were recorded as saying that their
appearance was always on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   To Osmel Sousa, those findings merely prove that Venezuelans
have more discerning tastes than other mortals. Sousa may well be
in a position to know. As director of the Miss Venezuela pageant he
is ``the Pygmalion of our national mythology,'' in the words of the
sociologist Tulio Hernandez, and the one person most responsible
for establishing the ideals of physical attractiveness for which
Venezuelans aim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find vain people everywhere, but I don't think the
Venezuelan people as a whole are especially vain,'' he said in an
interview here, cutting a dapper figure himself in a white suit and
white shoes. ``What you have here is people paying a lot of
attention to and investing a lot of effort in their personal
appearance, in looking good and dressing well. We're not vain here
so much as we are lovers of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the effort to cultivate an attractive exterior
seems to go to unusual lengths here, compared even to other Latin
American countries that have a narcissistic image, such as Brazil
or Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the election, I had to work until midnight,''
recalled Souky Villalobos, a 25-year-old hairdresser who works at a
chic upscale salon, referring to the July 30 presidential vote
here. ``My customers knew that they were going to have to stand in
line for several hours to vote the next day, and they wanted to
make sure they looked good while they were waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the country's vast oil wealth, more than 80 percent of
Venezuela's population of 23 million people continue to live below
the poverty line. Yet when it comes to looking their best, there
seems to be little difference between the rich, and the much
poorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Board a bus even in the most humble of neighborhoods, and it
reeks of perfume,'' said Gladys Duque Cabrera, a hairdresser in
Catia, a working-class area here. ``Venezuelans would rather not
eat than not look elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, market researchers here estimate that the average
Venezuelan household spends a fifth of its income on personal care
and grooming products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Venezuelan economy contracted by more than 7
percent as a result of the worst recession in years, but while
sales of some basic foodstuffs fell, several companies actually
reported increases in sales of cosmetics and similar products.
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are bad, you want to look good,'' explained Alberto
Armas Crespo, a construction worker, showing a reporter the cologne
he carries in his lunch box. ``Otherwise where is the fun in
living?''
</P>
<P>
   Many reasons have been offered to explain why the cult of beauty
is more intense here than elsewhere. More often than not, the
explanations end up focusing on the longstanding national obsession
with beauty pageants and the distraction they provide from a host
of social and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   As Hernandez sees it, ``the apprenticeship process'' of being
obsessed with one's personal appearance ``begins at the most tender
of young ages, with the election of a Carnival queen in every
classroom of every school.'' Sports teams, private clubs, and
professional associations also elect their beauty queens, not to
mention ``neighborhood, city and state fairs and festivals,'' he
added, and even the occasional women's prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we bear a bit of the blame,'' Sousa conceded. The beauty
contest, he said, ``sets standards of how to look good and
encourages the public to rate the girls in terms of their
attractiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a ``Mr. Venezuela'' pageant has also become
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our women are so beautiful that you are in danger of being
overshadowed when you are standing alongside them,'' said Alejandro
Otamendi, a 25-year-old security guard. ``So yes, it is only
natural that men should also paying more attention to the way they
look.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent museum exhibition here brought the national fascination
with beauty under critical scrutiny. Called ``90-60-90,'' the
metric equivalent of the 36-24-36 figure that is considered to be
the feminine ideal here, it drew record crowds to see items that
included photographs of ``Miss Cloaca,'' a contestant in an
imaginary ``alternative'' Miss Venezuela pageant, as well as a work
made from the fat extracted from liposuction operations.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the display of the four Miss Universe and five Miss
World crowns won by Venezuelan beauty queens that seemed to most
fascinate the public. ``To the extent that the country sinks into
poverty and violence,'' Alfons Hug, a curator, told the daily El
Nacional when the show opened in May, ``the star of the Miss rises
higher, shines brighter and gains importance in society.''

U.N. CRITICIZES LACK OF HELP BY LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Lebanon's very limited deployment of soldiers
and police into the south, far from stabilizing the situation along
its border with Israel, is raising new uncertainties 10 weeks after
Israel ended its 22-year occupation of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weeks of international diplomatic pressure to do so, the
Lebanese pointedly did not put their forces on the border when they
finally sent them in on Wednesday. This has now drawn a rebuke from
U.N. peacekeepers on the ground, who are hinting that their mission
_ begun in 1978 _ could end when its latest mandate expires in six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Border security is essentially the responsibility of the state
of Lebanon,'' said Timor Goksel, the spokesman for the U.N.
soldiers, who fanned out in force along the border a week ago.
``This is a national, not international duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The border has been quiet except for daily rock-throwing into
Israel at the old Fatma Gate, a major tourist attraction that is
increasingly annoying to the Israelis. Three Lebanese, including
two journalists, were wounded by Israeli gunfire in an incident
last week when a man on the Lebanese side lit and threw a Molotov
cocktail over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The various forces now in the area include 1,000 Lebanese
soldiers and police, the hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers, Hezbollah
guerrillas maintaining their own observation posts and _ on the
other side of the frontier _ Israeli troops putting up new border
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's refusal to have its forces go all the way to the
border is widely seen here as a move by Syria, which has virtually
controlled Lebanon for a decade, to maintain pressure on Israel to
return the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving control of the border uncertain, this line of
reasoning goes, Syria reserved the threat of possible future action
by Hezbollah, or other proxies, such as Syrian-based Palestinian
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government says it will only deploy its troops on
the border in the context of a complete regional peace agreement,
including the turnover of the Golan Heights, conquered by Israel in
1967, and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   International donors have insisted on the dispatch of government
troops to the south. Lebanon has said it sent its forces into the
border region only to keep peace among local Shiite Muslims and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The task force ``is responsible for law and order,'' Lebanon's
interior minister Michel Murr told reporters, ``and not on the
border with Israel. The border is not our concern at this stage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has also told the U.N. peacekeepers not
to set up at what had been border crossing points. Nepalese
soldiers in the U.N. force were withdrawn from one such crossing.
U.N. officials say privately that they suspect that the orders not
to watch these points originated with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has repeatedly complained to the United Nations about the
Fatma Gate, where Hezbollah has deposited piles of rocks at
designated stoning points.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli chief of staff, Gen. Shaul Mofaz, warned that
``Israeli soldiers know how to behave'' if attacked, and deputy
defense minister Ephraim Sneh accused the peacekeepers of failing
to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Hezbollah official, deputy secretary general Naim
Qassem, described the stone throwing as ``a way for the Lebanese to
express their rejection of the occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he dismissed the complaints to the United
Nations. Israel, ``which has not succeeded in getting guarantees
from the Lebanese state _ despite pressures, particularly from the
Americans _ is trying to snatch up guarantees when and where it
can,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, U.N. officials are said to be sharply
pointing out to the Lebanese that the Security Council resolution
that authorized and extended the peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon, known as Unifil, also calls on the Lebanese government to
extend its authority throughout the region and ``proceed with a
significant deployment of the Lebanese armed forces as soon as
possible.'' The latest resolution, passed on July 27, also looks
forward to phasing out Unifil and replacing it with a presumably
smaller group of observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Lebanese seem to be unaware of is that Unifil's end
is near,'' a U.N. official said. ``Lebanon can't go on indefinitely
ignoring its responsibility for the border and the border region
alike.''

   BEL AIR, Md. _ Every minor leaguer has a major league dream.
This is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner's plane, en route from Tampa, Fla., to New
York, is forced to land at the tiny Harford County airport near
here. Impatient, feeling baseball-deprived, the Boss dials the
radio until he lands at the tiny community station, WHFC-FM 91.1.
He is mesmerized by the local game he hears, the quickness, depth,
savvy, desire, the power to use the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   He growls at an assistant, ``Who is that guy and why isn't he at
Yankee Stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   That guy, the dreamer, is Neal Conan, the 50-year-old rookie
play-by-play announcer of the Aberdeen Arsenal, a first-year
expansion club in the independent Atlantic League. Like Conan, the
players are not kids, most of them struggling to be rediscovered
after being cut from major league farm teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Conan, who gets to dream out loud, has had 23 years in the
major leagues, as an executive producer, a host, a prize-winning
foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, from which he is
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, while preparing for a live broadcast from the
Democratic convention in Chicago, his attention was caught by the
Cubs' broadcasters on his hotel television. He thought: That isn't
so different, I can do it. He began taping play-by-plays in front
of a silent TV screen. For the past three seasons, he moonlighted
as the part-time second voice of the Bowie Baysox.
</P>
<P>
   And on the night of Aug. 5, he was climbing the metal ladder to
the roof of the tiny press box at the tiny home field of the local
community college. An old friend, me, handed up his cables, mikes,
headset, Comrex Hotline, Shure mixer, Sony DAT recorder, all of
which, he explained, will ``squirt the broadcast signal down a
telephone line from the ballpark to the radio station'' and back
out to an unknown number of listeners, including Conan.
</P>
<P>
   He broadcasts with the backfeed echoing in his ears; it is the
only way he can be sure he is really on the air. Because his cell
phone is a different area code from the station's, he is not sure
that someone there will call long distance if there is a problem.
If indeed there is someone there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this,'' I said, minutes before the game, ``seems like a
midlife crisis to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said Conan, cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   He paced the press box roof, waiting to begin his pre-game show
with a taped interview. He had melted Maleke Fowler's reserve by
dubbing the 25-year-old outfielder ``the discourager'' for having
hit a leadoff home run in the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discourager,'' I sneered. ``Talk about ingratiating
yourself with a subject. Did you call Saddam Hussein `the heavy
hitter?' Some Bosnian jackal `the cleanup man?'''

   Conan, who was captured and held for a week by the Iraqis while
covering the Iran-Iraq war nine years ago, smiled serenely through
a graying red beard. ``It's true, I never said, `What a great
ambush.' Reportorial detachment is good, but it's nice to finally
be for something. I want these guys to win, to do well. I got
rushes covering wars and political conventions and the impeachment
hearings, but this is all by myself, filling three hours on the
radio, feeling really alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Conan screamed into his phone: ``Why aren't we on the
air? It's Neal. Pick up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the first Lehigh Valley Black Diamond was at
the plate that the connection was made and Conan was alive again.
It was easy to imagine his clear, dryly friendly voice in a larger
market. His delivery is crisp, seamless and authoritative, if a
little forgiving; he tends to excuse overrun pop flies as lost in
the late-evening shadows. But there is no false enthusiasm and no
irony. He has also learned that it is one thing to inform listeners
that the 26-year-old pitcher Zac Stark read Updike and Hesse on the
last bus trip, another to extol someone's wife and kids back home
when that someone is dating locally.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``family entertainment'' as much as it is organized
baseball. Independent league teams, with no responsibility to
develop players, can concentrate on winning games and profitably
building a community audience. Seats are $12 and $8 (children under
5 and in Little League uniforms are free). Cal Ripken Jr., who was
raised in nearby Aberdeen, is part owner of the club and is
building a fancy ballpark with a baseball academy attached.
</P>
<P>
   Conan is thinking bigger, too; commentaries on his minor league
life are broadcast every other Friday on NPR's ``Morning Edition''
and will fuel a book, entitled ``Play by Play.'' That might get
Steinbrenner's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still the bushes and far from home. His two
college-age children and wife, Liane Hansen, an NPR anchor, live
outside Washington, too far to commute. She says he looks 10 years
younger, and he says he is happy, but he has had twinges as the
political season heated up. Was he doing the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' Conan said, ``a fan asked me to sign his glove.
That never happened at a convention.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TICKET TOO HIGH? CALL IT THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paid $37 to park my car in Manhattan the other night.
Was there only three hours, but should have left the car to
rationalize the overnight fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dope,'' some people are saying. ``It's your own fault for
driving in Manhattan. You get what you deserve in life.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but normally I jockey into spaces on the street and only
in desperation do I go for a garage. When did parking soar from $20
to $37 on Amsterdam and 75th?
</P>
<P>
   A price like that can make you feel you don't belong in your own
city anymore. Yet the garage was full, and the restaurants were
busy on a Wednesday night, and up at Yankee Stadium, there was a
crowd of 33,466 paying customers. Who can afford these pleasures?
</P>
<P>
   ``Merchants are hiking prices because they recognize that these
days many New Yorkers have more disposable income,'' notes Peter
Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the truth is, too many New Yorkers can't afford to have a
good time,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Not if a good time is defined as a casual night at the arena. In
the age of the $37 parking fee, the dreadfully selfish athletes are
up to nine-digit salaries, spread over a few years. This forces the
wonderfully benevolent owners to raise ticket prices _ as gently as
possible, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone claims that sports tickets have risen faster than any
other form of entertainment in the past five years, and backs it up
with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' highest ticket _ not including season ticket plans _
has risen from $45 to $220 since 1995, which, adjusted for
inflation, amounts to a leap of 335.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in the world can afford that?'' Vallone asked. ``The fans
are the ones who made the Knicks, but now they can't see the Knicks
in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Depends on your definition of fan. Somebody must be able to
afford to watch the Knicks, since they have sold out Madison Square
Garden for 347 straight games, since John Starks was a lad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these are corporate seats,'' Vallone said. ``You have
a wealthy class of people who buy these tickets for business
purposes. There's nothing left for the middle class. The taxi
driver can't buy four seats to the Knicks.''
</P>
<P>
   These populist sentiments from Vallone, a Democrat from Queens,
just might have something to do with his mayoral aspirations. He
made his original comments directly in front of the Garden, which,
as you might imagine, has its corporate response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning teams and top-rated productions are very expensive to
produce,'' said the Garden's president, Dave Checketts, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden is not the only sports outfit to raise prices.
Yankees bleacher seats have jumped only 18.69 percent since 1995
while their highest tickets have jumped 110.19 percent. The Mets'
lowest tickets have jumped 64.38 percent and their highest have
gone up 119.58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Open, prices have risen only 1.29 percent for the
cheaper tickets in the first week. The modest rise can be explained
by these seats being in the lunar reaches of Ashe Stadium, so
remote that ticket-holders abandon them to actually see a tennis
match.
</P>
<P>
   At the Open, the more expensive seats have jumped 127.31
percent, below the ghost town of the luxury boxes. (All these
percentages were adjusted for inflation.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Staten Island Ferry has gone from 50 cents to
free _ ``the best deal in town,'' Vallone called it _ seagulls and
salt spray instead of the cacophonous drivel of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has an apocalyptic vision in which the average fan will
lose visceral contact with the players, and the passion for sport
will die. He wishes the office of council speaker, or the mayor,
had more muscle, but he said that when he complains of gouging in
other areas, ``the heads of banks come to my office.'' The line
forms on the right for team owners willing to be scolded by the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   For all the gouging, the evidence is that people still feel
connected with their teams. A fascinating article by James C.
McKinley Jr. in Friday's New York Times suggests that fans may
actually be healthier and happier than people with no sporting
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, fretting over Patrick Ewing's court vision has
the same function as caring for a fuzzy pet _ therapy at $220 a
pop.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to tell fans to get over it, that it's just a
game, but psychologists say that male and female fans undergo
hormonal surges based on the wayward roll of a ball.
</P>
<P>
   For example: When poor old Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio both
missed penalty kicks to decide the scoreless tie in the 1994 World
Cup final between Italy and Brazil, the measurable testosterone
level in a small sample of Brazilian men went up by 28 percent
while the level in a sample of Italian men went down by 27 percent.
(There's plenty to spare, but still _ 27 percent?)
</P>
<P>
   So remember: When you see Florida fans lurching away in their
Winnebagos after a bad autumn afternoon at Florida State, or Red
Sox fans dying yet another death in Fenway Park, think of the
downward spiral of testosterone level, matched only by the upward
spiral of ticket prices _ going together like a masochist's dream.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN CHAMULA, Mexico _ This rugged part of Chiapas State has
been the eye of a human storm that has raged on much longer than
the better-known struggle of the Zapatista rebels who have been
fighting Mexican authorities for six years.
</P>
<P>
   It has been ground zero in Mexico's lingering conflict between
Catholics and Evangelical Christians. The battles, often pitting
Indians determined to preserve traditional customs against those
who want change, have blazed on for 30 years, dividing fathers from
their sons, turning violent, and leaving hundreds dead and at least
30,000 displaced in Chiapas alone.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be changing. Nestled in a field turned green with
young cabbage and corn is an extraordinary monument of
determination _ perhaps even tolerance _ signaling what could be a
beginning to the end of those religious tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The building is little more than a shell, with unfinished
concrete walls, a flat roof and gaping holes where there will one
day be windows. When completed, however, it will be the area's
first Evangelical church.
</P>
<P>
   The church, the Prince of Peace Temple, is being built with
donations that have trickled in from Evangelical groups across the
country. And although the drab, gray hull will not be completed
until sometime next year, it is already a house of worship.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday mornings, its bare sanctuary _ furnished only with
handmade benches and a folding table for an altar _ fills with
color and life. As the worshipers arrive, they are greeted by music
from an electric keyboard that sounds like it might introduce an
American hymn, until the soloist begins singing in Tzozil, the
language of the Chamulans.
</P>
<P>
   Men with creased faces gather on one side. And as the songs
intensify, they fall to their knees and shout ``Glory to God.''
Women sitting on the other side rise and dance through the aisles
with tambourines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to heaven with Jesus,'' they rejoice in their
songs. ``So powerful is our God.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene of joyful celebration belies the dangers that have
loomed around the church, where religious conflict has set off
local wars. Catholic villages have been terrorized by paramilitary
groups in recent years, and Evangelicals have long been driven out
of their homes and off their land.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, say officials of the National Commission of
Human Rights, 98 Chamulan Evangelicals were forcibly expelled from
a village less than a mile away from the Prince of Peace Temple by
Catholics who burned houses and threatened children who tried to
attend the local school.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vicious phenomenon that has existed across Latin America
since the 1960s, when waves of fundamentalist Evangelicals began to
win large numbers of converts from Catholic flocks, numbers that
continue to grow even today.
</P>
<P>
   There are religious refugees among the Huichols in Jalisco and
the Zapotecs in Oaxaca, said Arturo Farela Gutierrez of the
National Fraternity of Evangelical Christian Churches. But the
greatest numbers are in Chiapas, a state where 70 percent of the
population are indigenous people and where religions exist in
greater variety than just about anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a half of those fleeing religious persecution in Chiapas
are Evangelicals from San Juan Chamula. The municipality of 40,000
people is known around the world for its fierce devotion to its
religion, a mix of Catholicism and pre-Hispanic beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it was important to build a church in Chamula because
that is where most of the blood has been spilled,'' Farela said.
``For us, the Prince of Peace Temple is the most important new
church in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The tide of Evangelicals, however, has begun to turn. In 1996,
more than 2,000 Evangelical exiles returned to San Juan Chamula in
a huge human caravan and began work on the new church. Most of
those expelled in June have also returned, thanks to government
negotiated peace treaties, human rights officials said,
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this has been a great struggle,'' said Marcelino Cruz
Patishtan, the 25-year-old pastor at Prince of Peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to return,'' he said. ``We decided to do it, no matter
what. God gave us this life, and we believe that he will protect
us.''  &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of those who returned, Manuel Perez Gomez, said his house
had been fired on nine times in the last five years. The walls, he
said, are still pocked with bullet holes _ 75 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor his wife and eight children were wounded, but
there are psychological scars, he said. And they seem to open when
Perez talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I need to go out to my fields because we need food,''
said Perez, who farms corn. ``But I am afraid. What if there is
another shooting? Who will pay for my life? My wife and children
will be crying. Who will take care of them?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Catholics, they seem to have begun a grudging
acceptance of the growing Evangelical congregation in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that we used to expel them,'' said Mario Hernandez
Jimenez, 58, a Catholic leader and elementary school teacher. ``But
not anymore. We give them total liberty _ and they still provoke
problems by going to human rights groups and saying bad things
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics worship in a church in the main plaza of San Juan
Chamula, across the highway from the Evangelical communities.
Theirs is a plain, rustic structure whose height and fresh white
paint make it stand out amid the squalor of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, there are no pews. Worshipers kneel on a
carpet of pine needles. They stand candles on the floor in front of
them and light them as they pray, and drink a clear homemade corn
liquor called posh from used Coca-Cola and Pepsi bottles.
</P>
<P>
   It was the drinking that turned many Catholics into
Evangelicals. Agustin Hernandez Santis, a deacon at the Prince of
Peace Temple, said he lost six sons to illnesses related to
alcoholism. When his last son turned a year old, he said, he
stopped drinking posh and joined the Evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, the pastor, said of the Catholics: ``Even the people who
are happy without drinking begin to drink. There is a lot of
suffering from this. They begin to beat their children and they
begin to beat their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the Chamulan Catholics expelled priests from the
Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas because the
diocese tried to push the Chamulans to stop their drinking and
idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   A priest from the Diocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state
capital, now visits to say Mass and to baptize babies every other
Sunday. But the church is mostly run by leaders, called
``mayordomos,'' who are appointed by the village president.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the mayordomos, Hernandez, the teacher, was assigned
to take care of San Juan Chamula's ``Baby Jesus,'' a plastic doll
that represents the son of God.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, Hernandez led a procession of about 10
deputies and their wives _ some Chamulan Catholics have two wives _
to the front of the church carrying a cup of burning incense. After
they prayed, the procession wound through the streets to
Hernandez's house.
</P>
<P>
   There, Hernandez, wearing a heavy black wool poncho and a crown
woven from dried leaves, sat at the edge of the porch, looking like
a king watching over his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, his deputies opened three wooden trunks containing
dozens of satiny baby gowns and blankets. Carefully, the men ironed
each gown. They were for the Baby Jesus to wear for different
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you need new clothes each time you go to a party,''
Hernandez said, ``so does the Baby Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   After the work was done, the drinking would begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of them will toast,'' Hernandez said, pointing to
several Pepsi bottles filled with posh. ``They will toast to show
respect and as a sign of appreciation for their service to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the drinking was not mandatory, he added. ``He who wants to
drink, drinks. He who does not, does not.''

AFTER 15 YEARS, BOMBING STILL PLAGUES PHILADELPHIA

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gerald Wayne Renfrow thought the nightmare had
hit its climax 15 years ago on a gruesome day when _ he still
barely believes it _ he and his neighbors watched the city police
bomb and burn down his solid working-class neighborhood, killing 11
people in a confrontation that became a firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're bombing us again,'' said Renfrow, more furious
than sad as he girds against the city's latest attempt at what
officials are calling ``closure'' for Osage Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   That is the decision last month to send buy-out condemnation
notices to the owners of 60 replacement houses that the city built
as compensation for the victims of the police blunder in May 1985,
when the city routed the MOVE group of armed radicals who had
turned their house at 6221 Osage Ave. into a fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Hovering in a helicopter with the authority of City Hall, the
police dropped explosives on the MOVE row house, setting a fire
that consumed the block-and-a-half neighborhood in West
Philadelphia. Six adults and five children died inside the MOVE
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a scandalous epilogue to the disaster. The
gleaming brick replacement houses for the 60 innocent homeowners on
Osage Avenue and Pine Street turned out to have been built with
construction flaws by a corrupt developer.
</P>
<P>
   The houses have cost the city a small fortune _ over $570,000
for each row house, including an endless wave of faulty repairs.
Support walls cracked for lack of basic expansion joints. Cheap
plumbing and wiring failed. Roofs leaked.
</P>
<P>
   And now the city has suddenly discovered, after 13 years, that
heating systems present ``imminent danger'' to residents through
leaks of carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   The new administration of Mayor John Street, trying to cut the
city's losses, this month offered Renfrow and his neighbors a
painful ultimatum with a Sept. 6 deadline: Each must either quickly
accept a $150,000 buyout or the house will be condemned at market
value for less than half that amount as the city plans to raze the
neighborhood one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistake had piled upon mistake across the years,'' said the
city controller, Jonathan A. Saidel, who drew the line when he
refused to pay a bill from city housing officials for another $9
million in proposed repairs on top of the $35 million total spent
so far on the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over to the site and couldn't believe what I saw,''
Saidel said of piles of fresh brick and window materials waiting
for what has been a nonstop parade of repair workers. ``I wondered
how city inspectors signed off on this project in the first
place,'' the controller said, echoing the long-running complaint of
the residents.
</P>
<P>
   The initial disaster occurred under Mayor W. Wilson Goode, with
repairs going on through the incumbency of Mayor Edward Rendell.
Street, who took office this year, is accused by residents of
trying to wash his hands of the debacle at the expense of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, our new mayor wants closure,'' said Renfrow, the leader of
the Osage/Pine Community Association, who has been trying to rally
his neighbors. ``He wants a feather in his cap as the man who
finally ended the MOVE saga, because we stand as a reflection of
the city's incompetence. So they want to eliminate us, to decimate
us once more.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfrow spoke on the way downtown to fight the ultimatum with a
civil lawsuit. He and 26 other resisters obtained a temporary
restraining order to back up their demand that the city do what it
promised _ provide proper replacement housing in the same
neighborhood the police devastated. The area has the charm and
sociability that residents say they revere and find irreplaceable,
particularly as they begin looking for comparable value in housing
in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting,'' said Sandra Lee at 6254 Osage, one of those
who watched the police attack. She looks back on the MOVE members
as folly-ridden, but at least worth remembering for their
resistance to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the victims and now they're telling us we got to go,''
she said, angry at what she said were ``scare tactics'' by the
city. ``If the heating was dangerous, how come no one died across
these years?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City officials say that was very likely because the windows were
improperly installed, too, and were so leaky that deadly gases were
able to vent through the cracks. Critics say this is precisely the
``catch-22'' mindset that has guaranteed there can be no
``closure'' over the MOVE episode until the neighborhood is made
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to tear them down and sell the land to a
developer, why not build the houses back up for us the right way?''
asked Ernestine Grice, a widow who has lived on Pine Street for 43
years, except for the 18 months when she awaited reconstruction of
her destroyed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely nothing good has come of this,'' said Kenneth
Trujillo, the city solicitor, who is directing the proposed
settlement. ``It's terrible. As a legal matter this administration
could walk away from it, but as a moral matter we could not.'' He
described the settlement as ``double fair value'' and the only way
to end what evolved into a perpetual burden on taxpayers.
Initially, many of the homeowners accepted the buyout ultimatum.
But Renfrow said that they did so under duress and that the city
had a far greater responsibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who accepted, John DeVere, owns two houses on Pine
Street and he considers the offer a windfall, since the resale
possibilities had been nil for years. ``But I'm an exception to
most of the other people,'' DeVere said, ``old people with bills
and mortgages and nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside 6219 Osage, Lucretia Wilson told of the unbearable years
when MOVE members right next door, protesting the conviction of
nine members for the killing of a police officer, turned their
house into a noisome clan commune crowded with scores of animals
and raucous with amplified lectures through the night. The
helicopter raid came after the police said they had tried to serve
an arrest warrant on a MOVE member and met fierce resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rendered my house uninhabitable,'' Wilson said. ``But I
was happy to come home to the new one,'' she said, describing the
restored block filled with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the city isn't working with us,'' Wilson said. ``They're
giving us ultimatums. This situation is no different from the MOVE
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it is worth, Wilson has the sympathy of one of her
former next-door pests, Ramona Africa, a member of the MOVE group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in that house when they bombed it and I'm the only adult
survivor, and the only one who went to prison,'' said Africa, who
served seven years for rioting. ``What we can see is the city
created a bad situation for itself that day. Bombing babies was
wrong, and when the foundation is wrong nothing good can from it.''

POOREST SCHOOLS SHORT ON TEACHERS AND COMPUTERS, SAYS U.S. REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost half the money from federal education programs is going
to the poorest schools in the country, but those schools continue
to be short on qualified teachers and technological resources,
including computers with Internet access, says a new report from
the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released on Friday, examined six federal programs,
including the Title I program that allocates $8 billion each year
to try to help disadvantaged children get access to teachers and
computers. The report was based on data from the 1997-1998 school
year collected in 720 schools in 180 districts.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when federal education programs are being
hotly debated in Congress and in the presidential campaign. Dick
Cheney, the Republican candidate for vice president, said in July
that ``there ought to be accountability'' with Title I money, which
comes from a three-decade-old program. Earlier this year, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, while campaigning for the
Democratic nomination for president, said he would double the
government's Title I allocations if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that although secondary schools had a third of
the country's more impoverished students, only 15 percent of Title
I money went to those schools. Secondary schools were less likely
to receive Title I funds, and they received smaller amounts than
elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the report's more disturbing findings showed that
teachers' aides rather than qualified teachers were teaching many
students in Title I schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paraprofessionals were used in many Title I schools for
teaching and helping to teach students, although their educational
backgrounds did not qualify many of them for such
responsibilities,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Although almost all of the teachers' aides in Title I schools
had a high school diploma or an equivalent degree, only 19 percent
had a bachelor's degree, the report said. That figure dropped to 10
percent in the schools with the highest poverty rates.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the instructional workers supported by Title I money
were teachers' aides. But 41 percent of these aides said that they
spent at least half of their time teaching students on their own,
without a teacher present.
</P>
<P>
   The report confirmed the existence of a growing digital divide
in the country's classrooms, which keeps students from low-income
families from having more access to computers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While federal money paid for almost a quarter of the computers
that schools received in the 1997-1998 school year, ``high-poverty
schools had less access to technology than low-poverty schools in
terms of the quantity, quality and connectivity of computers,'' the
report said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even after using federal funds, the poorest schools had only one
computer for every 17 students, while more affluent schools had one
for every 12 students, the report said. And those computers in the
poorer schools were less likely to be ``advanced multimedia''
computers or ones able to connect to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that only 8 percent of secondary
schoolteachers and 38 percent of elementary schoolteachers said
their students used computers daily. Most teachers said their
lessons ``never'' or ``hardly ever'' required students to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many principals and instructors said that teachers were
responsible for the lack of use of current technology. ``A major
barrier to the effective use of technology,'' the report said,
``was insufficient teacher understanding of ways to integrate
technology into the curriculum.''

   TRAFICANT-RENO _ Ohio Congressman James Traficant has long used
his mouth as a weapon of destruction, but rarely has his vitriol
been this personal. On a Fox News national news program Wednesday
Traficant levied a variety of sordid allegations against Attorney
General Janet Reno _ from mafia-supplied call girls to substance
abuse _ claiming secret affidavits that he refused to release.
Reno, in an unusually strong reaction, said people in public office
have to endure all sorts of nasty comments, but these are some of
the most nasty, unsubstantiated comments she has ever heard.
Traficant himself has said he is about to be indicted on federal
charges, raising questions about the real reason for his public

   GRAPES _ BOONVILLE, N.C. _ In the four decades he's grown
tobacco, Frank Hopson never worried about the rising and setting of
the sun. ``Tobacco's a weed,'' and will grow just about anywhere,
he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco. (Burritt, Atlanta

this is the straw that's broken Joe Camel's back. Will they turn to

its builder, a new celebrity among Russian faith-healers and

The murder of two young American women tourists in March captured

the election took place in China is a sign to some - especially
those at the Carter Center, who are working with China on
standardizing village elections _ that this communist country is on
a slow but steady course towards democracy. To others, village
elections are but a cynical gambit by the central leadership to
maintain control over the massive rural

be owned by employees, there was no indication the participants had
any idea they had just set in motion a series of events that would
culminate 16 years later in a punishing U.S. Tax Court ruling that
found UPS had committed a ``sham transaction.'' As a result, the
company may now be forced to pay the IRS one of the largest bills
in tax history - up to $2.3 billion in back taxes, interest and
penalties. UPS has appealed the ruling and the 11th Circuit
considers it next month. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   PHONES _ ATLANTA _ Local telephone service, the rather boring
plain jane element in communications compared to go-go cell phones
and red-hot long distance services, has suddenly become a new
battleground. Many players are emerging to take on BellSouth, none
more eager than the cable giant, MediaOne, backed by its tentative
parent, AT&AMP;T. Yes, AT&AMP;T, old Ma Bell who used to be everybody's
phone company. The move by the cable company into phones, oddly
enough, is being helped along by BellSouth, mostly in obedience to
federal legislation. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    The Ballpark, hot dogs and Dick Cheney
 &HT;    Why did Bush pick Cheney? Same reason it's called The Ballpark
 &HT;    By GARY BORDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE BALLPARK IN ARLINGTON _ This is the house that George W.
Bush helped build. Politics aside, it's such an improvement over
its ugly predecessor as to not be in the same ballpark, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the team, the lowly Texas Rangers, aren't having the
same success as their erstwhile owner. If the Rangers were a
political candidate, they would be the Lamar Alexander of the
American League, finishing behind ``other'' in most political
polls.
</P>
<P>
   To take the political analogy further than it should ride, the
Rangers seem to have never shaken the ghost of their previous
incarnation as the Washington Senators, a team that by the time it
moved to Texas even gave politics a bad name with their ineptness.
While there have been a few semi-successful years _ they made the
playoffs last year and lost in three straight to the Angels _ the
Rangers are a ``wait 'til next year'' kind of team in a town and
state that expects winners, year in and out. The Cowboys, Stars,
Rockets and Spurs all have had championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the Rangers have a long way to go to match the
futility of my beloved Boston Red Sox, who have every chance of
completing a century without having won a World Series. There's
just 18 more years to go before it's been 100 years since Babe Ruth
pitched the Red Sox to a World Series win, and I've seen nothing to
indicate the losing streak is about to end anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   About the only excitement the Red Sox are providing is Pedro
Martinez who even injured is the best pitcher in baseball. Then
there's Nomar Garciaparra's torrid year at the plate; he's flirting
with .400. Last time a batter topped .400 it was a fellow Red Sox,
Ted Williams in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Rangers, their pitching is dreadful, future
Hall-of-Famer Pudge Rodriguez is out for the year, and the only
reason to head to The Ballpark is that it's a fine venue to watch a
ballgame, even in the dog days of August. At least as long as it's
a night game.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were surprised that W. picked someone as nondescript
as Dick Cheney as his vice-presidential candidate should remember
that, after all, he was one of the partners who picked ``The
Ballpark'' as the name of the Rangers' new stadium. It's a name
that's bland, safe and conservative, like Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, a friend and I made a trip to spring
training in Florida, where we took in games at the Red Sox and
Rangers training sites. Maybe 50 feet away from where we sat,
George W. sat behind the dugout, eating peanuts and occasionally
signing autographs. A man could have made a lot of money at the
time taking bets that this affable man would soon serve as governor
of Texas and then become the GOP nominee for president and, at
least right now, the odds-on favorite to become the next occupant
of the Oval Office. I should have swallowed my pride and asked for
his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Back to The Ballpark. Sure it's got a theme-park look, a faked
old-timeyness that reminds one of those high-dollar subdivisions
where houses look like ersatz Victorian homes ensconced on streets
with names spelled in old English _ Surrey Corner and such. But
there's real grass and few dreadful seats. And there's shade from
the Texas sun, great hot dogs and in the seventh inning, a
impossibly cute little girl sang ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' in
a voice clear as a Central Texas river.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers lost, 4-3 to the White Sox, who are riding high in
the AL Central, another minor miracle in August. It's not a
terribly exciting game, but it's relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention the hot dog? Grilled onions, mustard, jalapenos
and pickle relish, washed down with a ballpark beer. It was just
lovely. My friends and I gossiped, told bad jokes and draped our
legs over the seat backs in front of us, since there were plenty of
vacant seats. It was a fine night.
</P>
<P>
   My politics and W.'s don't often mesh, but a man who loves
baseball has at least a few redeeming qualities. Can you imagine Al
Gore kicked back watching a game, munching on peanuts? Only if
there was a TV camera close by attempting to prove he's just a
regular guy like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I hear Ralph Nader loves baseball, too. I figure he's
a Cubs fan.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Food and politics do mix
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I never thought I'd have to go to Philadelphia
to learn about Mexican food. But that's what happened.
</P>
<P>
   In between covering the GOP National Convention and dodging
protesters, I ended up at a wonderful place called Tequila's in the
downtown area, chatting with the owner, David Suro, 38, on what
makes good Mexican food.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, Suro's restaurant makes really good Mexican food _
not to be confused with Tex-Mex.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 3,000 years of difference,'' said Suro, who grew up in
Guadalajara. ``Mexican food dates back all those centuries and
represents an evolution and blend of cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tex-Mex is basically one, very small segment of the real
Mexican food. But it is food not known in Mexico and is really a
distortion of what Mexican food is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Suro, who settled here after marrying a Philadelphia woman, was
``probably the only Mexican downtown'' when he opened his
restaurant in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a lot of people working in restaurants. Still, the
professional Mexican community is not as large as in other
cities.''
</P>
<P>
   What there is you'll find well represented at Tequila's, a
gathering spot for writers, poets, artists and academics.
</P>
<P>
   It's a ``Bohemian group,'' said Suro, who includes himself in
that category, ``very interesting people who are trying to fix the
problems of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the attraction of Tequila's may be that it
lives up to its name, offering some 150 varieties of the fiery
Mexican liquor. Prices range from $10 for a bottle of everyday
brands to $300 for premium selections, which are aged in casks the
same as brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there's the food.
</P>
<P>
   Suro describes Tequila's cuisine as a ``complex and rich variety
of dishes'' with excellent meat and seafood among more than 50 menu
choices.
</P>
<P>
   As for a speciality of the house, Suro will tell you that ``it's
difficult to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But the one he considers ``most important to our cuisine'' is
the mole poblano sauce, which contains 35 ingredients and is made
from scratch at Tequila's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very challenging to reach the optimum in flavor and to
blend all those ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are the politics at Tequila's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have good friends who are on the right and good friends who
are on the left,'' said Suro, who is a citizen of Mexico with
permanent residency in the U.S. ``We try to get both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way the conversation has balance. Otherwise, we
would be very boring. It's a good blend.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether George W. Bush or Al Gore would make the best president
from the standpoint of relations with Mexico, Suro wouldn't offer
an opinion _ other than to say, ``It is difficult to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He did allow this much:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush speaks good Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was quick to add, ``Al Gore tried. He did not do well,
but I have to say, at least he tried.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't take that as a political prediction. You shouldn't
either.

 &HT;    The saga of a journal and one man's undoing
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My God, what are in those notes?
</P>
<P>
   If George Washington were running for president today, his
political consultants would worry whether Thomas Jefferson's
tediously detailed note-taking would hurt his chances of becoming
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Pity Bob Graham. For more than 20 years, he has written down
every excruciating detail of his life. What time he wakes up. How
much he weighs (``The scale at our Miami Lakes home is the the
best. The one here is off by 3 pounds. The one in the Senate gym is
pretty accurate.'')
</P>
<P>
   What he eats for breakfast, lunch, dinner. If you shake his
hand, your name is in his notebook. He writes even between holes of
golf.
</P>
<P>
   He now has more than 2,500 notebooks stored away. You know the
kind. The little brightly colored spiraled ones that you buy at
Eckerd's and slip in a shirt pocket. Graham buys them in colors _
red, yellow, blue, green. The colors represent summer, fall,
winter, spring. In each notebook, he has blank pages separating
sections and a system for dates that he cheerfully explains in
great detail while standing outside the Senate Hart Office
Building. Trust me, you don't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   He loves talking about his notebooks, and Floridians love his
notebooks. His obsessive record-keeping is a quirky, endearing
trait that also is a tool for helping him keep track of things that
he wants done.
</P>
<P>
   But it was this Jeffersonian penchant for writing down every
minuscule detail that scared Vice President Al Gore's political
consultants. Even the national press wondered aloud if Graham was a
tad too weird.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent ``Meet the Press,'' host Tim Russert asked four
NBC reporters about Gore's list of potential running mates. When it
came to Graham, one reporter worried about Graham's notebooks. They
all nodded knowingly and quickly dismissed Graham's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Graham's word was his own pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a reflection of how frightened we've become of
the written word,'' says University of Florida political scientist
Richard Scher. ``If Thomas Jefferson or James Madison, who both
kept extensive journals, were alive today, they probably couldn't
get on a national ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age where private writings often have been used against
people, ``we've become a shred-the-document society.''
</P>
<P>
   Scher thinks that is a shame. ``If James Madison had not kept
extensive journals, there is a lot we would not know about our
Constitutional Convention,'' he says. ``Someday, Graham's
collection of notebooks is going to be a very valuable resource for
historians.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was on vacation in Wyoming when he got the call from Gore
about his decision to pick Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   It's surely in the notebook.

 &HT;    After the storm, community determination restored Camilla
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, the system does work for disaster victims.
And when it does, it's usually because of the hard work of
goodhearted people.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Valentine's Day in South Georgia began with a
tornado that killed 18 people and destroyed more than 300 homes.
The heaviest concentration of damage was around the McNair Road
area of Camilla.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a modest neighborhood of homes and trailers was
wind-churned into something resembling a small landfill site.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, all the debris is gone. Most of the homes have been
rebuilt or replaced. A few people have even started setting out new
shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   The returning neighbors often help each other with the emotional
part of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Williams, who lost his home to the storm, said the
neighbors gather in small groups, often when one sees another
outside. The storm still dominates their talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tornado did a lot of damage here, but it didn't take away
our hearts,'' Williams said. Most of the framing is finished on
Williams' new house. It will be nicer than his old place, and it
will have a safe room in it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the family next door, where a woman was killed, has moved
away. ``Some of my neighbors, I'll probably never see again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood as a whole, however, is well on its way back.
``We lost a lot of material things, but we've still got our
families. This has pulled us together as a family, as a
neighborhood. We're hangin' in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlyne Jackson said she's anxious to see the work done on a
new home. She's living still in a government trailer on her lot on
McNair Road, while she awaits final approval of a construction
loan. For some of the people who owned homes, the process has been
more complicated than for people who rented, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, moving was never an option, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own this land,'' she said. ``There wasn't nowhere else I
wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The tornado deposited L.C. Gaines and his 90-year-old father on
the ground outside their mobile home, but neither they nor any of
their relatives who live nearby were seriously injured. Now, Gaines
and his father have a new prefabricated home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The programs worked real good,'' Gaines said. ``We had a lot
of help.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a major understatement.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the storm cleared, battalions of volunteers moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Davis, a consulting engineer for both the city of Camilla
and Mitchell County, was drafted to coordinate the volunteer
efforts. The response from area residents and from total strangers
from around the state was ``utterly amazing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the first weekdays after the storm, there were approximately
400 volunteers per day on the scene. And on the first Saturday,
there were 2,000. For the next few weeks, the volunteer forces
stayed at about half those levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the work of debris removal, volunteers helped with
things the disaster victims were emotionally ill-equipped to handle
at the time, like filling out forms for emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinstates your faith in humanity,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the recovery picked up recently, with a
housebuilding ``blitz'' for tornado victims in Camilla. City
Manager Michael Scott said a new subdivision quickly sprung up,
when the city put in utilities and Habitat For Humanity crews
started building 10 new homes at once.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said it's the communitywide determination to put Camilla
back together that has made the recovery successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when these things happen, it's so overwhelming
that some people just throw up their hands and abandon the place,''
Scott said. ``But here, the mindset from the beginning has been,
`Get in, get it cleaned up, put it behind us.' ''

 &HT;    Climbing Fourteeners clarifies mind, spirit
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know don't have to say a thing. They know, and that's
enough. But occasionally somebody asks, or the meter hits full and
the feelings from on top have nowhere to go but out.
</P>
<P>
   So they touch their fingertips together to form a peak and
whisper, ``Fourteener,'' a mantra of endless meaning and
possibility. They spread their arms wide like Moses entering the
promised land: the very center of heaven and earth, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They point to their eyes and ears, talking in terms of the
senses _ air so pure, sky so blue, peaks upon peaks upon peaks to
the edge of forever, a view through the heart and into infinity.
</P>
<P>
   Then they laugh and say they climb pretty much for the hell of
it.
</P>
<P>
   And that's about all the explanation there is.
</P>
<P>
   There are 54 14,000-foot peaks in Colorado. People climb up them
for whatever reason and come back down, and they know _ the
planning and preparation, leaving before dawn when the day is
velvety cold, the climbing and climbing, quads burning and lungs
begging for reprieve, above timberline, 500 yards to go, loose rock
and scary parts, ice and wind, and then ... and then, the summit.
Top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   One down, 53 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the word compulsion a lot,'' said Lon Carpenter,
membership coordinator for the Colorado Mountain Club Western Slope
Group. ``Most people don't start out to climb all the Fourteeners,
but hiking above treeline, making it to the summit and the view
from up there ...''
</P>
<P>
   He knows. But it's hard to explain. He talks about a passion and
commitment for climbing, bordering on addiction, and a ``because
it's there'' mind set that focuses not so much on the summit as on
the challenge and joy of the climb. And just a plain ol' love
affair with mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really become mentally stronger,'' said Terry Schmalz, who
with her husband, Mark, has climbed all 54 Fourteeners. ``Mentally
and physically stronger. You have to focus, so it removes you from
the stress of your everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schmalzes are two of a growing group of climbers who have
submitted all 54 Fourteeners, most of whom, like Carpenter said,
didn't start climbing with that in mind. They just wanted to climb.
</P>
<P>
   For Carpenter, the compulsion to climb started five years ago as
a mild mid-life crisis. He and a friend both turned 40 around the
same time and decided they wanted to do something big in their
lives. They decided they should climb a mountain. A year later,
early on a summer morning, they began their climb up Mount
Sneffels.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an ideal day. Carpenter's gloves got wet, he didn't
have an ice ax, his rain gear wasn't heavy-duty enough, he had no
extra socks. He and his friend got back down safely, fortunately, a
lot smarter and, in Carpenter's case, hooked. Now he has less than
a dozen Fourteeners to summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first thing I've had a passion about in my life,''
he said. ``It's given me a respect for people who have a passion
for the things they do in life. Since I started climbing, this is
the most alive I've felt. I can't tell you what I did last week,
but I can tell you what happened every five minutes of a climb.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes something like this: You stand at the trailhead early in
the morning, the sky inky blue and, even in summer, your breath
making puffy clouds. Get your pack situated, your boots tied just
right, everything ready and adjusted, and start walking. At first
you're in high forest, pine and aspen standing like sentries in the
deep morning shadows along the trail, which is spongy with dead
needles and damp earth. The air is so crisp it snaps, so clean you
reach out to grab a handful.
</P>
<P>
   The sky goes from purple to fuchsia to pink to gold as the sun
wakes up. You climb up and up, over rocks, winding around
switchbacks, past streams guarded by wildflowers, gulping water and
air as you stop for rest. Mountain birds warble and a rustling off
in the trees might be any number of animals. A layer comes off as
you warm up. And you keep going up. Plants are getting shorter and
sparser, your legs are feeling warm, you're breathing faster and
you move a little slower so you don't get light-headed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon there are no plants, just a moonscape of gray rock and
patches of snow. Little fires ignite in different parts of your
body as you see the summit and keep climbing up. It's not as close
as it looks and the air is thin. You consider stopping, possibly
turning around as your legs beg for mercy and your lungs threaten
revolt. But you're so close. So you go, and then you're at the top,
a narrow ridge from which the wind blows clouds straight into your
hands. You can turn in a small circle to see a world of peaks and
valleys and, in that instant, they're all yours.
</P>
<P>
   And then you come back down.
</P>
<P>
   And then you're most likely hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Moston knows what that's like. In summer 1957 he climbed his
first Fourteener. He was in Ouray at a geology field camp when one
of his professors from the Colorado School of Mines decided to run
a little extra energy out of the students, so he led them up Mount
Sneffels.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Moston was a smoker, he'd never climbed a mountain
and he had no idea what to expect. They didn't have mountains like
that in Pennsylvania, where he's from. So he just put on his
regular shoes and went, with ``no idea what I was getting into,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were on the summit later than they should have been, so a
thunderstorm swooped in and lightning flashed around them as they
headed down. The static electricity stood their hair up straight
and Moston found something he loves. On his days off from working
as an engineer, he climbed. In 1974, he finished the Fourteeners
when he and a friend climbed El Diente, though it never was his
goal to do all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an enjoyment of the outdoors and seeing new
things,'' he said, which he gets to do more often now that, at 67,
he's retired from 33 years as a district engineer for the Colorado
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Most climbers will say that they learn as they go _ what to do,
what not to do, what to bring, how to behave in the mountains. The
Schmalzes, who both are teachers in School District 51 and spend
their summers climbing peaks, took basic mountaineering and first
aid courses through the Colorado Mountain Club to learn technical
skills like using an ice ax and survival skills such as how to
bivouac.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Colorado's Fourteeners have routes that beginning
climbers can hike up, but often more experienced climbers take
challenging routes that require technical skill.
</P>
<P>
   They learn when to turn around if the clouds look threatening,
how to navigate narrow ridges of rock and not plunge to their
deaths, what weight in the backpack is worth taking and what should
be left behind. They develop opinions about what should and
shouldn't be counted as a Fourteener. They talk in code when they
get together, swapping stories about Little Bear and Redcloud,
Gerry Roach's book, crampons, quad clean-outs, ice and a moose.
</P>
<P>
   On their last climb, the Schmalzes saw a moose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You climb for the experience, what you're going to see,'' said
Bill Hamann, who has been climbing since the early '60s and has
done 52 Fourteeners. He said he doesn't care if he gets the other
two because he climbs for the personal challenge and for the joy of
just being out there.
</P>
<P>
   Many climbers, he said, climb for the lists. They want to get
all the Fourteeners, then the top 100 peaks in Colorado, then the
top 200 peaks, then all 637 Thirteeners, or all the peaks in one
range, or all the peaks in a quadrant of the state, or the highest
points in each Colorado county.
</P>
<P>
   Some climbers branch out to the highest point in each state, or
head overseas to mountains in Peru or Mexico or Nepal. Serious
climbers will say it's in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a focus that washes out your everyday anxieties
and concerns,'' said Allen Conrad, 63, who moved to Colorado two
years ago from California, where he did extensive climbing. He's
getting started on the Fourteeners, but just for the fun of it and
not for a list.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as every climber will tell you, obsessions and goals
and passions aside, it should be fun. Which probably is why so many
people are on Colorado's Fourteeners and why those peaks are in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourteeners are being loved to death, the life stomped right
out of them by crowds of adoring climbers. Several weekends ago,
volunteers with the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative counted more
than 640 climbers on Grays and Torreys peaks on one Saturday, said
Jennifer Tucker, education and outreach coordinator for the
Colorado Fourteeners Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The climbing season is short _ about 100 days in summer _ so new
climbers are coming to the mountains in droves, particularly the
mountains with easy-to-navigate trails that don't require technical
climbing skill. The problem is not only extreme use, but ignorance
of mountain etiquette and leave no trace practices, said Loretta
McEllhiney, Colorado Fourteeners coordinator for the U.S. Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot of vegetation loss and a lot of soil
loss,'' she said, citing as an example Capitol Peak, where climbers
have created trails that turned into gullies and rerouted a creek.
``We can't ever put that creek back into its original bed. And the
vegetation loss is serious because we have a lot of sensitive
species, especially in our alpine environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Trails are being trampled through sensitive environments, litter
is being dropped, fire-pits being dug in wrong places, ground water
being polluted, she said. To combat increased degradation of the
Fourteeners, the U.S. Forest Service and the Colorado Fourteeners
Initiative have teamed to study each Fourteener, prioritize the
seriousness of the damage on each one and begin working to remedy
the problems, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   A project oversight team of biologists, geologists, soil
specialists, environmentalists and concerned citizens analyzed
resource damage, available resources, threatened and endangered
species, rate of change and other factors to prioritize each peak.
The peaks with a high priority ranking for preservation are Torreys
and Grays, Quandry, Blanca, Crestone Needle, Pyramid, Pikes Peak
and Mounts Bierstadt, Harvard, Shavano, Democrat, Bross, Sneffels,
Columbia, Yale, Massive and Missouri Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Once the peaks are prioritized, volunteers set to work. They
reconstruct or build sustainable trails from trailhead to summit,
Tucker said, ``so it will be the kind of trail hikers will stay
on.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, trails have been built or restored on Mount Elbert,
Mount Belford, Humboldt Peak, Huron Peak and La Plata Peak, and
restoration projects are in progress on Mount Bierstadt, Mount
Harvard, Grays and Torreys peaks and Missouri Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   McEllhiney said some climbers have criticized the Fourteeners
Initiative and the Forest Service for building trails, making it
easier for more climbers to use the mountains and ruining the
wilderness experience with a trail, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I very much believe that the reason people are there is
not because there's a trail or a lack of trail,'' she said. ``It's
because there's a mountain over 14,000 feet. The Forest Service
didn't build trails to the top of the peaks because they didn't
know people would be interested in doing that. Now we're doing
crisis management.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Fourteeners Initiative also this summer initiated a
peak steward program in the Clear Creek ranger district, in which
volunteers at the trailheads, on the peaks and along the trails
guide climbers and serve as an education resource about wilderness,
leave no trace climbing, wildlife, alpine ecology and climbing
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to protect and preserve the integrity of
Colorado's peaks and the quality of recreational opportunities they
provide,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the crowds on the Fourteeners, many serious climbers
have turned to other, more remote peaks _ the less-often climbed
Thirteeners, peaks in Wyoming's Wind Rivers or Tetons or
California's Sierra Nevadas, peaks that don't have the reputation
of the Fourteeners but are just as challenging and just as
beautiful, Mark Schmalz said.
</P>
<P>
   But they still nibble at the Fourteeners. They can't help it.
There's just something about those mountains _ miracles of plate
tectonics that call your name and offer whatever it is you're
looking for. Plus a million miles of blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to explain.

 &HT;    Fires threaten precious artifacts
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK - Two months before a pair of wildfires
ravaged Mesa Verde National Park, archeologist Linda Towle sat in
the living room of her house in the park packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was packing as I was watching the film from Los Alamos
(N.M.,) and I said, 'That's it,''' recalled Towle, 52, chief of
research and resource management at Mesa Verde. ``I boxed up all of
my photos, slides and family papers and I rented a storage unit in
Cortez.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Towle remembers the day: Thursday, July 20. The time was a
quarter of two. She had just settled down in an administrative
meeting to close out the year-end budget when she heard the news
that she had been dreading all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendant's secretary came in and said, ``Just want
you to know there's a fire. ... It's probably not a big deal,'''
said Towle.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something different about this fire. It was
behaving erratically, burning late into the night instead of
resting. Fire conditions were prime _ dry oak brush, pinon and
juniper trees baked in the scorching afternoon sun _ and the
brilliant blue Colorado sky provided no hint of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Towle heard the fire management officer get on the radio and
call for an evacuation of the park.
</P>
<P>
   She made the mad dash home, grabbed what she could and raced
over to the office to account for her employees, some of whom were
still out in the backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Towle found herself holed up at the Comfort Inn in
Cortez with her cat, Kiva, a stray she befriended eight years ago
after the six-week old kitten had been abandoned inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the Bircher fire, which scorched more
than 23,000 acres inside one of the nation's largest archeological
preserves, Towle found herself in evacuation mode again. This time
a lightning strike on the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation near the
tiny town of Towaoc started another fire. It was making a run for
the opposite side of the park, sweeping up steep rugged canyons
filled with bone dry vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pony fire charred more than 5,200 acres before it was
contained Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews were brought in from as far away as Alaska to battle
the blaze. Aggressive air attacks obliterated the remote terrain
almost daily with water and slurry, a reddish-colored substance
made up of chemicals to douse the fire. On the ground, firefighters
carved out fire lines by hand as archeologists worked ahead of them
scouting out potential sites.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2,000 new archeological sites have been discovered
as a result of the fires, but so far no major sites have been
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   Forican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts are the only records left detailing the history
and habits of the Ancestral Puebloans, a lost civilization that
vanished more than 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the fires, special precautions were taken to protect the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks circled the perimeter of the tin building like wagon
trains from the days of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   The windows and vents were covered with reflective fire
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were instructed to save the building at any cost _
even if that meant using bulldozers to build a fire line, whichver
strikes the same place twice,'' but could it strike three times in
a row?
</P>
<P>
   For now, all Towle can do is wait.

 &HT;    Tobacco farmers turning to grapes
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOONVILLE, N.C. _ In the four decades he's grown tobacco, Frank
Hobson never worried about the rising and setting of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobacco's a weed,'' the Yadkin County farmer always figured,
and it would grow just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as one of a steadily growing number of North Carolina
farmers diversifying into grapes, 57-year-old Hobson has learned to
pay attention to sunshine and other considerations critical to
cultivating sweet, firm grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing, I swear,'' said Hobson, holding the tender
green leaves of a Cabernet Sauvignon grape vine in one of his big
rough hands, and a Salem Light in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, in Dobson, officials at Surry Community College
are giddy over grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with classes Thursday, the college will be the first in
North Carolina to offer a two-year degree in viticulture, the study
of growing and marketing grapes. Over the past year, farmers
swelled the attendance of noncredit classes intended to introduce
grapes as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking for years for something new, knowing that
tobacco was waning,'' said John Collins, 56, the college's vice
president for instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics abound, pointing to supposedly promising crops _
such as kiwi fruit in South Carolina and broccoli in Virginia _
that flopped once planted in Southern soil.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs, chickens, strawberries, soybeans and sweet potatoes are
among the many crops farmers raise, but typically not as profitably
as tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivating grapes also requires a greater initial investment
and different growing techniques than tobacco, a crop farmers are
so accustomed to growing they're reluctant to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't see that many farmers, especially the smaller
ones, going into the grape business,'' said Darrell Crisp,
executive director of the Farm Services Agency in Surry County.
</P>
<P>
   But agricultural experts say grapes represent a potentially
profitable payoff for some of North Carolina's 13,000 tobacco
growers.
</P>
<P>
   With annual sales worth $2.3 million, Tar Heel grapes are a long
way from replacing the state's embattled, $650-million-a-year,
flue-cured tobacco crop. But, officials said, in areas such as
these Blue Ridge foothills, where nights are cool, grapes can be
grown as profitably acre for acre as the golden leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Net profit on an acre of tobacco is about $1,200 in Surry
County, according to Charles Boles, agricultural instructor at the
local community college. The potential profit for grapes is about
$1,300 to $1,500 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, more than 125 farmers are growing some 1,200 tons of
grapes for sale as wine, juice and fresh fruit, according to the
North Carolina Grape Council.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hobson is harvesting 60 acres of tobacco, he and his
wife, Lenna, already have adopted RagApple Lassie as the name of
their fledgling vineyard and the winery they hope to start. They
plan to do it alone, or set up a cooperative winery with other
farmers, and hire a winemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the better,'' Lenna said. ``They are going to feed
off one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Dobson, the largest of North Carolina's 12 wineries,
the $10 million Shelton Vineyards is preparing to harvest its first
crop of grapes and bottle its first wine next summer.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the next few years, Shelton Vineyards intends to
buy grapes from local growers as it expands its own harvest from 60
acres to 250 acres. The anticipated need for workers trained in
grape production prompted the vineyard's owners, millionaire
brothers Ed and Charlie Shelton, to approach Surry Community
College about starting the viticulture curriculum. They've
committed $50,000 to the program over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see more wineries in the area,'' said Ed
Shelton, 59. ``It adds credibility to our opinion that this is a
good area to make wine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious they grow here,'' said Sean McRitchie, 37,
driving slowly past row after row of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and
other varieties, on farmland that once raised cattle and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   He relocated to Dobson from Oregon with his family two years ago
to start the Sheltons' vineyard and winery.
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, Surry Community College hired McRitchie's father,
Bob, also an Oregon winemaker, as its ``resident viticulture
expert'' and viticulture instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Other family members are involved. Sean McRitchie's wife, Patty,
a lawyer, does legal work for the vineyard. Aside from raising
three children, they care for the vineyard's two Labrador
retrievers.
</P>
<P>
   The black one is named Cabernet, the blond one Chardonnay.

 &HT;    Tobacco farmers see future up in smoke
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSET, Ky. _ Wearing a New Holland baseball cap on his head
and despair on his sleeve, farmer Jack DeBord knows money doesn't
grow on trees. It grows on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Raising beef cattle pays some bills in the valleys between
Kentucky's rocky outcrops. But tobacco, DeBord said, ``That's how
we make our living.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations of Southerners, tobacco has been golden. The
shimmer comes from a 67-year-old federal price-support program that
guarantees farmers minimum payments for their tobacco in exchange
for production limits _ the highly revered quota.
</P>
<P>
   Grow a good crop, and you're in the money. It's what DeBord's
father and grandfather did. Tobacco shaped farm culture for decades
in Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and South
Carolina. Nine pounds of every 10 harvested in this country comes
from those states.
</P>
<P>
   But a string of anti-smoking settlements _ including July's $145
billion Florida jury verdict against the nation's largest tobacco
companies _ is forcing farmers to find other ways to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Louisville, cigarette companies, farmers, members of
Congress and scientists will gather for a ``tobacco summit'' to
exchange ideas on how to cushion the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to try everything,'' said DeBord, whose family has
farmed for 100 years. ``It's very somber and distressed.''
</P>
<P>
   With Big Tobacco trying to cover legal bills, cigarettes cost
more. Fewer people are smoking. Imported leaf is rising. As a
result, tobacco quota has fallen faster than a two-legged cow.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida judgment likely faces a lengthy appeal. Still,
farmers wonder whether it's the straw that has broken Joe Camel's
back. So while they're flexing their muscles in the fields, they're
fixing their eyes on the future. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee and Kentucky, freshwater shrimp ponds and catfish
farms are replacing tobacco fields. There also are fresh crops of
blueberries, herbs and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, growers are experimenting with genetically modified
tobacco intended for pharmaceutical products. CropTech, a
Blacksburg company, inserts genes that allow the plants to make the
same kind of proteins produced by the human body.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina and Maryland, grapes are creeping into
prominence. Kentucky now has an active vineyard society.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia and elsewhere, some farmers have clamored for
permission to grow hemp, a marijuana cousin. Hemp, the country's
leading crop in the 1700s, is used to make clothing, rope, paper
and candy, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   When flue-cured auctions opened Aug. 1 in Georgia and Florida,
farmers grumbled about low opening prices. Similar anxiety spread
as the Carolina markets opened last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky and Tennessee, farmers of burley tobacco will
harvest their fields this month and next. Their auctions start the
Monday before Thanksgiving. They expect the same dim prospects as
their flue-cured brethren.
</P>
<P>
   DeBord is looking at a new kind of tobacco. In addition to his
regular burley, which cigarette companies blend with flue-cured
varieties, DeBord is growing an experimental crop.
</P>
<P>
   Star Scientific Inc. of Chester, Va., a tobacco company that's
not part of any settlement, hopes the new curing and harvesting
process will produce fewer cancer-causing chemicals. The aim is a
safer cigarette, one less prone to ignite major lawsuits that have
pushed the industry to the brink.
</P>
<P>
   DeBord is among 100 Kentucky farmers growing the new tobacco.
For their troubles, Star farmers will receive 30 cents extra per
pound come auction time.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean almost $1,800 extra for DeBord's 3 acres of
experimental tobacco. He hasn't given up on traditional tobacco.
But by working with Star, he's preparing just in case the
unthinkable day comes when regular tobacco won't pay the mortgage.
Already, he's raised cash by selling some farm frontage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the four major companies go bankrupt, we're looking at
going out of business,'' said DeBord, who won't push his 2
1/2-year-old son, Zachary, into farming. If Big Tobacco succumbs,
Star ``might be the only purchaser we have.''
</P>
<P>
   On a hot afternoon this month, fellow growers came to DeBord's
farm off a skinny asphalt road. They gathered around a concrete
pad, where a narrow barn made of gleaming silver metal recently had
been built.
</P>
<P>
   Valves, motors, pipes and propane tanks churned in the back of
the high-tech barn, which heats bales of tobacco to 250 degrees.
The curing process is designed to quickly eliminate the moisture
scientists think helps spread cancerous toxins through the burley
leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the future,'' said 68-year-old tobacco farmer
Wendell Massengale, one of the 40 or so growers who came to tour
DeBord's experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Southern farmers got hooked on the federal tobacco program in
1933 as the Great Depression triggered farm collapses throughout
the country. Every three years, farmers vote whether to continue
the program. If they accept, production limits are set.
</P>
<P>
   Quotas cause prices to rise artificially at auction houses,
where cigarette companies bid on batches of tobacco leaf. In good
years, bid prices rise far above federal supports.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, bids have hovered near the support level.
</P>
<P>
   The bids _ and the price support _ have kept 50-year-old Roger
Quarles growing tobacco most of his life. The rich soil of
Kentucky's hilly terrain is perfect for tobacco _ but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Quarles lives in Scott County north of Lexington. He has spent
the past couple of years buying up quota from other farmers and
sharecroppers.
</P>
<P>
   But increasing tobacco imports, more lawsuits and decreasing
cigarette consumption have forced quota cuts. Since 1997, quota has
dropped 65 percent. Imagine, Quarles says, being told today your
wages would drop in half, now live with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our best-laid plans have been torn to pieces,'' Quarles
said. He figures he'll spend more time on his farm services
business that provides assistance to neighbor growers.
</P>
<P>
   Some tobacco companies are trying direct contracts with farmers,
a move some growers say signals the demise of price supports. If
the federal program ends, thousands will be flushed from tobacco
farming.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so easy for tobacco farmers, who average 58 years
of age in Kentucky, to change careers overnight. New niche markets
are competitive, almost cutthroat. As one agricultural expert said,
it's not like a 58-year-old is going to be a farmer one day and a
water-ski instructor the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to farm in central Kentucky and farm in an
economical way and provide for your family, you grow tobacco,''
Quarles said. ``That's what you do. It's all I've ever known.''

 &HT;    Year-old Mall of Georgia changes area economic climate
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross and Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fletcher hangs out at the Mall of Georgia but doesn't
spend a dime.
</P>
<P>
   He is a long-haired cat with a shiny black coat who lives at
Hollister &AMP; Co., an apparel store at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Fletcher sleeps on a stack of jeans, or purrs to adoring
customers. If he tries to leave the store, his magnetic-sensor
collar sends a beeping signal to employees to fetch him. By night,
Fletcher sleeps in a cage in the stockroom, safely away from the
parrot out by the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is a living prop at one of the newest retailers at Mall
of Georgia. The gigantic Buford mall is among the first in the
country to land Hollister &AMP; Co., a new concept by Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch that caters to teens.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since opening, Mall of Georgia has landed dozens of
cutting-edge retailing concepts, including new prototype stores for
toy seller FAO Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   The mall, about 35 minutes north of downtown Atlanta, debuted
one year ago today with 100 specialty tenants and three anchor
department stores. Now it has close to 200. In November, Rich's is
set to open a department store between Dillard's and J.C. Penney.
The mall has also spawned surrounding retail development.
</P>
<P>
   Shopper traffic is brisk on weekends, but during the week it's
hit or miss, retailers say. There's no office development base
close to the mall _ at least not yet _ to attract workers during
weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Mall officials say shopper visits are rising and total 11
million since opening, excluding the outdoor ``village'' area. They
have also said sales are only slightly more than the national mall
average of $323 per square foot. Vacancies remain, with the mall
about 85 percent leased. The industry average for malls open a year
or more is about 90 percent, according to the International Council
of Shopping Centers, an industry group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The established Gwinnett Place mall 12 miles south on I-85 draws
an estimated 17 million visitors annually and is 96 percent leased,
according to marketing brochures. Both malls are operated by Simon
Property Group, an Indianapolis-based mall company.
</P>
<P>
   New competition for both will come from Discover Mills, a new
off-price mall being built off I-85 between Mall of Georgia and
Gwinnett Place. It's slated for a 2001 opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discover Mills will have an impact,'' said Dave Fick, managing
director of Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ``But long term,
Mall of Georgia is a fine asset.''
</P>
<P>
   When developers Ben Carter and Scott Hudgens envisioned the Mall
of Georgia, it was to be the ``mall of the future,'' with a design
like no other in metro Atlanta and few places nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor village consists of cafes and shops encircling a
concert pavilion. A dancing fountain draws kids.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Piassick, California Cafe's sous chef, said teens and
families hang out at the mall because there is ``not much to do''
in Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a destination,'' Piassick said. ``There's a lot of
foot traffic, but I'm not sure how many are bringing out shopping
bags.''
</P>
<P>
   The acreage where the mall is today was once considered rural
Gwinnett County. Three years ago the mall began to take shape,
replacing the forrested landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the center rise from a hole in the ground,'' said
Scott Higley, mall marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Most any consumable item can now be found within a half-mile of
the shopping compound.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Sprint PCS, Hi-Fi Buys, CD Warehouse, Mattress Firm
and Ulta, a cosmetics discounter, have set up shop within a stone's
throw of the complex. Nearly every nook and cranny of square
footage along the Buford Drive gateway is either hosting a convoy
of bulldozers or boasting a placard announcing imminent
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work here, and we're surprised by things cropping up,''
Higley said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mall's location and the tight labor market make
recruiting efforts a challenge for the proliferating restaurants
and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dudley, general manager of California Cafe, said he's had
trouble finding staffers for his restaurant in the mall village.
He's currently seeking a head chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people that came here, came out to live,'' Dudley said,
referring to the pricey subdivisions that surround the area. ``I've
got great service staff but not enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hoped that a fledgling plan to create bus service in
Gwinnett will ease the shortage of service workers.
</P>
<P>
   While the success of that project remains to be seen, the Mall
of Georgia already draws buses filled with tourist shoppers from
outside the area.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett officials believe that has contributed to a rise in
tourism spending in the county from $1.2 billion in 1998 to $1.6
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The main parcel of mall property will be charged $1.7 million in
property taxes this year, according to Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   The mall also contributed to a rise in sales tax revenue
returned to Gwinnett County by the state, from $51.2 million from
November 1998 through April 1999 to $59.2 million for the same
period ending this past April. Malls track sales annually, but the
figures do not include anchor stores because their sales are not
reported individually.
</P>
<P>
   Mall of Georgia's sales figures also don't reflect the impact of
new stores, such as the FAO Schwarz that opened in June. More are
coming, including Rich's and specialty retailers Petite
Sophisticate and August Max.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he's negotiating with several others, including Gap
Body and Sketchers, and two restaurants. There's room for a sixth
anchor, but that's still five to seven years out, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By year-end, the mall will be over 90 percent leased,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-mile corridor between Gwinnett Place mall and Mall of
Georgia also is filling up.
</P>
<P>
   Several developers have proposed commercial and mixed-use
projects between Gwinnett Place and the Mall of Georgia, including
2 million square feet of office space being developed by Taylor &AMP;
Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Those developments could spur more shopping at Mall of Georgia.
But the Discover Mills project down the interstate will also bring
new competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mills Corp., of Arlington, Va., has already broken ground on the
1.3 million-square-foot outlet and entertainment center, just off
I-85 at Sugarloaf Parkway. Known tenants include Off 5th/Saks Fifth
Avenue; Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World; F.Y.E. For Your
Entertainment, a media superstore and arcade; and Jillian's
Billiard Cafe, a dining megaplex. Discover Mills plans to have
about 200 tenants when it opens in fall 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon is scared of Discover Mills,'' analyst Fick said.
``They're about to get cut off at the pass. Discover Mills has
better visibility and physical location.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carter maintained the Mills project will simply draw more
shopper traffic to the county, and that's ``positive'' for Mall of
Georgia.

 &HT;    Some 90 companies are chasing BellSouth in Georgia, seeking
residential and business customers
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTAm _ Local telephone service is the rather boring Plain
Jane of communications when compared to tiny cell phones, fancy
pagers and red hot long-distance. But it has suddenly become a new
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting atop the local phone service is BellSouth, with some 5
million customers in Georgia alone. The real battling is between
the competitors that are trying to take business from the familiar
Bell company.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, according to BellSouth, some 90 companies of
various kinds are in the chase to sign up residences as well as
businesses all over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Major players going up against BellSouth include WorldCom,
Teleport and Intermedia in the bid for commercial service. And in
the residential market, the insurgents include Georgia CommSouth,
Mpower and Knology.
</P>
<P>
   Some newcomers to the local phone service are offering their own
service. Others are ``resellers,'' companies that simply buy
BellSouth service wholesale and sell more cheaply than BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia CommSouth, a reseller, has carved out a special market
aiming at customers with poor credit or who otherwise fail to
qualify for regular phone service. It offers such customers phone
service on a prepaid basis for $29 in advance and $49 per month for
one line.
</P>
<P>
   Among these newcomers stalking residential customers, none is
more eager, ambitious or better financed than MediaOne, the metro
Atlanta cable provider that has merged with AT&AMP;T. In the last
several years MediaOne has embarked on switching its service to
interactive digital offerings, including telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   That switchover is nearly complete, and MediaOne is turning to
the job of capitalizing on its investment by offering customers a
smorgasbord that includes 200 channels of digital television, a
high-speed connection for computers and, now, telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, MediaOne is offering a package of services,
including phone service. The company expects to offer a
one-price-for-all package across the region, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's main selling point for local phone service, a real
grabber, is that it costs 35 percent to 50 percent as much as
BellSouth, depending on phone requirements. Put another way,
MediaOne customers could have two phone lines, including one with
the fancy features, for the price of one full-featured line by
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why BellSouth would tolerate this kind of rate difference,
a MediaOne executive put it succinctly:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so small at this point, we haven't even hit their radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually BellSouth is active on many fronts, including extension
of high-speed data capability and other growth areas. Moreover,
BellSouth has incentive to help the local challengers at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   Both the carrot and stick have been brought to bear on
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Federal legislation passed in 1996 to spur competition requires
local phone giants like BellSouth to make it easy and convenient
for local competitors to enter the area, and that's the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, and more powerfully, there is the carrot: the hope and
expectation that a showing of local competition will help convince
federal regulators to look more favorably on BellSouth's bid for
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   While BellSouth may seem almost indifferent toward the flurry of
activity in offering local service, it is deadly serious about
getting a chance to offer long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   And why would BellSouth have such high hopes for a field as
furiously competitive as long-distance?
</P>
<P>
   ed to be self-healing in many accidents or storm damage, much
like traditional phone lines that can bypass certain breaks in the
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of the cable phone service, with a year or two of
experience, report that the reliability is good.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the service started, however, can be a chore.
</P>
<P>
   This writer switched to MediaOne recently, but got stood up at
the agreed-on installation time. MediaOne explained later that the
handoff from BellSouth incurred problems, when there was some
difficulty confirming the existence of my two phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And that, in fact, is a most common complaint from those trying
to compete _ that BellSouth doesn't smoothly handle the transition.
BellSouth says it has been addressing those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Others report a need for repeated visits to get the service
started, but generally when the connection has been made
satisfactorily, the service is what you expect from traditional
phone service.
</P>
<P>
   To allay fears, MediaOne is offering a free initial month of
service and a promise to switch you back to the original phone
company if you are not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The extra good news is that you keep your phone number, so
people who call you have no reason to notice the change. Also,
under contract with BellSouth, the familiar directory assistance
(411) continues, as well as 911.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BellSouth bolsters its case for getting into
long-distance by reporting that it has ``lost'' 10 percent of the
4.3 million lines in Georgia to various competitors. A majority of
the loss has probably taken place in metro Atlanta, where about 3
million of those lines are located.

 &HT;    CD video recorder is latest in digital switch
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The trend of going from analog recording _ tape,
vinyl records, etc. _ to digital _ optical discs, computer chips,
etc. _ continues with the introduction of the Tera Optix CD Video
Recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The unit looks and works like a conventional video recorder, but
instead of recording on tape the TeraOptix machine records on CD-R
or CD-RW blank discs. The recordings are digital and can be played
on compatible DVD players, CD players and computers.
</P>
<P>
   TeraOptix is based in Singapore and their line of digital
products, including the CD Video Recorder, is only available in a
few retail outlets in the United States but can be ordered from the
company's GoTerapin.com online store.
</P>
<P>
   The TeraOptix CD Video Recorder is about the size of a VHS video
recorder. With a distinctive colored cowl and silver accents, its
retro science fiction look seems to have been plucked from an Ultra
Man soundstage.
</P>
<P>
   The TeraOptix CD Video Recorder accepts inputs from broadcast,
cable or satellite television signals, camcorders, VHS recorders,
DVDs and other audiovisual sources. It also records sound from CDs,
radios, records and other audio sources.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are recorded on 74-minute CD-R or CD-RW blank
optical discs that look like ordinary CDs. CD-R discs can be
recorded only once, but CD-RW discs are ``rewritable'' and can be
erased and rerecorded many times.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R and CD-RW discs can be purchased fairly inexpensively
wherever computer and advanced audio products or sold. TeraOptix
sells boxes of 25 CD-R discs for $29.99 or 10 CD-RW discs for the
same price.
</P>
<P>
   Once recorded, the discs can be replayed on the CD Video
Recorder or on DVD players and multimedia computers set up to play
CD-R and CD-RW discs. Audio recordings can be played on CD players.
</P>
<P>
   TeraOptix currently offers its CD Video Recorder online for
$599. To order or to get more information, log on to
www.goterapin.com, the company's online store.

 &HT;    UPS set to appeal $1.8 billion Tax Court judgment
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year after United Parcel Service Corp. set aside
$1.8 billion in one of the biggest U.S. Tax Court judgments in
history, the world's largest transportation company is preparing to
take the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   UPS lawyers are scheduled to submit written arguments Monday in
Atlanta's 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals spelling out their
reasons the 1999 ruling against them should be reversed and the
massive judgment overturned. The case is likely to take many
months, possibly years, to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts say UPS has compelling historical as well
as financial reasons to fight to the end. Throughout its 97-year
history, the company has sought to be known as a place where
managers make moral decisions _ not just legal ones. U.S. Tax Court
Judge Robert Ruwe's stinging judgment last year assails that
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at UPS feel that they've been acting ethically and
responsibly all along,'' said Rashad Bajarkly, transportation
analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York. ``They've already
had to endure the financial pain of putting the money aside. Now
they feel like they're obligated to fight to protect their good
name.''
</P>
<P>
   INSURANCE ARM OFFSHORE
</P>
<P>
   The collision between UPS and the Internal Revenue Service was
set in motion Feb. 24, 1983, when UPS Chief Financial Officer
Walter Danielewski met in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., with insurance
executives from UPS and Frank B. Hall Insurance Brokers Inc., one
of the largest insurance firms in the world. The discussion topic
was ``excess value charges,'' or the fees UPS collected from
shippers buying additional insurance on the packages they sent.
</P>
<P>
   EVCs in increments as small as 25 cents were projected to bring
UPS revenue of $69.9 million that year. The company expected to pay
$21.4 million in claims. After taxes, UPS stood to clear $26.1
million in EVC profits, although Hall experts believed UPS could
raise its margins far higher.
</P>
<P>
   If UPS created its own offshore insurance subsidiary, Hall
officials proposed, UPS would not have to pay federal income taxes
on EVC income and annual profits would surge to $42.2 million _ a
jump of $16 million, or 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judge's 114-page ruling, UPS executive Allen
Dougherty, in attendance at the meeting, ``suggested an alternative
whereby (UPS) would form an insurance company in Bermuda to be
owned by employees. Mr. Dougherty believed the Bermuda insurance
company ... (would) not have U.S. tax obligations on profits.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next five months, conservative and tax-savvy UPS
managers endorsed a plan to create an offshore insurance
subsidiary. On July 14, 1983, the principals at the New York
meeting reconvened in Bermuda to found UPSINSCO Ltd. (later renamed
Overseas Partners Limited) to handle revenue from EVC sales. Three
of the fledgling company's five directors elected that day,
Danielewski, Kenneth L. Johnson and Jerome D. Stein, were UPS
managers.
</P>
<P>
   OPL performed much as its founders had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, the IRS challenged the arrangement, and
Ruwe sided with the agency. He issued a judgment against UPS
including back taxes, penalties and interest that could reach $2.4
billion. The company put $1.8 billion in an IRS escrow account to
avoid future penalties and interest. UPS denied wrongdoing and
quickly filed an appeal in Atlanta. Company officials declined to
be interviewed for this story, however, saying they would make
their case in court.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT WORKED
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, UPS package insurance worked like this: UPS
self-insured each shipment for a maximum value of $100. If
customers wanted more coverage, they paid 25 cents for each
additional $100 in declared value. UPS recorded the extra charges
on its regular pickup bills, collected the funds and deposited them
into its bank accounts. The company reported EVC revenue to U.S.
regulatory agencies and paid income tax on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 1984, however, that system changed.
</P>
<P>
   UPS still marketed and collected EVCs. But instead of depositing
the money in UPS bank accounts and reporting it as income, the
company directed EVC revenue to an insurance subsidiary of American
International Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That company transferred the money by wire to OPL, the Bermuda
firm that UPS managers founded and controlled. OPL reinsured UPS
shipments, spreading the risk among a variety of insurance
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   During OPL's first full year of operation in 1984, UPS took in
$99.7 million through EVCs and paid $22 million in claims, court
records show. The new arrangement allowed UPS to shelter more than
$78 million that formerly would have treated as taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   `SHAM TRANSACTION'
</P>
<P>
   In his written ruling, Ruwe concluded the company's
restructuring had ``no economic substance or business purpose'' and
was a ``sham transaction'' designed to avoid U.S. income tax.
</P>
<P>
   UPS cited similar Tax Court cases involving Gulf Oil and U-Haul
that had been decided in favor of the companies. UPS also argued
that it had recast its EVC business to comply with state laws
requiring all companies that sold insurance _ even self-insured
firms like UPS _ to have state insurance licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The judge dismissed that explanation, however, saying UPS
officials produced few records to show they were concerned about
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``With nothing more than the sketchy testimony about vague
concerns by (the head of UPS' insurance department, the company)
would have us conclude that it divested itself of a very profitable
$100 million per year revenue source ... that had consistently
received approval of the federal and state governments,'' Ruwe
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe (UPS) would have (restructured) a
significant portion of its business in order to avoid a potential
state law problem without having thoroughly analyzed the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies set up foreign subsidiaries in low-tax countries
like Bermuda to gain foreign tax credits that offset income from
high-tax areas, said Ernest R. Larkins, a Georgia State University
professor specializing in international taxation. By combining the
low- and high-tax income, U.S. firms can lower their overall tax
rates. Jay Carlson, a tax expert with the Washington lobbying firm
Miller &AMP; Chevalier, said the UPS case shows Tax Court judges are
increasingly likely to reject aggressive corporate tax strategies
and disregard management testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is sending a very strong message to corporate
America,'' Carlson said. ``They're drawing a line in the sand and
saying that some business practices aren't acceptable _ and some
explanations aren't believable.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be out of character for a tradition-bound, risk-averse
company like UPS to engage in questionable tax practices, said Roy
Bahl, director of Georgia State University's Policy Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time imagining that a company like UPS would
intentionally put itself in that kind of position,'' Bahl said.
``Companies have been known to make mistakes _ but so have Tax
Court judges. My gut tells me this case is ultimately going to be
resolved in UPS' favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation industry experts say the outcome of the UPS tax
dispute will have little practical impact on the company. UPS
brought in $27.1 billion in revenue in 1999 and posted operating
profits of $3.9 billion. In documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, UPS said its financial reserves are more than
adequate to meet any contingencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Black, transportation analyst at Blaylock &AMP; Partners in New
York, said the fact that UPS has had to set aside an amount equal
to about six months' earnings and face accusations that it has been
a tax scofflaw is intolerable for a company that has sought to be
above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS is one of the most admired companies in America _ and its
business is built on trust,'' Black said. ``It's vitally important
for the company to maintain the relationships it's built over the
years. A matter like this goes far beyond a simple financial
issue.''

 &HT;    Routine maintenance is a must to keep windows in good shape
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - My house has aluminum siding that's in decent
shape, so I don't have to paint the exterior walls. But that
doesn't mean I escape entirely; owners of brick-, aluminum- and
vinyl-covered houses still need to attend to window frames.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your windows have wood, vinyl or aluminum frames,
routine maintenance will help keep them working well.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional wooden windows, when properly maintained, are
good-looking and functional, and they can be good insulators when
used in pairs to create a dead air space in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden windows, though, are vulnerable to water damage and must
be protected with paint or some other surface sealant. Inspect
windows inside and out at least once a year to check for
deterioration or mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   The claylike glazing used to hold glass in the frame should be
supple and moist. Dried, cracked glazing should be removed and
replaced. Deteriorated glazing can allow moisture to enter the
window frame.
</P>
<P>
   Check the paint on frames outside the house. If the paint is
cracked or peeling or if pigment comes off when you rub a finger
over the surface, the window should be repainted.
</P>
<P>
   Wash the surface with a rag or a soft-bristled brush and a
cleaning agent such as TSP (trisodium phosphate), which can be
found in most home-improvement and paint stores. Rinse with clean
water and allow the surface to dry completely.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape off any remaining loose paint and sand the rough edges
with medium-grit sandpaper. If your sanding has exposed any bare
wood, you'll need to prime the surface with an oil-based primer.
</P>
<P>
   Use a good-quality acrylic-latex exterior trim paint to repaint
the frame.
</P>
<P>
   A common problem with inside wooden window frames is that they
are sometimes painted shut. A film of paint between the sash, the
part of the window that goes up and down, and its track locks the
window in place.
</P>
<P>
   To correct that situation, cut through the paint film along the
sash with a utility knife or a paint zipper, a specialty tool found
in paint and hardware stores. Move a block of wood along both edges
of the sash and tap it lightly with a hammer to break the seal.
</P>
<P>
   Remember both the top and bottom sashes should be able to move,
so you should unseal both.
</P>
<P>
   If the windows stick just a little, check the inside of the
track where the sashes move. Sometimes scraping away any stray
paint you find in the track will help. Wrapping sandpaper around a
small block and using it to smooth the inside of the track can be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   If the window is warped, you might have to remove and reposition
the stop, the strip of wood that forms the front border of the
window's track.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the window operating smoothly, occasionally rub a little
candle wax in the track.
</P>
<P>
   Nonwooden windows aren't as vulnerable to water as wooden
windows, but they do accumulate dirt and must be kept clean and
lubricated.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the sashes can be removed by depressing the buttons
used when sliding the windows up and down and tilting the window
out of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Place the sashes on a flat, padded surface _ a scrap of
carpeting works well _ and clean the metal or vinyl frames with a
mild detergent. Also clean the buttons that allow the window to
raise and lower and add a little light oil if the buttons are
sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Start cleaning the tracks that hold the sashes by using a small
brush _ an old toothbrush works well _ and a vacuum cleaner. Use
the brush to loosen dirt and the vacuum to suck it out. Then wash
the tracks with a mild detergent.
</P>
<P>
   To make aluminum frames look new, use a little car wax. Work the
wax in, allow it to dry to a powdery glaze and polish with a soft
cloth.
</P>
<P>
   In windows where metal meets metal, a little light oil will help
keep the window operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the window is wood, metal or vinyl, it should seal
snugly along all its edges. To check the seal at the bottom of a
window, close the window on a dollar bill. If the bill pulls out
easily, the seal is too loose.
</P>
<P>
   Add weatherstripping along the edges of the window to make them
more airtight. The type of weatherstripping varies with the type of
window you have, but remember that felt and pliable rubber usually
last longer than foam rubber, and metal usually lasts longer than
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   While you're working on your windows, assess their security. Are
the latches sturdy and in proper working order? How easy would it
be to force open your sliding windows?
</P>
<P>
   Consider key locks for windows easily accessible from the
ground. You might even want to think about security bars. Remember
that if you install security bars on your windows, you won't be
able to use the windows to escape in a fire or other emergency
unless the security bars can be opened from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the security of a wooden, double-hung window, add a
simple pin lock. With the window closed and locked, drill a pilot
hole at a slight downward angle through the top of the front sash
into the bottom of the back sash. Slip a metal pin _ a hefty nail
or screw _ into the hole. The window can't be raised until the pin
is removed from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden dowel improves the security of a sliding window. Close
the window and measure the distance from the sash to the side of
the window frame. Cut a wooden dowel about half-an-inch shorter
than the space and drop it in the track where the window slides.
</P>
<P>
   A similar trick works for a sliding door. Cut an old broom
handle to lie in the track to keep the door from sliding.

LORETTA YOUNG, LEADING LADY OF FILM AND TELEVISION, DIES AT 87
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Utah)  (See also: YOUNG-FILMS)  
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high
cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning
Hollywood beauty of the '30s and '40s, died Saturday in Los
Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in
``The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of
television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage
in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on
``The Loretta Young Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the
wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the
chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years.
The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on
screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ``The Primrose
Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon
Chaney in ``Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ``The Farmer's
Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid
who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in
the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy,
Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Her movies included ``Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ``Zoo in
Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ``Man's Castle'' with Tracy,
also in 1933; ``Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ``The
Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and
``The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise,
sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to
having had ``crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being
``susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to
moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished
autobiography:
</P>
<P>
   ``My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the
neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries _ that would have
been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women
out there who were like me _ who were willing to play by the rules,
didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie
had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband,
nice lover, no abuse of any kind _ that's what the heroes and
heroines were in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   While Young said she considered herself more of a ``movie star''
than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the
``first lady'' of dramatic television, with ``The Loretta Young
Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from
1953 to 1961, Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a
nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Young
said in a 1995 interview. ``I initially just walked through the
doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful
back of the dress.''
</P>
<P>
   So Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake
in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward
the camera. Viewers loved it.
</P>
<P>
   The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the
time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and
a formidable rival. Young said friends and advisers warned her that
if she appeared on television regularly she would be ``blackballed
out of this business'' and ``never get another job.'' But she saw
television as the ``wave of the future,'' and signed a contract
with NBC and Procter &AMP; Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic
series.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Young appeared in 165 episodes. A Roman Catholic who sometimes
spoke of her faith, she ended each show by delivering a homily to
the audience. Her show extolled ``respect for law and order and for
disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said
in her 1961 memoir, ``The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with
Helen Ferguson. ``Above all, we want to prove the strength, the
good, really, of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ``Sunday
night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on
television, earning Young millions of dollars and a reputation as
one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a
breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the
network had humiliated her through the overseas release of
introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in
outmoded gowns and hairstyles.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her
the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll
of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals
as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received
the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International
Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ``The New Loretta
Young Show'' and ran for a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began
reruns of the original show, the rights to which Young had turned
over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are
film producers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years
after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy
Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ``Uncommon Knowledge,'' that
she was the daughter of Young and Clark Gable and that she was
conceived during the making of ``Call of the Wild,'' in which the
two starred.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935 when the film was made, Young was single and Gable was
married to Ria Langham. Lewis said that Young was terrified that a
scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged
to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and
citing an unspecified illness. Later, Lewis asserted, Young
arranged her ``adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where
she had been temporarily placed.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's
account, dismissing it as ``a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the
book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw, her agent, said Saturday, ``She didn't want to ever
publicly acknowledge it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan.
6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated,
and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to
Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop,
persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit
and opened a boardinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child
extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann
and Betty Jane.
</P>
<P>
   First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put
braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly
accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, at 17, Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in
the film ``The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the
following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H.A. Lewis, an
advertising executive who later became a producer of her television
series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons,
Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Young was among the
first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when
she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox
to try working as a free-lance actress, she was blackballed by the
studios. She made only one film, ``Eternally Yours,'' with David
Niven, during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   She owned the rights to ``The Loretta Young Show'' and had
control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid
strict attention to the show's moral tone.
</P>
<P>
   During the filming for one episode, ``Come to the Stable,''
about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a
hospital for children, Young became so disturbed by swearing on the
set that she came up with the idea of a ``swear box.'' Cast and
crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the
money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way,
Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her
retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended
to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts,
her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in
``Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or
photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to
promote one of her favorite charities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean
Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994.
Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ``The
Solid Gold Cadillac.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Young is survived
by her three children.
</P>
<P>
   Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult
times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable
sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote:
``I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and
have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put
here to do, we will be prepared _ mentally, spiritually and
physically _ for our separation from this world.''

EDITORIAL: SHOW TIME FOR AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 13:
</P>
<P>
   In political analysis, the conventional question to ask at this
point in the electoral calendar is this: What does a presidential
candidate need to get from his party's national convention? Past
candidates have used conventions to show they are strong enough,
wise enough or steady enough to lead the nation. But it is hard to
think of an exact precedent for the problem confronting Al Gore as
he prepares to accept the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He will arrive in Los Angeles on Tuesday as a career politician
who clearly outmatches his opponent in governing experience, depth
of knowledge and empathy for those Americans most in need of a
government that is both competent and caring. Yet the most
fundamental task of elective politics _ connecting with people and
making them like him _ seems to elude Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it can best be summed up by calling it his authenticity
problem. Voters understand that Gore is smart. But they also see
his seeming inability to make the theatrical part of politics feel
like a genuine civic and patriotic experience. They know he is a
good protege, but wonder if he has a controlling inner authority.
</P>
<P>
   These doubts, plus the disciplined if deceptive salesmanship of
Gov. George W. Bush, have combined to produce months of erosion for
Gore. He has seen slippage in the polls, in the level of
cooperation between his campaign and the White House, and in his
confidence on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   If he is going to win the office to which he has aspired since
boyhood, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. needs to have a very good
convention on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLINTON PROBLEM. In order to create shooting space, a
basketball player has to ``get separation'' from the nearest
defensive player. Gore has to achieve a separation from President
Clinton's conduct and personal reputation in ways that go beyond
simply failing whenever possible to mention his name. Bush and the
Republicans believe that words like ``character,'' ``integrity''
and ``dignity'' are guided missiles that fly straight into the
Democratic bunker. Since defending the president against such
attacks is politically impossible, Gore has to create alternative
definitions for himself and his party on the issues of presidential
decorum and clean campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   He signaled his desire to do so by putting Sen. Joseph Lieberman
on the ticket, but having a devout running mate is not enough. The
real trick will be using Lieberman to promote policies that are
distinctively superior to Bush's in the areas of campaign finance
and opposition to special interests. Gore promised last spring to
make campaign finance reform his No. 1 domestic priority.
Lieberman, having a cleaner history, can elevate that promise into
a major attack weapon against a Republican ticket that is expected
to raise more than $200 million in soft money from corporations and
wealthy individuals. Proper use of this issue could help the
Democrats pull the John McCain independents away from the
Bush-Cheney ticket.
</P>
<P>
   If he could curb his desire for attention, Clinton could help
Gore achieve the aura of independence. That means giving a
convention speech that depicts Gore as something other than a
vessel for the Clinton legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, President Ronald Reagan helped the elder George Bush
overcome the ``wimp'' factor by hailing him as ``someone who's big
enough and experienced enough'' for the job. If Clinton is not
truly ready for Gore to have his turn, his inner grump will be
visible lurking behind whatever oratorical scrim he erects. The
president, in sum, must convince America that he believes Gore has
virtues beyond being more similar to Bill Clinton than George Bush
is.
</P>
<P>
   A CRISP AGENDA. Anyone who paid even marginal attention to the
Republican convention came away with a clear idea of what Bush
plans to do if elected. He will spend most of the surplus on tax
cuts. He will strengthen the military and emphasize a new missile
defense system. He will build a private-investment component into
Social Security and take unspecified steps to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs to leave an equally crisp paragraph in the heads of
the voters after his convention. Sen. Charles Schumer is right in
saying that Gore's paragraph has to be written around the concept
of prosperity, forcing voters to acknowledge that American families
are better off than they were under Bush's father or Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Voters should know after Los Angeles that Gore would not risk
Reagan-style deficits by spending the surplus on tax cuts. He would
use it to secure Social Security and Medicare. He would aim some
revenues at improving education and the environment. He would
guarantee a Supreme Court that would not overturn the right to
abortion. He would free the American political system from the
corrupting influence of corporate money.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a personal declaration of independence, he should
promise to provide a standard of White House behavior that would
not require either public lying or public confessions by the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   PERFORMANCE. As a member of the rock 'n' roll generation, Gore
no doubt remembers the Big Bopper's tribute to being ``real loose
like a long-necked goose.'' But the plain fact is, if the man could
loosen up he would already have done it. Moreover, he will come to
the lectern in Los Angeles trailing many unfortunate sound bites.
His early waffling on gun control and abortion financing, his
exaggerations about Clinton's place in history and his evasions
about White House fund-raising all cast doubt on the steadiness of
his convictions and identity. More than anything, Al Gore needs to
use his convention to address those concerns, and he can do so
through both style and substance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the stylistic side, no one doubts that Gore is the best
demolition orator in American politics. He will, if he chooses,
demolish Bush's budget arithmetic as thoroughly as he dismantled
Bill Bradley's health plan. The problem is that Americans do not
really prefer a counterpuncher as their first choice for president.
Further, it is a quirk of Gore's speaking style that the more right
he is, the more he irritates people. In this speech, as in no other
of his life, he needs to avoid pummeling Americans with his book
learning and talk instead about what he believes. For if you hack
through the sound-bite detritus of a 24-year electoral career, it
is possible to find the theme of a conviction that animates the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He does want a government that is caring and active without
being intrusive or controlling. In speech after speech he has
returned to his desire to be the protector of working families.
Bush has grafted onto his classic corporate Republican politics the
view that government ought to be something other than an impassive
referee that watches while the economy sorts out the losers and
winners. But that benign vision does not have to be grafted onto
Gore's politics. It is root and branch of his philosophy, the
healthier part of his inheritance from Albert Gore Sr. and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks and months ahead, Gore's political fate will be
determined by his ability to convey that conviction without
shouting, waving his arms or relentlessly flailing his opponent and
the public with yet another bunch of impeccably bundled facts. In
the end, when choosing between the guy with the smirk and the
smartest boy in the class, the voters will go for the man who seems
anchored from within by some core of incorruptible belief.

 &HT;    Valhalla: Course not fit for gods
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After two such incredible main courses in 2000 _ a
U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and a British Open at St. Andrews _ here
comes the payback. It's yet another PGA Championship at Valhalla
Golf Club this week in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   A month after a major held on the sport's most hallowed ground,
the 600-year-old Old Course and presumed home of golf, comes the
year's last one, on a property that has held one major in 1996,
generating nearly as many complaints as birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything drastically wrong with Valhalla as a
golf course; it's just not Winged Foot or Medinah or Southern Hills
or anything else dripping with history, which the PGA Championship
annually needs to keep pace with the other majors. After Pebble
Beach and St. Andrews, going to Valhalla is like riding around all
summer in a Lexus and then switching to a Chevy Nova.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, the PGA of America, which has 50 percent ownership of
Valhalla, expanding to 100 percent ownership after this year's
tournament, is saving millions in lease fees, and you need go no
further for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Sahalee in Remond, Wash., two years ago and asked to
comment on returning to Valhalla in 2000, Atlanta's Billy Andrade
said, ``I just can't believe it. I thought Valhalla was awful
compared (with Sahalee).''
</P>
<P>
   In John Feinstein's book, ``The Majors,'' David Duval is quoted
as saying, ``I think Valhalla is a perfectly nice golf course _ for
a Nike Tour event. But a major championship. You have to be
kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard has called Valhalla, a 1986 design of Jack
Nicklaus, ``good enough for a regular tour event'' after a bit of
tweaking since the 1996 PGA, but also said, ``Is it comparable to
Winged Foot? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was such a relatively simple venue in 1996 that 46 players
who made the cut ended up breaking par. Mark Brooks, who beat Kenny
Perry in a playoff, has not won a tournament since.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't remember much about Valhalla from 1996, you're not
alone. Fred Couples said he can't think of anyone who can remember
three holes there.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing away everyone at Pebble Beach and St. Andrews,
Tiger Woods is again a huge favorite. And why not? Valhalla is
pretty much basic Nicklaus stuff. Generous fairways, severe
approach areas and sloped greens, favoring someone with a power
fade.
</P>
<P>
   After making a quick practice round last Tuesday in a light
rain, the defending champion came away with nothing to reduce his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That golf course is typical Nicklaus golf course where he
gives you room off the tee, but he makes it a little more
challenging coming into the greens,'' said Woods. ``You've got to
hit some precise shots. If you're playing well, you can use the
slopes to you advantage. You can spin the ball off the slopes and
let it run an extra 10 or 15 feet. If you're playing well, the
greens become bigger because you can use the slopes to bring the
ball into the hole. If you're struggling, for some reason you tend
to catch the opposite side and the ball tends to roll away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Ernie Els, who is trying to change a trend that
has resulted in three runner-up finishes in the 2000 majors,
obviously handles a Nicklaus track well. He won last Sunday on
Nicklaus' Castle Pines course at The International.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can shoot real low scores on Nicklaus-designed courses if
you're on your game and everything goes your way and you get your
distances right,'' Els said. ``You can play safe and you can shoot
your even par, 1 under par pretty easily. But if you want to go
after it, you're going to take the risk, maybe shoot a very high
score. I did that at Valhalla. I shot a 68 in the second round and
I went out and shot a 79 in the third round.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few changes to Valhalla, which features a
front nine in a links-type, meadow area and a back nine through the
trees. New tees were built on No. 1, No. 2 and No. 6 and existing
tees at the 5th and 12th hole were extended _ all to encourage more
players to hit drivers. For viewers, a change at the par-5 597-yard
7th is worth noting. In 1996 an island fairway positioned in the
middle of a quarry was deemed off-limits by the PGA. This year,
much to Nicklaus' pleasure, the route will be open down the left
side, making the hole reachable in two and adding some thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly considering Nicklaus' game, the course often
favors a bit of a left-to-right shot. That would also fit David
Duval, if his sore back is up to it, and a player such as lefty
Mickelson. For him, it's a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of his greens tend run left-to-right, as opposed to
front-to-back,'' Mickelson said. ``So it's a very shallow landing
area and you need to bring the ball in high and soft.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's a unfortunate that the PGA of America has sacrificed
quality and history for dollars, when things start up Thursday, it
will all be relative. It will be Woods against the field and a
quest for three consecutive major victories. His place in history
will be more important than the place they are playing.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Charlie Woo is the sort of business and civic
leader one would expect to find at the head of the welcoming line
at the Democratic National Convention this week, and, in fact, he
will be, as a vice chairman of the city's host committee.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most revealing aspect of Woo's prominence and
devotion to an impressive array of community organizations is the
boards that he _ like many of the other successful people in the
city's new wave of leaders _ is not on.
</P>
<P>
   Woo will soon become the first Asian-American chairman of the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and he has helped guide groups
involved in everything from voter registration to inner-city job
development and Chinese-American political fund-raising. But even
though he is an obvious candidate, he has no involvement in the
prestigious institutions that once stood at the apex of civic life
here, the philanthropies, art museums and especially the downtown
Performing Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That represents a different world that isn't relevant to me in
the same way these things might have been in the past,'' said Woo,
a toy manufacturer. ``The power shift that is taking place here is
not just new ethnic groups rising, but a new approach to how you
get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Major public events like the Democratic convention are
opportunities for the host cities to put a well-scrubbed face
forward and for their power elite to stand on a national stage,
displaying a shared sense of civic pride and identity.
</P>
<P>
   But in Los Angeles, a sprawling concatenation of communities
with a restless multi-ethnic character, there is no single
``face,'' in the usual sense of the word. A surge of immigration
and the rapid shift toward an economy dominated by small businesses
rather than huge corporations have pushed Los Angeles into a
dizzyingly complex transition.
</P>
<P>
   The city has lost its white majority and will soon have a Latino
majority, with a swiftly growing number of Asian-Americans. But
despite these shifts, the upper crust of movers and shakers, the
power elite at the most well-recognized civic bodies, remains
heavily white and has not changed in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Performing Arts Center, formerly known as the
Music Center and once the most prestigious social prize, today has
81 board members, four of whom are minority members. There are two
minority members on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's
39-member board, and the pattern of underrepresentation of the
city's emerging minorities is similar at some other traditionally
important boards, from the Huntington Library to the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   As many leaders point out, there is no single power elite here
today, but many, some of whom are just emerging and have made it
clear they have little interest in the traditional avenues for
civic involvement, which had long been closed to them. This has
long been true for Hollywood power brokers, who have historically
shown almost no interest in the standard civic groups, and now the
attitude seems to be spreading to emerging ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the host committee for the Democratic convention limped
from one crisis to another, at least partly because there was no
longer a lengthy A-list of reliable contributors to call whenever a
financing problem arose. There have been plenty of other
disappointments, from the tepid new millennium celebration to the
city's continued failure to secure a professional football team,
all considered a product of the lack of a shared vision by a
unified power group. But the most potent symbol of the decline of
the old order was the sale of The Los Angeles Times this year to
the Tribune Co. of Chicago by its controlling shareholders, the
Chandler family, which once defined civic commitment but has now
all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few of Los Angeles' governing elites know one another
well, lunch together or golf together, or share much beyond a
conviction that the whole notion of civic leadership must be
broadened.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, in short, will be seeking to define themselves
for the new millennium in a city that has lost its unified civic
aristocracy and has yet to find a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days there was a real power structure and it was
clearly defined and you knew how to access it,'' said Gordon
Davidson, a founder and artistic director of the Center Theater
Group at the Performing Arts Center, home to many of the city's
most elite fund-raising galas. ``The sad thing now is that we don't
have it in the same way. It's a healthy sign, but it means you have
to work a lot harder.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Frankly, it's what makes being here still something
of an adventure. The question that I don't really have an answer to
is, who is setting the pace?''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Griego, an entrepreneur and a former deputy mayor, says
she grows slightly irritated when asked why the old-line boards do
not have more Latino or Asian-American or black members. In short,
she said, many elites from minority groups are frustrated that
these older organizations have not been more aggressive in courting
them. But she said that leaders who are members of minorities often
do not join those boards, even when they are invited, because their
missions did not seem to serve the ethnic population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old aristocracy is really gone,'' said Griego, who has
served on boards as varied as hospitals, community redevelopment,
the local community college system and the city's cultural affairs
office. ``It was kind of a downtown, music-center nucleus, based on
old families and huge corporations.''

   Dominic Ng, the chairman of the EastWest Bank here, said that
when he was first urged to join the high-status local board of the
United Way about five years ago, he hesitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, why should I join? They don't do much
for the Asian-American or even the Hispanic communities,'' said Ng,
an immigrant from Hong Kong. But he said he was persuaded that by
joining he could help alter the philanthropy's mission, and, with
the help of some committed board colleagues, he has. The United Way
has cut back on its contributions to traditional recipients, like
the American Heart Association, and poured money into programs that
will help train new immigrants for jobs and help them buy homes. Ng
is now the board's vice chairman. He serves on other boards as
well, but he said that he sees little need to join the traditional
boards of the old power elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those organizations have asked me, but I declined,''
Ng said. ``I feel I need first to help the poor and to really help
change the community.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Economics have exerted a major influence over these trends.
Nearly all of the Fortune 500 companies that once had headquarters
in Los Angeles, from Arco and Unocal to the First Interstate Bank,
have been acquired or have moved elsewhere. Along with this shift,
the downtown district has atrophied, as the thriving new businesses
have tended to move to other parts of the city and region.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the economy is dominated by myriad small companies. And
members of minorities have found it far easier to rise in the
entrepreneurial ranks than in the old corporate hierarchies, which
has also contributed to the changing civic architecture of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to reach out more,'' said Joanne Corday
Kozberg, the president of the Performing Arts Center. ``We need to
reach the entrepreneurial base, and by that you really mean a lot
of people of color. You have to look at where the community is
going. We may need to focus more on trade, and we hadn't done that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, of the theater group, said one irony was the fact that
his staff was far more diverse than his board, in part because it
was proving far easier to find minority artists interested in
working at the theater than in finding minority business leaders
interested in setting artistic policy. That still leaves many
people here frustrated.
</P>

   ``There is a disconnect between the changing face of Los Angeles
and the political, economic and civic leadership circles,'' said
Antonio Villaraigosa, a former speaker of the California Assembly
and a Democrat who is given a reasonable chance of becoming Los
Angeles' first Hispanic mayor in the election in 2001. ``Los
Angeles is the Ellis Island of the west. These civic organizations
really lag what is happening in the population.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the key to the changes and the city's future vitality
was not that some of the old elite organizations are opening their
doors, but that the more dynamic leaders are forging their own
paths, without feeling obliged to follow in the footsteps of the
elites of previous generations.

   Luis Nogales, a child of migrant farm laborers who was recently
named to the board of the J. Paul Getty Trust, expressed
frustration at the pace of civic change and a sobering view of the
multiple barriers that will need to fall to speed the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had too many firsts,'' said Nogales, an entrepreneur who
was the first Latino graduate of Stanford's law school and the
first Latino trustee of Stanford. ``One of the problems is that the
first step is usually for show. But I make it a point not to be the
last Hispanic member of those boards, and that takes a lot of
work.'' He added: ``It's a good start to be on a board, but it's a
start. I'm not satisfied to just get the appointment. I come with
an agenda. Making any difference means you have to work twice as
hard.''

FAA IS FAULTED OVER ITS WARNINGS ON AIRLINE CABLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J.)   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 18, the Federal Aviation Administration issued what
appeared to be an important safety notice for the world's airlines.
Federal investigators had learned that a manufacturer of cables
that work key controls in many widely used jetliners might not have
properly tested its cables. Samples checked by investigators, the
notice said, had failed to meet minimum requirements for strength.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials expected the airlines to inspect the cables, and,
if necessary, replace them. But federal prosecutors who are suing
the cable maker over its testing procedures said that the
notification system broke down because the critical information did
not reach airlines as intended. So the prosecutors took the
extraordinary step of asking a federal judge to break a court seal
on their evidence, allowing them to send letters to 500 airlines
and repair companies around the world warning them of the possible
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. French, the U.S. attorney in Syracuse, N.Y., said 46
of the letters went to airlines, including 36 domestic carriers,
although he would not identify specific companies. French, who is
in charge of the case, would not discuss the motivation for sending
the letters, but said he acted under federal law to ensure the
public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the case was typical of the FAA's lack of urgency
about cases involving potentially defective spare parts. The
agency, they say, has routinely failed to act aggressively when
alerted to possible problems with parts, chiefly because no U.S.
airline crash has ever been linked to them.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, prosecutors said airlines bought cable from
parts wholesalers and not directly from cable makers; in this case,
an obscure company called Strandflex, based near Syracuse. But the
FAA notice mentioned only Strandflex, and not the wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gilligan, the FAA's deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said the agency had handled the case
as it does scores of others when it informed airlines about the
cable. The airlines, she said, should have pushed their suppliers
to find out whether any of them had sold cable from Strandflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the airlines' responsibility to find out what parts they
are putting on their aircraft,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gilligan said, the FAA does not believe the cable
presents a threat to public safety. No flight problems have ever
been attributed to Strandflex cable, and pilots can compensate for
a snapped cable by using other control systems on the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   But the disagreement between prosecutors and federal aviation
officials _ about the degree of the cable's potential threat and
the adequacy of the notification system _ highlights a longstanding
debate over how the FAA deals with suspect airplane parts.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Burnett, a former chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board and a frequent critic of the FAA, said the agency
often seemed more concerned with public perception than with
rigorous enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a problem with perception, Burnett said, the FAA
will ``announce a program to do something about it.'' The attitude
seems to be, he said, ``Whether or not we do anything is not
important as long as people think we are doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said the Strandflex notice in part reflected the
needs of the agency to set priorities in its safety work. Diane
Spitaliere, a spokeswoman, said the agency handled hundreds of
urgent warnings each year regarding problems that could pose
immediate safety hazards. The FAA is required to address those
problems before dealing with less serious cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And even its strongest critics acknowledge that the FAA
regularly acts with speed and decisiveness when there is proof of
imminent danger to the public. Worries about mechanical flaws have
in recent years forced a series of widespread groundings of planes.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines buy millions of dollars of spare parts each year, and
the question of how to police their quality has long vexed the
agency. In the early 1990s a series of federal investigations
disclosed that companies were selling inferior parts, some of which
were deemed critical to safe flying.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Schiavo, the former inspector general for Department of
Transportation who conducted the investigations, said there was no
system in place at that time to warn airlines about the parts.
</P>
<P>
   The agency eventually set up procedures to notify airlines of
potential problems. Besides posting notices, the FAA established a
system to monitor parts, require reporting of suspect parts and
study ways of marking parts to ensure they have been properly
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the agency has posted warnings about parts from
life rafts to propellers. The FAA's Web site also warns of repair
companies accused of performing substandard work and of parts
suppliers charged with selling bogus parts masquerading as
certified equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the improvements, the new system has disappointed
safety advocates as well as industry representatives, who say the
FAA often moves too rashly in branding parts defective, unfairly
harming their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as the Strandflex case moved forward, the head of the
trade group representing aircraft repair companies raised questions
with the FAA about the fairness of the notification system.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah MacLeod, executive director of the trade group, the
Aeronautical Repair Station Association, said she told FAA
officials that their notices often failed to clearly say what
mechanics should do about the suspect parts. She said that she was
unaware of the situation involving Strandflex at the time she
talked to the FAA, but that she did tell agency officials that
manufacturers also were not often given a fair chance to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accused party needs to be given due process, a chance to
confront the evidence against them and to present evidence on its
own behalf,'' MacLeod said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The FAA took notice, she said, and conducted a broad review of
the program last year. During that time, agency records show, the
FAA did not post any notices about unapproved parts on its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan, the FAA deputy director, said the agency took a fresh
look at its procedures last year because of the industry's
concerns. The review, Gilligan acknowledged, delayed the issuance
of the notice about Strandflex, but she said she could not estimate
by how much.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, the agency concluded that it had the
authority to issue the notices, as long as there was detailed
evidence to suspect the parts were troubled. It kept, unchanged,
its procedures for notifying the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan said the delay in issuing the notice did not have any
safety implications. She said airlines are supposed to test the
strength of the cable before they install it, and that pilots can
compensate for a broken cable with other control systems.
</P>
<P>
   The view that a broken cable would not pose a critical safety
problem has been challenged by the National Transportation Safety
Board, which insisted in investigations several years ago that the
cables were crucial to flight safety.
</P>
<P>
   In many passenger jets, steel cable is used to connect pilot
controls with panels on the wings, known as ailerons. By changing
the position of the ailerons, a pilot can roll the plane to the
right or left, which is typically the way airliners turn.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1994 incident in which a failed cable caused an airliner
to roll unexpectedly immediately after takeoff from Newark
International Airport, the Safety Board argued that the failure
pointed to an unsafe condition. The FAA disagreed, saying that the
flight crew was able to return to the airport under control and the
odds of a repeat incident were minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   In a November 1995 letter to the FAA, the chairman of the NTSB,
Jim Hall, wrote: ``Although the flight tests demonstrated that the
airplane is controllable with a failed cable, the Safety Board does
not agree with the FAA's assessment that this `is not considered to
be a safety issue' and that no further action is warranted
regarding maintenance procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Further, the difficulties encountered by the Continental
Airlines flight crew that resulted from the cable failure suggest
that the possibility of a catastrophic accident is real.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Strandflex cable first arose in January 1999,
when a former employee sued the Oriskany, N.Y., company, claiming
it had failed to perform required quality tests and had used
substandard material to make its cable. The suit, which was joined
this spring by the U.S. attorney in Syracuse, led to an
investigation by the Department of Defense and the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, the employee, a former quality assurance manager,
claimed that Strandflex skipped required tests designed to ensure
strength and endurance and did not even own the equipment required
to perform some of the checks. In other cases, she said, the
company used unapproved material, like cable lubricant, to make the
cable. The worker sued under a federal whistle-blower statute and
stands to collect part of the damages if the case is successful.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Strandflex's parent company acknowledged that it was under
investigation, but said that there had never been a safety incident
involving Strandflex cable and pledged to fight all the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the woman filed her case, the Defense Department
started an investigation of Strandflex cable purchased by the
military. In May 1999, the department's inspector general issued a
safety alert about the cable, according to Donald V. McNamara, a
special agent with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department investigators tested a sample of the cable
and found that it broke at roughly two-thirds of the minimum
strength required by military specifications. In the notice, the
inspector general's office advised all branches of the military
that Strandflex cable might not have been properly tested and asked
all units to inspect their aircraft for the cable.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the Air Force found Strandflex cable in the engine
controls for a backup to Air Force Two and removed it.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA began its own investigation in August 1999. At that
time, the FAA judged that the aviation cable was a critical
aircraft part and assigned the investigation its highest possible
priority. (Gilligan said the FAA has since changed its position on
the importance of the part.)
</P>
<P>
   The FAA investigator finished his work by the fall of 1999, but
it was not until last May that the FAA posted the alert on its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   It was not obvious to airlines that they were Strandflex
customers. The cable is typically sold as part of an assembly that
includes hooks and other hardware from wholesalers who do not
necessarily say where each component was made. The companies
selling the complete assembly do so with the understanding that it
meets FAA specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, which has since removed Strandflex cable
from a number of its aircraft, did not learn about the cable until
a federal investigator called several weeks after the FAA issued
its notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A special investigator with the Department of Defense called
making a general inquiry if we knew anything about Strandflex or
had Strandflex cabling on our aircraft, and that was about June 5
or 6,'' said Linda Rutherford, a spokeswoman for Southwest. ``We
immediately became concerned and asked him to send us something in
writing with everything that he knew, and it was after we received
that that we began taking action.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest said it had replaced the cable on several of its
aircraft. FAA officials said the airline and others that had
performed the inspection found no problems.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors in Syracuse discovered the lapse, they went to
court and asked a judge for permission to warn the airlines
themselves. In a letter to Judge Howard G. Munson of the U.S.
District Court in Syracuse, prosecutors said the FAA notice ``had
not adequately reached its intended audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors commonly announce their findings after
completing an case, legal experts say a decision to warn the public
while a case is proceeding is unusual, although not unprecedented.
Typically, prosecutors do so when public safety becomes a concern
during the course of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns on whether the situation presents a life-threatening
or health-threatening emergency,'' said Zachary W. Carter, the
former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, prosecutors made the decision to send letters
directly to airlines and repair stations both in the United States
and overseas. In the letter to Munson, they said the direct notice
``served the purpose of ensuring public safety.''

GIANTS SEE BRIGHT SIDE OF ODD LOSS IN FINAL SECONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For a coach who had just watched two of his
rookies fumble away a preseason victory in the game's final
seconds, Jim Fassel did not appear too shaken in the wake of the
New York Giants' 16-13 loss here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, when he emerged from the team's locker room he was a
bit red-faced from yelling at his charges, or perhaps just
red-faced.
</P>
<P>
   How often, after all, does a game turn in the final seven
seconds on a collision between teammates when each was trying to
protect the football and the victory?
</P>
<P>
   Leading by 13-9, team members were initially relieved when
Giants cornerback Fred Lewis, a rookie from Louisiana Tech,
intercepted a pass thrown by the Jacksonville Jaguars' reserve
quarterback Jonathan Quinn near the Giants goal line. Lewis, not
sure if he had caught the football in the end zone, started to
advance the ball up field. Running laterally across the field, he
passed Jack Golden, a rookie linebacker from Oklahoma State. Golden
said later that he wanted Lewis to fall to the ground to avoid a
fumble.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Lewis sped by, Golden reached out and tackled his
teammate, knocking the football from Lewis' grasp. It rolled into
the corner of the end zone where Jacksonville tight end Brandon
Christenson fell on it for the Jaguars' game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy smokes,'' Fassel said later to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   No one bothered to ask if Fassel had ever seen a finish like
that. Fassel was the offensive coordinator at Stanford in 1983 when
the University of California made its now famous lateral-laden,
marching-band-abusing kickoff return for a touchdown on the game's
final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just an amazing way to lose a game,'' Fassel said,
though it was not apparent whether he was talking about 1983 or
2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Friday had been a regular-season game, there would have been
no effort to see the bigger picture after such a bizarre loss. But
since preseason games are intended to prepare the team for the
regular season, the majority in the Giants locker room, Fassel
included, saw mostly positives from their visit here.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants starters, for example, were disheartened, but it was
far more important to them that they had again showed progress _
they won their part of the game, leaving with a 10-6 lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rooting pretty hard on the sideline for the victory,
so I'm not going to stand here now and say it meant nothing,'' said
running back Tiki Barber, who had a spectacular game with 83
rushing yards and 27 receiving yards in one half. ``But you've got
to know that what happened was a freaky thing and not let it
overshadow everything else we came down here to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Giants have never played well here, and since it was
their only preseason game on the road, one of the team goals was to
play a mistake-free game in an unfriendly environment. The Giants,
now 0-2 in the preseason, wanted to be aggressive and show some
mental toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The game's conclusion hardly fit the bill, but in the first
half, the Giants were the better team and they revealed at least a
glimpse of what they would like to accomplish this year.
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback, Kerry Collins, was sharp, just as in
last weekend's loss to Chicago, when the starters again left with a
lead. Collins completed 10 of 19 passes for 110 yards, including a
well-executed pass to Amani Toomer for a 22-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can start to feel some things click out there,'' Collins
said. ``It's a process, but I see us making steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber set up a field goal and stunned the Jaguars with a
55-yard dash around right end that was all running instinct and a
pure burst of speed. Barber continues to make his subpar season of
1998 look like some kind of sophomore jinx.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Ron Dayne had 17 carries for 66 rugged yards at
running back. Dayne broke tackles, ran well in short-yardage
situations and made the most of small openings.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Giants' top offensive line played with unity
against an opponent known for its swarming, blitzing defense even
in preseason games. With four new members in the offensive line,
there have been a lot of questions, but for the second successive
week, Collins was not sacked and rarely even hurried.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Giants were steady, although their tackling was
occasionally slipshod. The Giants were playing without their
starting middle linebacker, Mike Barrow, who has a knee sprain, and
they also lost his backup, Pete Monty, who broke his thumb early in
the game and will miss two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways you can look at a game like that,''
Fassel said when he had composed himself enough to offer a thin
smile. ``You hate to lose it and I'm disappointed, but I'm going to
see the good things, too. And there were lots of good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the final seven seconds.

MARLINS RISE FROM THEIR ASHES TO THE .500 LEVEL
</HEADLINE>
  (WITH BBO-NOTEBOOK, attached)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Aug. 13. Do you know where the Florida Marlins are?
</P>
<P>
   Around .500, that's where they are, and that's utterly
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rapidly from the bitter ashes of the 1997 World Series
championship and their fire sale, the Marlins have become a
competitive team again, if not a contender. Putting that phrase
``competitive team again'' in perspective, this is only the second
season in the Marlins' eight-year history that they have had a
winning record after the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with where we are at this point compared with
where we've been the past couple years,'' said Dave Dombrowski, the
president and general manager, who has engineered the quick
comeback. ``We know nothing matters till you're a championship
team, and we have 50 games left in the season. But if you had told
us in spring training we'd be over .500 in August, you'd be pleased
with that. There are a lot of encouraging signs down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Marlins will live forever in baseball infamy. The first
team to reach the World Series that had not finished in first
place, they defeated the Cleveland Indians for the championship
after wiping out an Indians' lead in the ninth inning of the
seventh game, then wiped themselves out by fiat of the then owner,
Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   Dombrowski, in the most painful act of his impressive career,
dutifully dismantled the champions, trading his good veteran (read:
high-priced) players or letting them go as free agents. At the
time, it might have appeared that he was giving them away, but he
was amassing a collection of talented youngsters, primarily
pitchers, who have matured enough to know how to play winning
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround becomes even more remarkable when Dombrowski's
trade itinerary is considered. He was still making trades to shed
veterans well into the 1998 season, not much more than two years
ago. And he has not created this winning team by snatching a free
agent here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one of the key members of the team, Antonio Alfonseca.
He inherited the closer's role when the Marlins traded Matt Mantei
to Arizona 13 months ago, and he has performed brilliantly. He
leads the major leagues with 34 saves, and he has saved 59 percent
of the 58 victories the Marlins had at the start of the weekend.
Add his four victories, and he has figured in 66 percent of the
victories, also tops in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he had the potential to do it,'' Dombrowski said,
``but to say he'd put up the numbers he has would have been
presumptuous on our part. One characteristic he had was he had ice
in his veins. Look back at the World Series. He was pitching in
middle relief, and he came in and pitched scoreless ball'' _ three
games, 6 1/3 innings, no runs. `` He rose to the occasion, and he
has done that as the closer. He's been phenomenal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins plucked Alfonseca from the Montreal minor league
system in 1993. Two other relievers, Armando Almanza and Braden
Looper, were acquired from St. Louis in the December 1998, trade of
Edgar Renteria. Dan Miceli came from San Diego last winter, Manny
Aybar from Cincinnati last month. Vic Darensbourg came up through
the team's minor league system.
</P>
<P>
   The relief corps has the lowest earned run average in the
majors, 3.72.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get late into a game, that's been our biggest plus,''
Dombrowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching has generally been stingy in recent weeks. In the
eight games (6-2) before Saturday night, the Marlins had allowed
three or fewer runs six times, and in their last 15 games (10-5)
they had given up four or fewer runs 13 times.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Castillo has become the catalyst of the offense, holding
the National League's third-highest batting average, .357, the
third-highest on-base percentage, .442, and the most stolen bases,
46. He has driven in only nine runs, but the last third of the
Marlins' lineup does not give the second baseman many RBI
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He epitomizes what you look for in a leadoff hitter,''
Dombrowski said. ``He disrupts the other club's pitcher any time
he's on base, and he scores a lot of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Preston Wilson, the center fielder, is the team's No. 1 run
producer, driving in 88 runs before Saturday night, but he also is
the major leagues' No. 1 strikeout victim. With 146 strikeouts in
playing 114 of the team's 115 games, he is headed for the record of
189 strikeouts Bobby Bonds set in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll always be a high strikeout guy because he has that kind
of swing,'' Dombrowski said. ``But now the emphasis is on the
positive side _ RBIs, stolen bases, defense. He's a maturing young
person who keeps getting better and better. He's not the type of
guy to be affected by the strikeouts. He knows he strikes out a
lot. It's talked about a lot. But he's a very hard worker, and he
works at getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other developing players are first baseman Derrek Lee,
third baseman Mike Lowell and right fielder Mark Kotsay.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins have won 11 more games than they did in the
corresponding period last year and 17 more than they did in 1998,
the year after. They will not reach the playoffs this season, but
they are headed in the right direction.

THE LOSINGEST PITCHERS; CLEMENS IS HIGHEST PAID IN HISTORY 
(WITH BBN-MARLINS-RISE) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Joe Mays pitched in his last start, he is clearly one of
the favorites to win the race, but do not overlook Jose Lima. And
what is Mike Mussina doing there?
</P>
<P>
   It's the race no pitcher wants to win _ most losses of the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, who allowed four runs in a third of an inning last
Thursday for Minnesota; Lima, who won 21 for Houston last season,
and Steve Parris of Cincinnati are tied for the lead with 14 losses
each. Kelvim Escobar of Toronto has 13, and Mussina, struggling
with the dying Baltimore Orioles, is one of five pitchers with 12
losses each. Steve Trachsel, traded recently from Tampa Bay to
Toronto, has 11 losses. He won last year's race with 18 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kingman will not be rooting for any particular pitcher to
win this year's race. He'll just root, as he did with Trachsel a
year ago, for none of them to lose 20. He was the last major league
pitcher to lose 20, in 1980, and he wants to retain the
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens Is Highest Paid in History
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are not shouting it from the highest hill;
they're not even whispering it under the covers. But contrary to
George Steinbrenner's allergic reaction to establishing salary
standards, the Yankees have done just that by making Roger Clemens
the highest-paid player in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   That development was not mentioned Friday when the Yankees
announced that they have given Clemens a contract extension worth
$30.9 million. That's because the Yankees called it a three-year
deal. But Clemens has to play only two years to receive all of that
money so the annual average value computes to $15.45 million, and
it surpasses the $15 million average of Kevin Brown's seven-year
contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the previous record.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will jump up and down and insist that the two-year
computation is incorrect; they'll stamp their feet and say the
third year has to be included and that the average is really $10.3
million. But the third year is an option year _ at Clemens' option.
He can say no, thank you, not play for the Yankees in 2003 and
still collect his money for that year, $10.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Any money a player can receive for an option year that is not
exercised, either by the club or the player, is included in the
guaranteed part of the deal. The year, however, is not because it
is not known if the player will play for the team that season.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, for example, has a six-year contract with the
Boston Red Sox that includes an option for a seventh season in 2004
at a $17.5 million salary. If the Red Sox do not exercise the
option, they will pay Martinez $2.5 million. To determine the value
of the contract, that $2.5 million buyout is added to the other
guaranteed money for a total of $75 million for six years, or an
average of $12.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the
players stipulates that when it comes to free agents clubs cannot
act in concert with other clubs and players cannot act in concert
with other players. But the labor contract does not say anything
about owners acting in concert with players and their agents, and
that's what Steinbrenner has apparently done here with Randy and
Alan Hendricks, the pitcher's agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees acquired Clemens in a trade with Toronto in
February, 1999. As a player traded during a multiyear contract, the
pitcher had the right to demand a trade last November. When he did
not invoke that right even as leverage for an extension, Clemens
seemed to confirm what some baseball executives had said, that the
two sides already had an understanding about an extension.
</P>
<P>
   One person with knowledge of the Clemens development said the
contract announced Friday is a two-year deal with the $10.3 million
for the third year serving as a makeup for the lower salaries
Clemens has had in his two years with the Yankees, $8.25 million
last year, $6.35 million this. He said the two sides had reached
that understanding last year.

   Seven times Africans have won the Olympic marathon, but they
have been a barefoot Ethiopian running through the torchlit night
in Rome, and a South African miner racing into daylight after the
darkness of apartheid. An Ethiopian woman has won, too, cheered on
by expatriate taxi drivers in Atlanta, dropping to her knees at the
finish line and kissing the track.
</P>
<P>
   For Kenya, there has been nothing more substantial than one
silver medal and one bronze. It seems astonishing, considering that
the Kenyans run with such graceful domination in Boston and New
York and everywhere on the roads, bunching and surging in packs,
such elegant wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Kenya is favored to win its first Olympic marathon
at the Games in Sydney, Australia, next month. But the race comes
with a cultural twist. In a highly patriarchal society where women
play a subservient role, it is a woman, Tegla Loroupe, who is
expected to achieve Kenya's first gold medal in the marathon at the
Summer Games. She appears fragile at 4 feet 11 inches and 82
pounds, yet she is an insistent wraith, holding the world record of
2 hours 20 minutes 43 seconds and refusing to succumb to the
pressures of her country and her father to live a chattel life of
domestic servitude.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she wins the 26.2-mile women's marathon on Sept. 24,
Loroupe will not be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, in what will require extraordinary endurance,
she intends to run the preliminary round of the 10,000 meters, a
distance of 6.2 miles, at which she finished sixth at the 1996
Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenya has never had a woman win a gold medal at the Olympics,
so it would be great to be the first,'' said Loroupe, 27, in a
recent interview in New York. ``It will be a payback for all of the
struggles I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggles continue, even now. In late July, when she
returned to participate in the Kenyan Olympic trials, track
officials inscrutably entered Loroupe in the 1,500 meters, the
metric mile, a distance for which she has neither the foot speed
nor the desire to run. Like many Kenyan runners, she has had
frequent clashes with the national track and field federation. She
refused to run the 1,500, telling organizers that she would enter
the 10,000 meters even if she had to compete without a number
signifying an official entry.
</P>
<P>
   They relented. She ran the 10,000 meters. She finished first.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate her own willfulness, Loroupe tells a troubling
story of how she nearly committed infanticide as a young girl in
the western Kenyan village of Kapsait. She does not remember the
incident, but said she had been told of it by her mother, Mary
Lotuma. The story has been confirmed by Anne Roberts, who recruits
the top runners yearly for the New York City Marathon, which
Loroupe has won twice. The two are so close that Loroupe calls
Roberts ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tegla was not yet 3, she said, her mother gave birth in the
fields of the family farm to a brother named Philip and returned
home still bleeding from the delivery. Apparently associating the
newborn with her mother's pain and suffering, Tegla said she
grabbed the baby and began dragging it toward a fire in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't there, my mother wouldn't be hurt anymore,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother intervened, slapping Tegla so hard that she nearly
lost consciousness and sending her to live with an aunt until she
was 7. Her aunt had her own children, and Tegla was put in charge
of caring for an infant, even though she was a child herself.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Loroupe had little to wear, she said, and her
relatives refused to buy her clothes or send her to school.
Eventually, she could stand it no longer. One day, she took off and
ran several miles back to her mother's house, so desperate to get
away that she crossed a small stream, frightened because she could
not swim.
</P>
<P>
   Tegla had been born in a maize field, her mother going into
labor as she worked the land. When she was young, Loroupe said, she
had experienced respiratory problems, and her mother once walked
with her an entire day to the nearest hospital. By the time Tegla
was 5, she was hauling water and firewood and infant children on
her back. It is this ability to withstand great hardship, Loroupe
believes, that makes athletes from developing nations into the best
distance runners. Her own mother, she said, once told her: ``You'll
be the best. You can take the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for me to believe how strong I am,'' Loroupe
said. ``I worked so hard when I was young. Running is just a minor
thing to me, compared with what I was doing with my family. I
carried a lot of water and firewood. I had a lot of strain on my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Loroupe Losiwa, did not want her to attend school.
Or to run. He believed his daughter should live a traditional,
servile life, working in the fields, getting married at 18, having
children. It was her mother and her eldest sister, Albina, who
pushed her to get an education. Her mother had been an orphan and
taught her the value of independence. Her sister told her that if
she owned things of her own, men would not own her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father thought I would be spoiled by school,'' Loroupe
said. ``He was fearing that I would go out of the family and get
pregnant and no one would take care of me. But my mother had a
tough life, and she didn't want that for her children.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She is a distance runner, but her words come forward in short
bursts. Her speech is as forceful as her running.
</P>
<P>
   When she first came to New York, to run a 10-kilometer race in
Central Park in 1993, a bicyclist was obstructing her path, so she
shoved the bicycle aside to get to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are the workhorses in Kenyan culture,'' Loroupe said.
``They carry the country on their backs. Because of polygamy, they
are left alone to raise their children. It was a terrible hardship
for my mother. She said to me: `I wanted to leave. There was much
pain. I thought about it and then I realized that no one would take
care of my children, so I stayed.' She was determined that her
children would have a better life. My mother told me to go to
school. I always wanted to do something better than the others.''
</P>
<P>
   In elementary school, Roberts said, Tegla persuaded her father
to let her run if she got better math grades than her brother
Philip. ``It was a safe bet,'' Roberts said. ``Tegla knew she was
smarter than her brother, but her father didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When, at 12, Loroupe was sent to boarding school in the nearest
town, Kapenguria, her father demanded that she stop running. If
allowed to continue school, she would have to concentrate on her
studies. For six months, she listened, then another student gave
her away. Tegla was an accomplished runner, one girl told school
officials. Her secret was out.
</P>
<P>
   The school gave her a choice, Loroupe said. She would have to
run. If she did not cooperate, she would be forced to circle the
school track on her knees as punishment. She had no running
clothes, no running shoes, just her blouse and skirt, but she ran
anyway, even if she disobeyed her father's wishes. ``Nobody caught
me,'' she said. ``My teacher said, `She has a big mouth, but she is
a very good runner.'''
</P>
<P>
   She became a national high school champion at the middle
distances and in cross country, took college accounting classes and
became an auditor for the Kenyan postal service. In the fall of
1994, Loroupe won the New York City Marathon, running so patiently
and stealthily that the other contenders never saw her take the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first African woman to win a major marathon. When
she returned home to her village, she received gifts of livestock
and land and the now familiar welcome from women in her Pokot
ethnic group who told her: ``You showed that we are like the men _
we can do things. We are not useless.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, she won in New York again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been very important to me,'' said Catherine Ndereba, a
Kenyan who won the 2000 Boston Marathon. ``When I started running
in 1994, I learned about her in magazines. I knew she was a star in
our country and I was copying her.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 26, 1999, Loroupe set the marathon world record in
Berlin. A limited-issue postage stamp has been released bearing her
likeness. At the recent Kenyan trials, Roberts said, Loroupe was
granted an audience with the country's longtime president, Daniel
arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The sentimental thing is to believe that her achievements have
filled the sails of all Kenyan women. More accurately, she has been
merely a brilliant gust, welcoming, but only temporarily relieving.
Women in Kenya still suffer harsh economic privation, educational
disparity, job discrimination. Only nine of the 224 members of
Parliament are women, said the country's most prominent female
politician, Charity Ngilu, who in 1997 became the first woman to
run for president.

   ``We are very proud of Tegla, but until we get more women in
positions of decision making, we are not going to make an impact,''
Ngilu said in a telephone interview from Nairobi. ``When I ran for
the presidency, I was known through the media in Europe and America
much more than in my own country. I think it is the same with
Tegla.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe owns land and houses in Kenya, but she spends only a
month or two at home each year, training instead in Germany with
her longtime coach and manager, Volker Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Parasites in the food and water in Kenya worry her. So does the
rising crime rate. Last April, just before she won the London
Marathon, Loroupe had 20 head of cattle stolen from Kapsait.
</P>
<P>
   Rustling is often done with guns now, and her mother and her
older brother, Julius, were shot at as they pursued the livestock
on a 100-mile trek to the Ugandan border, Loroupe said. Eventually,
she said, a Ugandan minister who was also an ethnic Pokot had the
cattle rounded up and returned.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason not to spend more time in Kenya. She is
a professional athlete, but when she goes home Loroupe is expected
to resume old chores, hauling wood and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is an idol,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She can earn more than $1 million a year from running, an
astounding figure in such a poor country, but her personal
responsibilities are immense.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister Albina died of a mysterious ailment in 1995, and
Tegla is putting Albina's six children through school. She is also
paying expenses for two of her sisters who attend college in the
United States, and she tries to aid young Kenyan girls with running
camps and equipment. This is what Loroupe thinks she might do when
she retires, something for women in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an enormous emotional burden for someone so young,''
Roberts said. ``It worries me sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees at the Olympics. The marathon is a
women-only race, and Loroupe has run her best in the company of
men, who can pace her and protect her from the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The course in Sydney is also hilly, and hills have sometimes
pounded her quadricep muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe has also had problems with her hips, and during the
London Marathon in April her left leg went numb for nearly half the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, she has won something nearly as prized as a
gold medal _ the grudging respect and approval of her father.
During the spring, he apologized for his earlier interference, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was sorry that he did not congratulate me,''
Loroupe said. ``I blazed my own trail. He said he was sorry that he
might have spoiled my career. He knew all that I went through. He
said I was brave.''

 &HT;    IN YOUNGSTOWN, TRAFICANT VS. RENO IS NO CONTEST
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio _ In Teenie's Tavern just south of downtown,
screeching hard rock anthems by AC/DC play side-by-side with the
muddy harmonies of polka music.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the standard bar smoke and plume of white flour reaching
from the back room where the girls make pirogies, the retired
barber drinks his beer and revs up his opinion about Rep. James
Traficant, the combative Democrat who represents this community in
Congress. But first an agreement: no names, the barber insists. He
waves a hand, ``No names.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing a hell of a job,'' the 67-year-old man says
from beneath a Detroit Tigers baseball cap. ``I want to know how
many more congressmen and how many more senators have had the same
thoughts he's had but haven't had the guts to say it. About the
IRS. About Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, Attorney General Janet Reno. Last week, Traficant
appeared on an evening talk show in Washington and claimed to have
``sworn affidavits'' from people accusing Reno of a spectrum of
tawdry illegalities, starting with hiring female prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, which Traficant will not substantiate by
releasing the documents he claims to have, stirred a brief tempest
for the lawmaker who is by many accounts _ including his own _
inching simultaneously toward
</P>
<P>
   effortless re-election and a grand jury indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Traficant, who are legion in this economically
depressed area in northeastern Ohio between Cleveland and
Pittsburgh, are heartened once again by his fearlessness.
Detractors, a smaller but perhaps growing group, consider it
further evidence that Traficant is moving out of the realm of
enigmatic populist and full-throttle into the arena of shadowy
civic liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's out beyond the brink on that one,'' said state
Sen. Bob Hagan, D-Youngstown, who challenged Traficant in the party
primary last March. ``It's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the politics of thin majority rule, where a handful of
seats determines control of the House, Traficant is no outcast. As
a Democrat who often votes with Republicans, Traficant has both
parties tip-toeing around his increasingly unpredictable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Vindicator, Youngstown's paper, is less cautious. The paper
didn't repeat the charges Traficant
</P>
<P>
   leveled at Reno because he wouldn't provide documentation. But
in a column Friday, the paper's political writer likened
Traficant's attack to McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, a former football star and sheriff who gained folk
hero status in 1983 after winning an acquittal as his own attorney
on charges he took a bribe from the mob, soldiers on. He issued a
press release days after making the charges against Reno, saying he
had submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for documents as
part of his ``ongoing investigation into corruption within the
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to the many media inquires I have received this
week,'' Traficant said at the bottom of the press release, ``I have
this to say to the media: Ask Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference Thursday, Reno was asked. ``I just
consider the source,'' she said. ``I don't know where he got the
information, and since he didn't present it, I don't know anything
about it. But people say all sorts of mean things that have no
basis in fact, as these have no basis in fact, and I try to go on
and ignore them.... As Lincoln said, if I were to read everything
mean that people said about me I might as well close this shop for
business. But those were some of the meanest things.''
</P>
<P>
   A school of thought in the Mahoning Valley has it that Traficant
is simply trying to discredit his pursuers, employing the strategy
of a great offense as the best defense. By the time the grand jury
in Cleveland is ready to indict the target of the probe, an unnamed
``public official'' whom an attorney for one of the witnesses
confirms is Traficant, it will be impossible for potential jurors
not to wonder if the charges aren't retaliation for all those
``mean things'' Traficant has said.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the theory goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that argument,'' said Traficant's spokesman, Paul
Marcone. ``For years he's been a critic of the Justice Department,
that's a matter of record. This isn't something new.''
</P>
<P>
   What's new is the federal investigation into allegations that
Traficant has illegally accepted cars and other gifts from
constituents. He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
incriminating himself when he refused to turn over subpoenaed
documents earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, contractor David Sugar pleaded innocent to
charges he provided false testimony and tampered with a witness in
connection to allegations he poured concrete at Traficant's horse
farm outside of
</P>
<P>
   Youngstown without taking payment. Sugar is accused of ordering
his secretary to draw up fake invoices to show payments for the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Pat D'Angelo, Sugar's attorney, said Traficant made a ``partial
payment,'' for the $1,000 worth of concrete but insisted there was
no quid pro quo of official favors from Traficant involved.
D'Angelo, who confirmed that
</P>
<P>
   Traficant is the public official at the center of the grand jury
investigation, said Sugar and Traficant are lifelong friends.
</P>
<P>
   The other new piece of the Traficant story is that despite his
current legal troubles, Democrats and Republicans in Washington are
trying very hard to stay on his good side. The two parties are in a
tightly fought war over control of the House, with Democrats
needing to pick up only six seats to retake control of the chamber
for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the blustery Traficant presents a problem for his party's
effort because he often votes with Republicans on issues, and more
significantly because he has promised to vote for Republican House
Speaker Dennis Hastert in the speakership election in January. That
means Democrats will need to pick up seven new seats in order to
gain enough votes to choose the speaker, who sets the legislative
agenda in Congress and appoints the chairmen of committees.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that
starts Monday, pledged his allegiance to Hastert this summer, about
the same time an emergency spending bill was approved with $25
million set aside for a new community center in Youngstown. It was
the only Democrat project included in the $200 million bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who leads the Republican
National Congressional Committee, told the Columbus Dispatch
recently that Traficant is important to the party. ``We'll take
every vote we can get at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But this attitude hasn't been well received by the congressional
campaign of Paul Alberty, the Republican challenging Traficant this
year. Alberty is a computer systems consultant and former member of
the Poland Village Council who has gotten moral support, but so far
no money from the NRCC for his race against Traficant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if (the NRCC) came out against Traficant, but
right now they need him for some key votes,'' said Ed Crepage,
Alberty's campaign manager. ``It is frustrating for us. Right now
they're playing along with
</P>
<P>
   him, but that's politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And in politics, Traficant remains golden. Although he is said
to have slipped in popularity, he won more than 50 percent of the
vote in a three-way primary race that even opposing political
consultants concede was a ``remarkable'' performance.
</P>
<P>
   Voters like the barber in Teenies, or an industrial electronics
worker who also refused to give a name, believe in Traficant.
</P>
<P>
   They believe him when he says the Department of Justice is
corrupt and out to get him because he embarrassed them with his
acquittal in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   They believe he tells the truth that no one else has the courage
to tell.
</P>
<P>
   They believe he is doing his level best to help Youngstown out
of the economic slump it fell into with the closing of steel plants
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   And they will vote for him again in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a solid core of voters who if Traficant came by their
house and killed their mother they'd thank him for stopping by,''
said Leo Jennings, a political consultant who worked on the Hagan
primary campaign and now is working on the well-financed
independent candidacy of Randy D. Walter. ``I don't know what you
do with that.''

FAVRE HAS NO PLAN TO DRIVE HIS TRACTOR OUT OF TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A separate story, FBN-NOTEBOOK, is attached.) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is interesting how quickly fans forget. It was not long ago
when Brett Favre, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, could have run
for mayor in that city. Super Bowl appearances in the 1996 and 1997
seasons had revitalized football in Packersville, and Favre's
rocket arm was the biggest reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on radio talk shows in Green Bay, fans and some members of
the news media are questioning if Matt Hasselbeck, the backup
quarterback, should replace Favre. Hasselbeck will indeed be a
starter in this league. He is good, but is he better than Favre?
</P>
<P>
   Will everyone please come back to this solar system?
</P>
<P>
   If the Packers are going to make a return to the Super Bowl,
their best chance is with Favre, not Hasselbeck, who has been
impressive in preseason games mostly against backup players
(against the Jets last week, Hasselbeck completed 11 of 15 passes
for 162 yards and 2 touchdowns). But he has yet to be tested on a
consistent basis during the regular season against the starters of
top defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Favre was not thrilled when he was asked about the Hasselbeck
chatter, or the status of his sore throwing elbow. There is some
mild concern in the Packers' organization that Favre will again
battle arm and hand injuries, as he did last season, when a
severely injured thumb disrupted his passing motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought much about it,'' Favre said last week of the
Hasselbeck talk. ``As far as I know I'm still the starting
quarterback, and they're paying me for it. When they stop doing
that, I've got a tractor and you all can start talking about
somebody else. I mean, there'll be another backup quarterback that
comes in and the whole phenomenon will start over again.''
</P>
<P>
   On the persistent questions about his elbow, Favre, who was
addressing reporters from a podium during his weekly news
conference, said rather testily: ``I don't enjoy all these
questions. I don't know if any of you would be standing up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again the old backup quarterback controversy is rearing its
ugly head. No matter how many Super Bowls a quarterback wins, if he
goes through a rough stretch there are always calls for the backup.
John Elway, Dan Marino, Phil Simms, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana _
all great throwers who at one point heard calls for the understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is a reason the backup was the backup to begin
with. But perspective is always the first victim when the
controversy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It is true tendinitis in Favre's right elbow has affected his
passes in camp, as have blisters on his hand. For now he is not
throwing with that familiar Favre zip. As a result, coach Mike
Sherman has reduced Favre's throwing repetitions to rest the elbow.
He is scheduled to play only a handful of series during Sunday's
preseason game against the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Favre maintains his elbow is fine, and that if the season began
Sunday, his passes would be as deadly as ever. For the first time
in his career, Favre is following the example of great veteran
passers like Troy Aikman, who does not overwork his arm in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do anything to jeopardize my throwing for
when it really counts,'' Favre said. ``Nothing counts in preseason
except for guys trying to make the team. That's as clear as I can
state it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody right now,'' he
added. ``I just want to survive preseason. Five years ago, I
probably would take every snap. But I'm trying to be smart about it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Favre, whose 235 touchdown passes in the 1990s are the most of
any quarterback, has been an unparalleled leader with a chance of
being in the Hall of Fame. This is Favre's 10th season so it is no
wonder Favre is having some physical problems with his arm.
</P>
<P>
   But bench Favre? Now? The idea is silly.

NFL NOTES: THEISMANN; GIANTS; BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theismann Still Has Arm Strength
</P>
<P>
   Joe Theismann, the ESPN analyst and former Washington Redskins
quarterback, has been friends with Baltimore coach Brian Billick
for years. So when Theismann made an appearance at training camp
last week, Billick thought he would break up the monotony by
allowing the 50-year-old to toss a few passes to Ravens receivers,
who were being covered by the secondary while running pass routes.
</P>
<P>
   Theismann's first throw was a bullet across the middle, only
several inches too high. The zip on the ball was so strong, the
Ravens players, almost in unison, shouted, ``Oooohhhhh!''
</P>
<P>
   Theismann was not done. His second throw was a perfect, tight
spiral on a deep out pattern that was caught and led to several
veterans joking that the backups had better watch out for their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite still having a strong arm, Theismann is not about to
come out of retirement. There was a time, though, when people
wished the Ravens starter Tony Banks would try another sport. But
after a dismal stint in St. Louis, Banks is entrenched as the
starter in Baltimore, and so far the move to trade for him after
the 1998 season has proven to be a brilliant one. Banks is making
better reads and decisions and this is the most comfortable he has
ever been in an offense.
</P>
<P>
   During a scrimmage earlier in camp against a good Ravens
defense, Banks completed his first 13 passes, including a 17-yard
touchdown pass to Jermaine Lewis. Over all, including last week's
preseason game against Philadelphia, he has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped Banks that he is in the first settled situation of
his NFL career. As a professional, he has never been in the same
offensive system for two straight seasons remarkable considering
this is his fifth season. And Billick's system is extremely
quarterback friendly. Last season, Banks started the final 10
games, and finished 6-4, including a 4-0 record in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has showed that he can run our offense efficiently,''
Billick said. ``I've said all along that Tony can step to another
level if he stayed in the same offensive system for two years in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Considering Two Trades
</P>
<P>
   Are the New York Giants, usually conservative when it comes to
making trades, thinking about making two?
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the Giants pulling off one trade by the end of
the preseason are not as slim as one might believe, and neither is
the possibility of a second deal.
</P>
<P>
   First, several general managers have said, the team is
considering trading wide receiver Brian Alford, a third-round pick
in 1997. The Giants are deep at his position and Alford, though he
has shown flashes of talent at times in training camp this year,
will likely get little playing time during the season. That makes
him expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Those same general managers said the Giants, short on
cornerbacks, are considering trading for Jerry Azumah, currently
the third corner on the Chicago Bears' roster. The Bears may not
cut Azumah, and the Giants think they might be able to steal him
for a low-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have patience with players,'' said Giants general
manager Ernie Accorsi of Alford. ``This player has had no chance to
play. We have not given up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi had no comment on Azumah, and would only say Giants
scouts are looking at a number of players.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Outperforming Arrington
</P>
<P>
   The regular season has not started yet, but it is looking more
and more like the Cleveland Browns made the right decision in
picking the defensive lineman Courtney Brown with the No. 1 overall
pick in April's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Browns officials say at times he has looked like the best player
on the field. The athleticism scouts and coaches saw when he was at
Penn State is showing on the professional level.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the team debated between choosing Brown or his
college teammate LaVar Arrington, now with the Redskins. There is
no question Arrington is going to be a good player as well. But
Brown so far has a slight edge, mainly because he has been nothing
but a true professional, while Arrington irritated coaches and
players when in June he turned a one-day excused absence from
minicamp into a four-day unexcused absence. &QL;

NADEAU PEEKING OUT FROM SHADOW OF GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 By DAVE CALDWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Jerry Nadeau first jumped into a go-cart
when he was 4, and he was hooked. He loved driving cars so much
that he often slept in one to scare up enough money to keep chasing
his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad when you turn the heat on,'' Nadeau said on
Saturday morning, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nadeau, 29, a native of Danbury, Conn., has his own mobile
home to sleep in and his own fast Winston Cup car to drive. He has
finished fourth in two of his last three Nascar races, including
the Brickyard 400 last Saturday, and he is peeking out from the
huge shadows cast by Jeff Gordon, his Hendrick racing teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, things are starting to turn around and we're
starting to finish races,'' Nadeau said.
</P>
<P>
   With six straight victories on road courses and a three-race
winning streak at Watkins Glen International, Gordon will be a
focal point entering Sunday's Global Crossing at the Glen. Although
some road-course specialists are hired for this race, stock-car
drivers are better on road courses than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you didn't focus on a road course,'' Gordon
said. ``You said, `That's just one we throw out the window.' Now,
for the championship, you've got to run good everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Showers on Saturday morning forced the cancellation of
qualifying, throwing an interesting wrinkle into the race for the
Winston Cup. The cars will start in order of their Winston Cup
points standing, which means the top three _ Bobby Labonte, Dale
Jarrett and Dale Earnhardt _ will be at the front of a lead pack
that will be hard to catch.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau will start 25th, but he thinks he has a car capable of
surging to the front. He posted the third-fastest time in practice
under sodden skies on Saturday, even faster than Gordon. He posted
his best finishes here in each of his two full Winston Cup seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau's first season driving for Rick Hendrick started slowly,
with many accidents and breakdowns. Now, he said, his luck is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   He joked that he has started wearing his underwear backwards to
improve his fortunes, but added that he is doing things the same
way he did earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau has driven virtually every kind of souped-up car there
is. When he was 17 he won track championships on dirt and asphalt
at Oakland Valley Raceway in Cuddebackville, N.Y., and he once
finished second in a go-cart race on ice in that
not-so-chicken-fried racing locale, St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quick from the start,'' said Skip Barber, who runs a
racing school from which Nadeau and other drivers learned many
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But Nadeau, Barber said, was also painfully shy. He had the
talent and the push to become a good driver _ ``a sleep-in-his-car
kind of guy,'' Barber said _ but he did not have a driver's
swagger.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau found that, too. He won an open-wheel championship in
Barber's program in 1991, earned a scholarship, and stayed on a
roll. He took some public speaking courses and became less shy and
more well-spoken, always a plus in the eyes of publicity-hungry
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Nadeau moved to North Carolina to try to be a Winston
Cup driver. He remembers sneaking into Hendrick's shop to pick up
some tips. Two years later, he was in a Winston Cup car. He signed
with Hendrick at the end of last season and got sponsorship from a
dot-com company that sells building materials.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do now is win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just takes time, and then experience takes over a little
bit,'' said Tony Furr, Nadeau's crew chief. ``What's been hard for
us is that this has been a new car and a new driver. Usually, when
you make a change, you only have to worry about one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   It has helped Nadeau that he has had Gordon's expertise at his
disposal. But Hendrick, who also owns a car driven by Terry
Labonte, has never seen Nadeau as his third-best driver. Probably
more important, Nadeau has never seen himself that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry's stayed pretty level,'' Furr said. ``You can tell he's
confident _ I reckon that's the word for it. But he has a lot more
confidence than he had early, that's for sure.'' &QL;

 EDITORIAL OBSERVER: YOUNG, IDEALISTIC AND AMBITIOUS AT YALE IN THE
'60s  
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the talk of the importance of average families in the
election this year, it turns out to be a grand year for elites. The
last time a presidential race featured a candidate from Harvard (Al
Gore), Yale (George W. Bush) and Princeton (Ralph Nader) was 1912 _
the year of Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft
_ when the Ivy League was more clearly a place of privilege than it
is today.
</P>
<P>
   For Yale, however, it's a trifecta. With the selection of Dick
Cheney and Joseph Lieberman as vice presidential candidates, three
out of the four major-party nominees spent at least some of their
college years in New Haven. It is not a burning issue, but still
you have to wonder. What was there at Yale that helped incubate
these choices?
</P>
<P>
   With his reputation as a fun-loving fraternity president, Bush
fits into a popular stereotype of Yale, dating from old New Yorker
cartoons depicting the guy in a raccoon coat at a football game.
But what I find striking about the candidates is their echo of a
peculiar strain of political ambition combined with do-goodism
rampant at Yale in the 1960s, when I was a student along with Bush
and Lieberman and other budding politicians like Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Gov. George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Back then Yale, like most campuses, was a hub of idealism,
networking and, in retrospect, more than a little sanctimony. My
years there were framed by two Kennedy assassinations and filled
with civil rights activity and anti-war protests. ``There were
moments when you weren't sure about the survivability of the
country,'' says Roland Betts, one of my class' biggest champions of
Bush. ``It was not like today, when kids go through college
planning their careers and figure that everything will be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents of Yale from that era were also moral
spokesmen. Kingman Brewster's defense of the legal rights of Black
Panthers led eventually to his departure, and Bart Giamatti, my
thesis adviser, made the study of Renaissance epic poetry into a
quest for the ideal. Everything was debated in moral terms _ not
just the war and the draft, but coeducation, teacher tenure and
whether to join a fraternity or go to law school.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis Lapham, editor of Harper's and a chronicler
of the American class system, Yale has been a place of moral debate
since its founding in 1701 by ministers upset that Harvard had
strayed from its religious purity. ``The argument between God and
mammon, between doing well and doing good, is always alive and well
at Yale,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, the struggle has taken place on both the left
and right. The left of my day saw Yale as a tool of the
establishment, whereas Bush says he recalls the condescension of
the liberals, just as William F. Buckley had a generation earlier.
Yet Bush is sending his daughter to Yale this fall, just as Buckley
sent his son.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable feature of the ferment at Yale was how
Yale-like it was. There was a perverse pride in knowing that while
some Yale professors had done recruiting for the CIA and alumni
like the Bundy brothers and the Rostow brothers were helping to
prosecute the war, the anti-war movement was led by Yale graduates
like Benjamin Spock, David Dellinger and the Rev. William Sloane
Coffin Jr. I can still remember my irritation with Coffin when he
challenged a group of us to get off our rear ends _ during exam
season _ to organize a protest against Lady Bird Johnson, who was
speaking to the Political Union. We did, but the main goal, I
remember, was to make sure that the radicals didn't do something
really impolite like pull down their pants.
</P>
<P>
   The other relevant feature of life at Yale was what Gaddis
Smith, the diplomatic historian, calls the ``ethos of organized
activity.'' Smith, who is writing a book about Yale in the 20th
century, says that students have aspired to organize and lead
groups since the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of student government, Yale students joined
publications, sports teams, academic advisory boards, fraternities,
singing groups and other organizations. I was active in The Yale
Daily News and the Political Union, a campus debating society that
was sometimes ridiculed as a place of earnest and ambitious student
politicians. Pataki led the Union's Conservative Party, and Kerry
led the Liberal Party but caused a rump faction to break off in
protest against his support of the Vietnam War. Lieberman, a law
student while I was at Yale, was in a separate tradition of News
chairmen with political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, was believed to have no political ambitions.
That memory came back two weeks ago, when about 18 of his
classmates held a kind of class reunion at the Republican
convention in Philadelphia. Everyone I talked to at the party was
both proud and amazed that he had become such an extremely
effective politician. In New Hampshire earlier this year, when I
caught up with Bush, I found myself saying to him that I simply
found it incredible that he was running for president. He laughed
and said that all his classmates had the same reaction, but that it
was absurd to say he never had any interest in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, I didn't go out and join the Conservative Party,''
he said, with that familiar trace of mockery toward the Political
Union. ``But I cared about politics. Look, I'm not saying that
being president of DKE qualifies me to be president. But it shows
that I do like to accomplish things and get people to do things. I
always did.''
</P>
<P>
   To me, in running a moral crusade, Bush seems more than ever
like the child of Yale in the 1960s that he says he never wanted to
be. It sounds strained, perhaps. But it is somehow reminiscent of
Yale in the '60s that on both sides its graduates are convinced
they are trying to save the nation's soul.

FOR PIAZZA, MVP TALK IS SOMETHING TO IGNORE
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the sixth inning on Friday night, a chant began to
grow out of the stands as Mike Piazza stood in the batter's box.
The chorus of ``MVP! MVP!'' reverberated onto the field and Piazza
stepped out of the box, as if he could hide from the unwanted
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But the chant did not die down on Friday and it will likely
follow Piazza, deservedly if early, throughout the remaining six
weeks of the season. And the questions that came one after another
in the clubhouse, wondering whether he had heard the chant and what
he felt of his chances in the National League's MVP balloting, will
certainly intensify. Especially after a night like Friday, when he
once again provided the decisive blow, a two-run homer that started
the Mets to a 4-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza also looked as if he wanted to slip away from his crowded
locker and off into the night, off to any place where he would not
have to answer these questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering,'' Piazza said. ``What can you do? You just
want to play hard and just do the best you can. That's my
philosophy. Guys that have won the award, guys that lost the award,
or finished second, third, fourth, fifth, that's the philosophy you
have to have. You don't play to win that award. You play to win. If
the award comes your way, great. But you don't really go out there
thinking about it. If it has a way of just making the team better,
then great. If it fires everyone up, great. But I'm just like,
`Whatever.'''
</P>
<P>
   The chant did not grow just from another monstrous home run from
Piazza in this game, or as a reward for the 4-for-4 performance in
Houston on Thursday that had brought the Mets home from a
successful road trip. The chant could have begun building when
Piazza won the rookie of the year award in 1993, or at least since
he joined the Mets a little more than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has twice finished second in the MVP balloting, in 1996
and 1997. While he has not been able to capture the individual
honor, he has carved out a career that is certainly bound for
Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame, reaching 30 home runs this season
for the sixth consecutive year, a feat that no other catcher in
history has approached.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, he may be hard-pressed to be denied the award,
batting .349 with 31 home runs and 97 runs batted in. And while
there are still six weeks remaining in the regular season, it might
seem frightening to think that Piazza actually could just be
heating up. While injuries have limited him to 97 games this season
out of the first 114 the Mets have played, he has come back with
fresh legs and a torrid bat, batting .539 with two home runs and
four runs scored in the last three games through Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's been great all year,'' Bobby Valentine said. ``He's got
six more weeks of the regular season to give it his best, and he
gives his best every night. That's all we ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said of the MVP chase: ``The few times I've been through
it before, I don't really think about it. You can't. You just go
out and do everything you can to help the ball club win. I finished
second twice. I was honored with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even say in those years that I was thinking about it.
That's just the way it is. You just play ball and help the team
win. When the team wins, you're going to reach your personal
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Piazza reaches toward those personal goals, helping
the Mets toward another playoff berth, the team's success could
figure in his chances. His competition could come from San
Francisco's Jeff Kent or St. Louis outfielder Jim Edmonds, both of
whose teams are in first place in their divisions right now. Among
the teams not in contention, Colorado's Todd Helton and Montreal's
Vladamir Guererro have the statistics to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A winning team usually gets it,'' Piazza acknowledged. ``But
like I said, you can't think about it. I mean, there's just so many
things, especially now with the time left. I'm definitely not
thinking about it. It's flattering to mention it now, but you still
have a lot of games left. You have to keep that in mind, just keep
pressing on and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza strained to try to remember if it was this way when he
was with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the same, really,'' he said. ``Going back to
when I was rookie of the year, too, everyone was saying that you
have it already when it was just halfway through the season. I
didn't think about it. I just kept playing and tried to finish
strong and that's what I did. You can't dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza paused for a moment and added with a smile, ``How many
times did I say that?''  &QL;

<P>
   Mort said, positively, absolutely, ``There is no bait in the
surf at Amagansett, and no fish.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the bones in my right hip feeling like someone had
rasped away all of the cartilage, I wasn't much up for fishing. I
had slipped in May, gone under in a river, smacked my head on a
stone. Now it was August and I would get a new titanium hip in
three weeks. It would be a quiet family jaunt is all, son-in-law
driving, granddaughter beside me in the back seat singing, no fly
rods to complicate my life. Mort said there were no fish in the
surf, and Mort is an honorable and wise friend who is never wrong
on matters piscatorial.
</P>
<P>
   On the first morning, at the gentleman's hour of 11, I limped to
the beach and surveyed the vast, gray ocean. The tide was out, the
white breakers were a hundred yards offshore. A few terns flew
swiftly overhead, head and beak slanted down, searching; three
seagulls foraged what the sea had left.
</P>
<P>
   I dug my cane deeply into the wet sand, like Ahab his wooden
leg, and saw a hundred yards to my left a few birds clustered in
the sky. Ah, birds. To an angler anywhere they are icons and
emblems, harbingers of drama, so I hobbled north and saw that they
were dipping, darting, plunging hard into the sea. I had seen this
before, never at midday. There had to be a little bait in the water
was all, perhaps a few two-pound bluefish among it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the low tide, the particular cross-movements of the
waves, had built a vast trough or wash, some three football fields
long, one wide, and when I got close enough I could see that there
were really 40 birds, careening and plunging, making my old heart
flutter, and that some of the birds came out or the sea looking
like aerial Fu Manchus, with a curled mustache hanging from either
side of their beaks, and on the beach there were sand eels
flopping, four or five inches long, so that was what all the fuss
was about, sand eels.
</P>
<P>
   At first, I thought the two forms in the foam and vying
currents, moving parallel to the shore, were skin divers. Then I
thought they might be seals. Were there seals in Amagansett? Or
walruses? They kept moving irregularly back and forth, 50 feet in
from the breakers, their great bodies bulging the surface at times,
then disappearing, then protruding above it, now closer to the
shore, now no more than 80 feet from me _ and I was 20 feet back
from where the water reached. Wading in the suds, I could reach
whatever was out there with merely a modest fly cast.
</P>
<P>
   Striped bass. That's what was out there. Two, possibly 3
gigantic stripers, perhaps 50 pounds, maybe 60, as happy as tarpon
eating Cuban sardines, in no hurry whatsoever. They and some of the
smaller fish I now saw _ stripers, not bluefish _ had herded the
sand eels in against the shore and were systematically gorging on
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a glorious sight _ once in a lifetime: bull or cow
stripers, perhaps world records, within casting distance, glutting
on sand eels, oblivious to all else, vulnerable, a little like me
when there's a table full of strawberry shortcake.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to own 53 of the finest sand-eel imitation made. Lou
Tabory had given me a sample many years ago on a long shank hook
with silver body, short red tag, long green spade hackles _ and I
had wisely had a fine tyer in Maine make me a lifetime supply. I
had caught blues and stripers on them and knew with absolute
certainty that they would take fish in this trough. It was
comforting to know that they were safe in my fish closet, in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment I thought wildly about gimp-hopping back to the
room, corralling my son-in-law into driving me to town, buying a
whole new outfit, rushing back. No. Even a dumbbell knew that would
take at least a half hour and this freak show of nature would be
over in 20 minutes. Maybe I should call Mort on a cell phone; he
lived nearby. But I didn't have his number and I didn't have a cell
phone. So I sat down on the bench of sand that marked high tide and
watched, eyes widening, then widening more.
</P>
<P>
   A full two hours later the trough finally began to fill, the
breakers came closer to shore, the birds drifted away, and the
curtain came down on this diabolical show.
</P>
<P>
   You must know that I'm dumb, but not dumb enough to have missed
yet another fishing lesson that day.
</P>
<P>
   You know I'll always harbor a touch of hope amid the well-earned
doubts of an old fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   You know I'll never go anywhere, ever, without a fly rod.
</P>
<P>
   You know where Mort can go.  &QL;

WHEN UNMARRIED COUPLES SPLIT UP, WHAT ABOUT THEIR JOINT PROPERTY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Pina Olson and her life partner decided to buy a
Manhattan apartment together in October 1998, they put money aside
to hire a lawyer to draft an agreement that would spell out what
would happen in the unlikely event that they eventually parted. As
it turned out, Olson said, the agreement was never drafted.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved into the apartment and lived together for a
little more than a year. Then the unlikely happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved out in December,'' Olson said. ``He still lives there,
but I'm still paying half the mortgage. I can't afford not to. If
he lets it go into default, it could ruin my credit for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson, of course, is not alone. In fact, real estate lawyers
say, while life partnerships have become an increasingly common
alternative to traditional marriage, those who buy property with a
significant other should be careful to attend to legal and
practical matters first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two people are buying property together, and they're not
legally married, they almost always need to exert some effort to
protect themselves,'' said William H. Michelson, a Plainfield,
N.J., real estate lawyer who frequently represents gay, lesbian and
unmarried heterosexual couples. ``There are two basic problems they
have to prepare for. One is to decide what happens if one of them
dies, and the other is to decide what happens if they split up.''
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is relatively simple for married couples, he
said. They generally take title to property as ``tenants by the
entirety,'' a form of ownership _ available only to married couples
_ that results in title to the property passing automatically to
the surviving spouse when the other spouse dies.
</P>
<P>
   For an unmarried couple to achieve a similar result, Michelson
said, they must specifically state on the deed that they are taking
title as ``joint tenants with right of survivorship.'' With such a
form of ownership, he said, title passes to the surviving joint
tenant on the death of the other, achieving the same result that a
married couple would get with a tenancy by the entirety. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also possible, Michelson said, to pass title to property
into the name of a surviving unmarried partner by taking title as
``tenants in common'' _ whereby each partner owns a 50 percent
interest in the property _ and then drawing up wills that leave
each partner's share to the other upon death.
</P>
<P>
   Michelson cautioned, however, that buying property as tenants in
common can be tricky if the partners fail to execute wills naming
each as the beneficiary of the other, or if one or both of them
executes a will and then later changes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can end up with what I call `the wicked stepsister
syndrome,''' Michelson said, referring to the possibility that a
surviving partner may end up owning the property with a relative of
the deceased partner whose relationship with the survivor may be
strained or even hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once heirs have inherited a deceased partner's share they can
say, `We want the property sold,' and the surviving partner is
going to be hard-pressed to stop it,'' Michelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even that may be easier than dealing with an ex-partner who is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're buying a co-op, a condo, or a house, if you're
not husband and wife, the law looks at you as if you were joint
investors,'' said Stanley Simon, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
``And smart investors always have written agreements governing
their investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon said that regardless of how title to property is held by
an unmarried couple, it is essential that the couple have an
agreement that addresses the issues that often arise when a
relationship sours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement can be as simple or as sophisticated as the
situation dictates,'' he said, adding that at the least the
partners should agree on a way to settle issues of ownership if
they disagree. For example, Simon said, an agreement should
establish the ground rules that would be used if one party wants to
buy out the other's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to make sure that the partner who
is selling gets his or her name taken off the note and mortgage,''
he said, explaining that in most cases, the only way to do that is
for the remaining partner to refinance the mortgage and put it in
his or her name alone. Failure to do so, Simon said, can result in
one's credit rating being damaged if the partner who remains
responsible for paying the bills pays late or misses payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the bills get paid on time, the partner who left could
still have a hard time getting a mortgage on another house because
he or she is still obligated on the previous mortgage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement should also specify that if a buyout cannot be
accomplished without the selling partner being removed from the
note and mortgage, then the property must be put up for sale to a
third party.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Bohn, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that a
well-drafted property ownership agreement should specify how the
property is to be valued if one partner wants to buy the other's
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties can agree to use a mutually agreed upon
independent appraiser,'' Bohn said. ``Or, if they can't agree on
that, they can agree to each get their own appraiser and then use
the average of the two appraisals.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it is also important for property-ownership agreements
to contain an acknowledgment of each partner's respective
contributions to the property, including the original down payment,
improvements and repairs, and payments on the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   This is important because whenan unmarried couple splits up they
cannot go to a divorce court, which usually seeks an equitable
distribution of assets between divorcing couples. The unmarried
couple must instead file what is known as an action for partition _
a legal proceeding whereby a court orders the property sold and the
proceeds distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a divorce court, however, the court in a partition
proceeding will typically look to the actual contributions of the
respective parties in determining how the proceeds of the sale will
be divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that if one party contributes all the down payment,
makes all the repairs and improvements and pays all the mortgage
payments, there's a good chance that the other party isn't going to
end up with much in a partition action,'' Bohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he said, it is critical for unmarried partners who
own property to keep accurate records of each partner's respective
contributions over the years _ even if they have a
property-ownership agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who has toyed with the idea of filing an action for
partition against her former life partner, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first split up we tried to sell the apartment on our
own,'' she said. ``We had these young couples in love coming in to
look at it, and some of them weren't married. I wanted to pull each
of those people aside and say: Whatever you do, make sure you have
an agreement drawn up. Don't be an idiot like me. It's too
expensive a lesson to learn.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore said Saturday that in his
acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention he would
embrace President Clinton's success in presiding over the hardy
economy but send an unmistakable message that ``I'm running on my
own agenda, on my own voice and through my own experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first extensive interview previewing the address he will
give to the delegates on Thursday _ the most momentous of his
political career _ Gore said the speech at the Staples Center here
would be loaded with policy specifics because he wanted the public
to know he had a definite agenda to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he would pledge to connect with the American public
as president by constantly holding ``town meetings'' with ordinary
citizens that would become ``a major theme of my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would ``speak very concretely'' in outlining his
plan for cutting taxes for middle-class families and altering the
Social Security system, his championing of the environment and his
role ``in efforts to set time limits and reform welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm going to take the risk of going into
specifics,'' he said, ``is that I think people ought to know the
issues that are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that his decision to speak in great detail,
reminiscent of Clinton's policy-laden State of the Union messages,
was a gamble because ``the modern trend has been to resort to the
vaguest of generalities and not to challenge the audience with
specifics and hard substance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go along with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore made clear that his proposal for town meetings was intended
to help address what some of his advisers say has been his central
vulnerability: that he is not personally appealing to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the centerpiece of the way I conduct an open,
continuing, candid, no-holds-barred dialogue with the American
people throughout the Gore-Lieberman administration,'' said Gore,
who was known for holding endless public sessions when he was a
young congressman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Pittsburgh, where he was campaigning,
Gore said he welcomed the comments last week by Clinton that the
vice president should not be tarred with any scandals of the
Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate what the president said,'' Gore said. ``He
repeated what he said in the past and what many others have said:
This campaign is about the future.'' Dismissing worries among some
Democratic officials that Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were
looming over the proceedings here and distracting attention from
him, Gore said, ``This election is about the future. It is about
the choice that has to be made between Governor Bush and myself.
Anyone who doubts that underestimates the desire of the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Democrats here expressed concerns that the Clintons
have hardly slipped gently into the shadows as Gore's big week
approaches. Recognizing, perhaps, that he has dominated the
coverage in the run-up to the convention, Clinton abruptly canceled
several television interviews scheduled for this weekend. And White
House officials said they called off an interview with The New York
Times because they were furious about the newspaper's coverage of
how the Clintons are the headline attractions at fund-raising
events here that competed with Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   As delegates streamed into this city Saturday for their first
convention here since John F. Kennedy was nominated in 1960, their
overriding objective of the week was to name a ticket that would
continue eight years of their party's rule in the White House. But,
thus far, Clinton's long shadow has been the talk of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Edward G. Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said in an interview that Clinton had resisted
a Monday night speaking slot here and tried to hold out for Tuesday
because he thought it was a bigger night. Rendell, the former mayor
of Philadelphia, said he had persuaded Clinton to settle on Monday
by telling him he would draw a larger audience than on Tuesday if
he delivered his address immediately after what would surely be a
highly rated Titans-Rams football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Look, we've got to get the maximum audience because
there's nobody alive who can better explain why Al Gore should be
president than you,' '' Rendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it would not be fair to compare his task to that of
Vice President George Bush in 1988, who advisers said was
essentially offering himself as the steward of a third term of the
Ronald Reagan administration. Rather than merely continue with
Clinton's achievements, Gore said his message would be that he can
build upon the economic successes of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role that I have played in helping to shape the policies
that have continued the economic progress will, by the time I speak
at the convention, be fairly well known and understood.'' He added,
``I will make a new start to include those who have not yet fully
enjoyed the benefits of the progress we have made and upon which I
can launch this new effort to connect the American people to the
full spirit of our democracy: the open meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers said his speech would be a pivotal moment in his
stepping out from Clinton's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would mention Clinton in his address, Gore replied:
``Sure. I will say that the last eight years have been years of
such remarkable economic progress and progress in lowering the
crime rate and welfare reform, in significant measure because of
his dedication to trying to create a better future.'' Yet Gore also
said he would put forth a new vision. ``He gave us a foundation
upon which I will build, upon which I will make a new start to
include those who have not yet fully enjoyed the benefits of the
progress we have made.''

</P>
<P>
   The vice president said that while he would make contrasts with
Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney on policy, he intended to keep
his remarks upbeat. ``It will be positive, positive, positive,''
Gore said of the speech, which he drafted largely himself. ``And it
will describe a time of tremendous hope and possibility. There will
be no negative points about Governor Bush or Cheney, either overt
or covert, either direct or implied. There will be direct
comparisons of the approach Joe Lieberman and I take to the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   His pledge to stay positive in his speech, Gore insisted, was
not rooted in any concern that the Republicans would continue to
portray him as having a relentlessly negative campaign style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the American people are beginning to tune into this
dialogue, most of them for the first time,'' he said, ``it is
imperative that we elevate the tone of the campaign on both sides.
I think there's a willingness to do that on the other side. And I
hope the other side will see this convention and this speech as an
opening of opportunities for them as well as for us. The real
question is now what we get out of it. It's what the American
people get out of my speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's assurances, several Gore advisers and convention
officials said that while they were mindful that the program should
not appear harshly negative, some speakers would not shrink from
aggressively taking on Bush and the Republicans. The wide belief
among leading Democrats is that the sharp-edge remarks against
Democrats at the Philadelphia convention, particularly by Cheney,
gave them an excuse to fire back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have a lot of credibility left on that
anymore,'' said Robert Shrum, one of Gore's top advisers. ``The
Cheney and Bush speeches had a personally negative tone. Secondly,
I think you can very respectfully discuss issues, and the
differences you have on issues. People don't see that as a negative
at all. They see that as something they're entitled to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Republicans might trap the Democrats by goading
them into lambasting Bush, and then condemning them as too
negative, Rendell said: ``They had a chance but they blew that on
Wednesday night. If they had run a sweetness and light convention
on Wednesday night, it would have been difficult for us. We would
have had to tread gingerly to even do issues comparatives without
seeming negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining how this convention would address pressing matters
like education and health care, Shrum ridiculed the largely cheery
and temperate convention stages of the Republicans, saying, ``Look,
we're not trying to run an ersatz variety show. We're trying to run
a convention that puts a person, in a very serious way, before the
American public.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Saturday, Gore said he was intent on reaching
back _ to far before he became vice president _ for the public to
understand what motivated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to know that the proposals I'm making for the
future are rooted in my 24-year fight for working families,'' he
said. ``I want them to know that my proposal for regular open
meetings as president is rooted in my experience in learning from
the working families for whom I fought for 16 years in the House
and Senate. I want them to know that my passion for protecting the
environment is rooted in the battle that I've waged for almost a
quarter century.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Los Angeles said they were bracing for a livelier,
and seemingly less disciplined, gathering than the Republican
convention in Philadelphia, in part, perhaps, because of the
questions about the Clintons hovering over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said Gore had more to gain
_ and, maybe, to lose _ from the convention than his opponent
because as close as the polls are, Bush is now ahead, and the vice
president needs to scramble the dynamic.

IN SEATTLE, REPAIRING A COBBLER'S LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET KING  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A foundation whose enormous real estate portfolio is
the unlikely legacy of a onetime cobbler is bringing new life to
one of its most prominent assets _ the neglected
turn-of-the-century brick buildings in Pioneer Square. The
buildings were once hotels, offices and stores built after the
Great Fire of 1889 destroyed the wooden buildings and wharves of
Seattle's original business district.
</P>
<P>
   Workers under the strict eye of a preservation board are making
upgrades as part of a $70 million restoration of 14 buildings
between First and Third Avenues that the Samis Foundation, through
its operating arm, Samis Land Co., is transforming into 68
high-ceilinged loft apartments, 700,000 square feet of retail and
office space and a 453-space parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are part of Pioneer Square, a seven-block-long,
five-block-wide neighborhood that is home to art galleries,
antiques shops, cafes and clubs and within walking distance of
downtown high-rises directly to the north.
</P>
<P>
   All are owned and operated by a foundation created by the late
Samuel Israel, which finds itself refurbishing the buildings that
its founder had allowed to run down for decades.
</P>
<P>
   When he died at age 95 in 1994, Israel left his foundation a
portfolio of more than 500 debt-free parcels whose worth has been
estimated at more than $100 million, as well as several million
dollars in the bank. The foundation's mission is to finance
education for Seattle's Jewish children and enhance culture and the
environment in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   His collection comprises one of Washington state's largest
private commercial-property holdings, including 35 other downtown
buildings and prime industrial land by Seattle's Boeing Field
airport, timberland in three counties and homes and 1,600 acres of
ranch land in eastern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focused on Pioneer Square initially,'' said William Justen,
a major figure in Seattle's real estate industry since the 1970s
who was hired in 1996 as managing director of Samis Land Co.,
``because it held the biggest concentration of structures and was
where we could most quickly raise revenues. Some buildings had no
revenues and so were a financial and tax drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Justen said he expects to finish the Pioneer Square work next
year. ``These great old brick buildings ooze with charm,'' he said,
``and we're trying to make this the best place to live, work or
visit in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Israel was born into the Sephardic Jewish community of
Rhodes, in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece, in 1899 and
immigrated to Seattle in 1919. As a shoemaker, he had a lucrative
Army contract to repair boots during World War II, and he put his
profits into real estate through Samis Land Co. He lived like a
pauper on a cattle ranch in semi-arid eastern Washington, which
reminded him of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam felt that owning land for land's sake was a means of
security,'' said Rabbi Rob Thoren, the foundation's grants
director. ``He often acquired buildings on a fire-sale basis,
really cheap, and never sold anything. He did not believe in owing
money, so owned his real estate outright.'' He concentrated on
Pioneer Square starting in the 1940s when the district was on the
skids because the downtown core had moved northward.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel gained a reputation as a slum landlord because he
refused to repair or improve his buildings, except for the roofs.
As a result, rents in Pioneer Square were among the cheapest in the
city, attracting mom-and-pop stores and an artist culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude was, lease it as it is, you fix it or move out, I
don't care,'' said Tom Grass, leasing agent for the one of the
first Pioneer Square buildings to undergo an overhaul, the
six-story Corona Hotel at 606 Second Ave., built in 1903. The
Corona had housed an art gallery at street level but the floor was
collapsing, the heat did not work and only pigeons occupied the
dusty and deserted upper stories for the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Plasterers are putting finishing touches on the Corona's new
5,000 square feet of retail space, where Steve Perry's Willow's
Gallery will open this month. Market-rate rent for stores is about
$24 a square foot annually, while prime downtown space leases for
$50 to $75.
</P>
<P>
   In July, renters began moving into 20 loft apartments, with
13-foot-high ceilings and 1,100 square feet of space, that lease
for $1,900 monthly. Suzanne Cole, the project manager, said that
``there are few apartments like this in the city, so demand is
high.''
</P>
<P>
   A block away, scaffolding covers the Terry-Denny Building at 109
First Avenue South, which is being transformed into 48 loft
apartments and 10,000 square feet of street-level retail space.
Built in 1889 as the grand Northern Hotel when Seattle hastened to
recover from the devastating fire, it was vacant when Israel bought
it in the 1970s, and its only recent tenant was the Colour Box
nightclub. Apartments are 600 to 1,300 square feet and rents will
range from $1,080 to $2,340 when occupancy begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Israel was criticized for decades for letting his buildings
decay. Ironically, Samis this summer received bad press when it
refused to renew leases in the 110-year-old, six-story Washington
Shoe Building at Occidental and South Jackson so that it could
start rehabbing the building into apartments or offices.
</P>
<P>
   Street-level tenants _ an antiques store, a picture-frame
boutique, an art gallery and a kite shop _ reluctantly moved out.
And so did artists who had been living illegally in studios on the
five upper floors that were not in compliance with building codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artists and all of us who leased space knew we had a good
deal going,'' said Stephen Croft, owner of Elliott Bay Antiques,
who moved his shop a block away when forced out. ``But I have no
animosity toward Samis. This is not the old regime that said,
`Don't call me unless the roof is leaking.''' Croft paid Samis
$5,000 a month for 8,000 square feet of space, 85 percent of it in
the unheated basement, but now pays market rates of $4,000 a month
for 2,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had unsuccessfully tried to buy the 42-story Smith Tower,
once the tallest building west of the Mississippi. He had owned the
rest of the block between Yesler Way and James Street. Three years
after his death, Samis bought the 522-foot-high landmark at auction
after GE Capital had foreclosed on a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Lyman Cornelius Smith, of the L.C. Smith &AMP; Brothers typewriter
company, which later became Smith Corona, had constructed the tower
as the showcase for the business district, but by the time it was
built in 1914, downtown was moving north. Smith also owned a
shotgun-manufacturing company.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, ``paint was peeling, there was no air-conditioning, it
was not well-wired, cobwebs were everywhere and it looked like no
one moved a piece of furniture in 30 years,'' Grass recalled. It
had small tenants and lawyers who had been there for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Samis spent $28 million to restore the Smith Tower to its
original elegance, with marble walls, bronze windows that open and
a 35th-floor banquet room furnished with gifts given by the Empress
of China in 1914 in return for typewriters and guns. It still has
manually operated elevators, but it is now one of the city's most
high-tech office buildings, with fiber-optics and wireless
communication, and it has attracted some dot-com companies that
like the funky neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Samis placed the heat and air-conditioning in an adjacent
building so the tower's basement could become a health club, and it
is constructing a 453-spot parking garage across the street to
serve tenants.
</P>
<P>
   While the Samis Foundation is the beneficiary of the real estate
portfolio, the costs of rehabilitation of its buildings to bring
them up to modern standards is high. Samis awarded $2.5 million in
grants last year to its Jewish endeavors and will give $3.5 million
in 2000. ``We will grant out of operating income for many decades,
not by selling property,'' Justen said. But, he added, ``There also
is enough development work in our portfolio to last a lifetime.''

QUANN, 16, MOVING UP THE LIST AND TOWARD AN OLYMPIC MEDAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ On a closet door in her bedroom, 16-year-old
Megan Quann keeps a list of the world's fastest times in the
100-meter breaststroke. As she climbs the list, she crosses off one
time, then another.
</P>
<P>
   Each night as she goes to bed, Quann lies down with a stopwatch
and swims the perfect race in her head.
</P>
<P>
   She imagines herself in the waiting room with her competitors,
marching onto the pool deck, climbing onto the starting block,
leaning forward, legs bent in a sprinter's crouch. She starts the
clock and the race begins in her mind, stroke by stroke, the
bobbing torso and froglike kick, and when she hits the stop button,
she has broken the world record.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Heyns of South Africa, the 1996 Olympic champion, has swum
1 minute 6.52 seconds, swifter than anyone, but Quann imagines
going even faster this year, 1:05.49, or even 1:04.70. She is
impatient and bulletproof with youth, while Heyns has struggled
with her confidence and her stroke. The whispers say that Heyns may
not even compete next month at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   If Heyns does show up, she will lose, Quann said Friday night
after winning the 100-meter breaststroke in 1:07.26 at the Olympic
trials. In Thursday's preliminaries, Quann swam 1:07.12, the
fastest time in the world this year and a U.S. record. She will be
the Olympic favorite in Sydney, and she has the predatory sense
that Heyns is uncertain, vulnerable. She speaks of the Olympic
champion as if she were a milk bottle in a midway game of softball
toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going down,'' Quann said of Heyns. ``She's 26 or
27. I'm 16. I'm going to race my heart out and I'm going to win
that gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Quann will be a junior this year at Emerald Ridge High School in
Puyallup, Wash. She is at an age where failure is unknown and
everything is possible. The American freestyle sprinters are in
their late 20s or early 30s, but many breaststrokers have not yet
been to the prom. The outward kicking motion of their specialty
requires great flexibility, and it is the young who are most pliant
in the hips and knees.
</P>
<P>
   Success comes fast and fleeting. Anita Nall set a U.S. record in
the 100 breaststroke at the 1992 Olympic trials and finished 38th
in the semifinals of the 2000 trials. At 14, Amanda Beard won the
trials in 1996 and took an Olympic silver medal. At 18, she
finished eighth, dead last, in Friday's 100-meter final.
</P>
<P>
   At the trials here four years ago, Beard carried a teddy bear on
the pool deck as a good luck charm. This year, she showed up with a
pierced tongue and punctured innocence. Success that early _ and
blazing and brief _ left her with a dislocating convergence of
celebrity, self-induced pressure and anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all those people watching you at the Olympics, you put a
lot more pressure on yourself to live up to everybody's
expectations,'' Beard told a Los Angeles Daily News reporter at the
trials. ``Then you think they expect you to swim the way you did in
the Olympics every time you get in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Quann is not at that stage yet. She is naive and tunnel-visioned
and fearless. It is not arrogance or cockiness in her voice, her
mother said, but rather a belief that if she makes her goals
public, she will somehow achieve them. Megan has always been
competitive, Erin Quann said of her daughter. Once, on a family
cycling trip, she had to ride a single-speed bike and pedaled
furiously to keep up with the 10-speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to be right in there,'' Erin Quann said. ``That's
her view of the universe: `If I put it out there and say it, it's
going to happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her taste for competition, Megan said, grew out of sibling
rivalry with her older brother Michael, who is 18. Her parents,
too, are athletic. Erin Quann was a classical ballet dancer who
received a scholarship to the Joffrey Ballet. Tom Quann, an
electrical engineer, played and coached water polo at Washington
State University. Megan tried ballet for a while _ she played a bon
bon in ``The Nutcracker'' _ but preferred the pool to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   As do other swimmers, Megan lives a life of rigorous discipline,
a certain obsessiveness always attendant to greatness. Pool time is
scarce in Puyallup, so she spends two to three hours a day
traveling to and from practice in a car or a swim club van. This
past school year, she was up at 4:30 a.m. for swim practice from 6
to 8 a.m., school from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., gym training from 2 to
3 p.m. and swimming again from 6 to 8 p.m.. She swims about 15,000
yards a day; one day two years ago, she said she spent 11 hours in
the pool and swam 50,000 yards, a distance longer than a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Quann does not get home until 9 p.m., having to eat
dinner and get to bed at 10 p.m. Last school year, to prepare for
the Olympics, she reduced her course load to four classes and used
her swimming to gain credit for physical education. The principal
required her to log 90 hours of training in a semester to qualify
for credit; she turned in 543 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the principal told her 90 hours, she kind of chuckled,''
Tom Quann said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her parents say they have raised the proper caution flags on
this race toward a gold medal. They have hired a nutritionist to
monitor their daughter's diet. Erin Quann is herself a registered
nurse and massage therapist. Because Megan will miss six weeks of
class this fall to attend the Olympics, she took four courses this
summer, including calculus, to get a head start on her junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to cover all the bases,'' Erin Quann said.
</P>
<P>
   With family hiking trips, movies, trips to the mall, she said,
Megan balances swimming with normal teen-age diversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want her to be as well-rounded as possible,'' Erin Quann
said. ``You've got to realize this is her passion. We haven't
pushed her. Swimming is something she wanted to do. When you have
that passion, we are not going to hold her back. You've got to let
everyone live their life and experience their passion.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion that comes from climbing into bed each night with a
stopwatch, swimming the perfect race in her head, hoping to
transfer that perfection from her mind to the pool in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of a race is self-confidence,'' Megan Quann
said. ``I do the work in practice. You have to be prepared. I'm
having so much fun. This is the time of my life. I've made it to
the Olympics.''

LIVERY CAB DRIVER SUSPECTED OF SEXUAL ATTACKS IN QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since last summer, a livery-cab driver has been
preying on women leaving Irish pubs in Queens and in Manhattan, the
police say, driving them to secluded spots in northern Queens,
where he rapes or sexually abuses them.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives identified a suspect in the attacks as Cesar Vicuna,
28, a citizen of Ecuador, and released his photograph on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six assaults took place from July to October 1999.
The attacks apparently resumed July 8, and the latest was reported
on Aug. 6. That incident involved a 25-year-old woman, who hailed
and entered a white livery cab. While in the car, the woman fell
asleep. She woke up with the driver on top of her in the back seat,
where she was raped, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks all took place between 2:30 and 4 a.m. in various
locations in Queens, a short distance from most of the bars where
the women had been. The victims ranged in age from 23 to 31.
Several were raped, the police said, and at least two were punched
and kicked.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Malley's, an Irish pub where the police say Vicuna picked
up a victim last summer, customers were upset to hear that the
crimes had started again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I want to go home, I want to go home,'' said Allison
McGready, 28. ``The cabdrivers are in full control of the car. If
one of my drivers is a lunatic, how can I stop him?''
</P>
<P>
   At a strip of Irish pubs in Queens, many women expressed
concern. ``If you can't take a cab, what's the alternative?'' said
Yvonne Wood, 22, who was sitting next to her boyfriend in Donovan's
Pub. ``There is no alternative. I would think to take a cab before
I do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the block, a half-dozen livery cabs waited outside Sean
Ogs, a crowded bar. A woman said Vicuna's photograph had been taped
onto a wall in the women's room.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Santangelo, the bartender at Donovan's, said that the bar
usually called cabs for women, but would be doing that even more
often now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have someone preying on young women at night out here like
this is completely disturbing,'' he said.

WILLIAMS IS IN A RACE TO GET BACK ON THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Ferrari and McLaren continue their battle for Formula One
supremacy at the Hungarian Grand Prix Sunday in Budapest, the two
teams threaten to lap the rest of the field. The gap between the
top two teams in the constructors' championship is the smallest it
has been at this point in the season in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari has 102 points, and McLaren is four points behind. The
third-place Williams team is another 76 points behind _ the biggest
gap between second and third at this stage in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just astonishing,'' said Frank Williams, owner of the
Williams team. ``And it burns us.''
</P>
<P>
   It is more astonishing because in the last 20 years, Williams
has won 16 of the 40 available constructors' and drivers' titles.
McLaren has won 16, while Ferrari and Benetton have three each and
Brabham 2.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to Williams?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has happened before,'' he said. ``It happens to everybody,
and when we do get to the top again, it will probably happen again.
That wicked word competition won't go away, and that's why we're
all here trying to beat each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has not won a race since Jacques Villeneuve won the
Luxembourg Grand Prix in September 1997; it is the longest period
without a victory in the team's history.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams has been involved in the sport since the 1960s,
he founded his current team in 1977 with Patrick Head, a part owner
and the technical director.
</P>
<P>
   Head says he thinks Williams, 58, can climb back. In addition to
being an astute businessman _ a necessity in today's Formula One _
Head said Williams was ``fundamentally an enthusiastic racer.''
</P>
<P>
   The icy look Williams is seen to wear on television as he
watches his drivers race may contribute to his reputation for being
hard on drivers. But the team's titles, nine for the constructors
and seven for the drivers, also reflect his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   At McLaren, under the direction of Ron Dennis, who has a
reputation among his drivers for benevolence, the numbers are the
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his reputation came largely because twice in the
1990s, he dropped drivers the year they won the world championship.
The contracts of Nigell Mansell and Damon Hill had ended, he said,
and they had asked to be paid too much.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that he had great admiration for drivers while
they were on the track, which comes through when he talks about the
one he admired the most of those who drove for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alain Prost never ever went quicker than he had to,'' Williams
said. ``Once or twice he had to push himself on qualifying. And
while he was always very smooth, his car, you could see it, was
dancing. It was just hanging onto the road and it was fuss-free.
When he was on, he was devastating. He had some deficiencies, but
very, very clever. And gifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was talking in the Grand Prix paddock in Spielberg,
Austria, propped up to a standing position in his extendible
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1986, while driving to the airport from the Castellet
circuit in the south of France, Williams lost control of his car
and had an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down,
and with little use of his arms or hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before my accident, I was extremely energetic physically and I
was ubiquitous within the company and within the paddock,''
Williams said, his words coming out quietly and, as always, with
the appearance of great physical effort.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the 1986 season, but the team won the constructors'
title, and in 1987, when he returned, it won both titles with the
driver Nelson Piquet.
</P>
<P>
   Then followed a period of rebuilding as the team began a
relationship with Renault, which became one of the most successful
in the sport. They won the constructors' title five times in the
1990s. The team also won the drivers' title in 1992 and 1993 with
Mansell and then Prost.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy struck in 1994 when Ayrton Senna, who had just joined
the team, was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, the
season's third race. Williams and Head were charged with
manslaughter by the Italian justice system, which claimed the car
was faulty. After five years, they were exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the constructors' championship in the tumultuous
year of Senna's death with Hill and David Coulthard driving. Then,
in 1996 and 1997, Williams won both titles, with Hill and
Villeneuve.
</P>
<P>
   The team then lost its designer, Adrian Newey _ who joined
McLaren and designed that team's championship-winning cars of the
last two years _ and its engine supplier. This year Williams joined
up with BMW, the German engine constructor, which returns to the
sport after a 12-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll all take longer than people would like,'' Williams said.
``When it is firing on all 10 cylinders again, we will be a serious
team. Time frame, one year, two years.''

 OH, BABY, HAVE WE GOT PLANS FOR THIS OLD DUMP, OR WHAT? By JENNIFER c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given enough time, fantasies about the Fresh Kills
landfill on Staten Island could overtake one's life. The space has
housed a garbage dump for 52 years, but in January the landfill is
supposed to close, and public officials, college professors and
Staten Islanders have been embroiled in debates over what to do
with the 3,000 acres left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Guy V. Molinari, the borough's president, has asked traffic
consultants to submit plans for a new highway, which would connect
to existing roads used by trash trucks, to ease congestion.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't a new roadway a little uninspired? And all the chatter
about public parks and ballfields is earnest and fine, but the city
already has a lot of those.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, how about a giant center devoted to a specific,
underappreciated art form _ say, ``Riverdance''? Or what about one
big storage space, where all New Yorkers could, for a small fee,
house all the stuff kept in what most Americans commonly refer to
as the hall closet?
</P>
<P>
   Or a giant television studio, perhaps for exclusive use by all
those really bad shows that revolve around the antics of freakishly
thin women who live in huge apartments with kitchen islands?
</P>
<P>
   There is the small problem of potential toxins _ the Sanitation
Department is required to monitor the site for 30 years after it
closes before houses can be built and people can actually live
there. But what if that problem suddenly went away? What would New
Yorkers dream of for Fresh Kills (outside of a more inviting name),
if all impediments, including horrific emissions, were somehow
removed?
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business
Improvement District, said: ``Something many people don't know
about Fresh Kills is that hundreds of acres of it have never been
touched. At roughly four times the size of Central Park, it is a
huge, huge opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton is on the board of the Municipal Arts Society, which is
sponsoring an international design competition to ponder these very
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some would-be urban planners, when posed the question, demurred
_ Conan O'Brien, for example, does not do landfills, his publicist
said. Joey Buttafuco was dying to comment, his spokeswoman said,
but he had never heard of Fresh Kills.
</P>
<P>
   But here are what others who have given the issue some thought
would love to see on the Fresh Kills site of the future:
</P>
<P>
   Clark Wolf, restaurant consultant: ``A road is a boring idea. It
would be so wonderful to have organic teaching gardens, where
culinary students could see what comes from the earth. There would
be all kinds of flowers and trees and plants, but all of them
edible. And there is nothing better than compost for produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Hardin, senior vice president for creative brand management
at Saks Fifth Avenue: ``I think it is a tremendous opportunity for
a day prison for cell phone abusers. It is so well deserved for
those who use them on trains and restaurants. All we need is for
the mayor to empower us all to make citizen's arrests, and then we
would send them there. I bet you people will learn to stop this
heinous abuse,'' like the man on a commuter train he heard
hammering out divorce terms with his wife on his mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenberg, managing director of the Drama Department, a
theater company: ``I am seeing a giant amusement park. Instead of a
tunnel of love, there would be a tunnel of trash. The roller
coaster would go over all the stuff that people once threw away.
There would be carnival games, where people pull the bottle up from
a trash heap, or throw baseballs to break dishes. A community
garden would be sweet. But no.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Roldan, artist: ``A giant new museum for new artists _ of
course including myself _ changing every season to reflect the
weather. It would show the people in the world that New York art
can be about more than Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a real
estate brokerage: ``Staten Island's newest golf course _ with
diaper ditch and trash traps. Or maybe there could be a Chelsea
Piers of Staten Island. You know, something fabulously athletic!''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Bennett, bartender at Gallagher's Steak House on West 52nd
Street: ``No more tract homes. Staten Island has enough of those. I
would like a park, like Central Park, but no zoo.''

BUSH EMPHASIZES SPENDING ON MILITARY 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Ariz.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Having campaigned with Sen. John McCain of Arizona to
appeal to swing voters, Gov. George W. Bush enlisted him Saturday
to try to reach out to veterans and other Americans concerned about
the country's military might.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at the Water's Edge in Everett, Wash., Bush
reiterated his pledge to spend more on the armed services. ``I wish
I could turn to the soldiers on that ship,'' Bush said, erroneously
referring to the sailors on an aircraft carrier in the backdrop,
``and I wish they could hear me: Stay in the military, there's a
new commander in chief coming.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Navy fighter pilot and prisoner of war in
Vietnam, vouched for Bush's credentials on the issue. ``I have
total and complete confidence in a man whose father served this
nation honorably, who served honorably in our National Guard,''
McCain said, alluding to Bush's Vietnam years, which were also
spent as a fighter pilot, albeit in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Then McCain, who often jokes that being shot down in Vietnam
threw doubt on his aerial prowess, added, ambiguously, ``He wasn't
a much better pilot than I was, frankly.''

GORE INVOKES THE SPIRIT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL PIONEER   By DAVID c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGDALE, Pa. _ If there is an issue in which Vice President
Al Gore feels he has a decided edge over Gov. George W. Bush, it is
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has written a best-seller on the subject; he has the
endorsements of the major environmental groups and, as he loves to
note, Bush presides over a state that consistently ranks at or near
the bottom for air and water quality.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, with some polls showing him gaining ground on Bush,
Gore stood on a ridge overlooking the Allegheny River and claimed
spiritual kinship with the late Rachel Carson, the author of
``Silent Spring,'' widely regarded as a founding document in the
environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   Carson was born here, an Allegheny Valley town 12 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, and Gore came here intent on drawing
parallels between her life's work and his own passion for the
environment. Like Carson, he said, he spent time in his youth
wandering his family's farm in Carthage, Tenn., ``looking for
critters'' and learning to love nature.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how, when he was a teenager, his mother bought a
copy of ``Silent Spring'' and then spent the next few weeks over
the breakfast table discussing with Gore and his sister, Nancy, the
book's warning against pesticides and other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Where Carson had started studying the environment as a
teen-ager, publishing her first article at age 14, Gore recalled
studying at Harvard University under professor Roger Revelle, a
pioneer in researching the atmospheric effects of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago,'' Gore told several hundred people gathered
on the lawn of a high school here, ``I joined with the spirit of
Rachel Carson in committing myself to a new springtime filled with
the sounds of wild birds, with the sounds of children learning
about and appreciating the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson's work has been criticized by chemical manufacturers and
some prominent scientists. She has been accused of overstating the
case against pesticides, of abandoning objectivity for bitter
polemics. But her main findings about the dangers of pesticides to
the environment continue to have broad acceptance, and Gore again
drew a parallel with his own 1992 book that warned against the
dangers of global warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she published `Silent Spring,' she was the target of a
very well-orchestrated, well-financed attack from special interests
that were profiting from pollution,'' he said. He mocked industry
advertisements showing children walking through clouds of
pesticides to demonstrate their harmlessness, and likewise, he
said, he had been the target of similar corporate ``propaganda''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I published `Earth in the Balance,''' he said, ``I became
the subject of a lot of attacks, and I want you to know I wear
those attacks as a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Gore's performance here on Saturday amounted to
a routine stump speech on a favorite subject, it also demonstrated
something about his overall campaign strategy. Gore, several of his
aides said, is determined to blend the rhetoric of environmental
awareness with his larger populist theme of ``fighting for the
people'' and taking on big business.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy aimed chiefly at Bush, whom the Gore campaign
has accused of being a captive of big oil.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy is also aimed at Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate and Green Party candidate who, according to some polls,
has been eating into Gore's voter base with appeals to
environmental advocates and union members, particularly in the
Midwest.

FEW TUNED IN, BUT POLL SHOWS CONVENTION STILL HELPED BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even though few Americans watched two hours or
more of the Republican National Convention, a new study shows that
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas succeeded in increasing awareness that
he favors a bigger tax cut than does Vice President Al Gore and
wants prescription drugs available to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Polling conducted after the convention for the Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania found that only
about one American in five watched two hours or more of the
convention, while 67 percent said they watched a few minutes or
none at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of television watching and other news
coverage increased the knowledge of some of Bush's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, 54 percent of the public identified Bush
as the presidential candidate who ``favors the biggest tax cut.''
After the convention, that reached 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also before the convention, 25 percent knew that Bush favored
providing vouchers to defray some of the costs of prescription
drugs for the elderly. After the convention, 31 percent said the
Republican nominee did.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also succeeded in communicating a message about Gore.
Before the Republican convention, 39 percent knew that Gore opposed
allowing workers to invest some of the Social Security taxes in the
stock market _ something Bush favors. Knowledge of Gore's position
reached 44 percent after the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the public learned one thing that Bush may not have
intended. Although only two speakers all week used the word
abortion, the percentage of the public that said Bush wanted to
make it harder for women to get abortions increased from 52 percent
to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg center and of
its yearlong project involving about 100,000 polling interviews on
Americans' political opinions, cited this finding in particular as
evidence that news coverage and not just the convention itself
helped people learn about the candidates. Abortion figured heavily
in coverage of the Republican platform in the days before the
convention and when the platform was adopted on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson said the increases in knowledge extended to people who
did not usually pay attention to politics. ``The convention may not
have reached many Americans directly,'' she said, ``but the event
did stimulate many to pay attention to the presidential campaign.''

   CVN-CONVENTION-RDP (Los Angeles) _ As the Democrats prepare to
open their first presidential nominating convention in Los Angeles
since John F. Kennedy was picked here in 1960, party leaders are
measuring how much distance President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore should seek to put between them. Obviously, Gore wants credit
for the robust economy but nothing to do with the impeachment
scandal. Picking and choosing could be difficult. Meanwhile, Rep.
Loretta Sanchez is back on the convention program after agreeing to
drop plans for a fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion. Party leaders,
nervous about any hint of salaciousness, has pressed her to find
another site. By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGDALE, Pa. _ If there is an issue in which Vice President
Al Gore feels he has a decided edge over Gov. George W. Bush, it is
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has written a best-seller on the subject; he has the
endorsements of the major environmental groups and, as he loves to
note, Bush presides over a state that consistently ranks at or near
the bottom for air and water quality.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, with some polls showing him gaining ground on Bush,
Gore stood on a ridge overlooking the Allegheny River and claimed
spiritual kinship with the late Rachel Carson, the author of
``Silent Spring,'' widely regarded as a founding document in the
environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   Carson was born here, an Allegheny Valley town 12 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, and Gore came here intent on drawing
parallels between her life's work and his own passion for the
environment. Like Carson, he said, he spent time in his youth
wandering his family's farm in Carthage, Tenn., ``looking for
critters'' and learning to love nature.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how, when he was a teenager, his mother bought a
copy of ``Silent Spring'' and then spent the next few weeks over
the breakfast table discussing with Gore and his sister, Nancy, the
book's warning against pesticides and other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Where Carson had started studying the environment as a
teen-ager, publishing her first article at age 14, Gore recalled
studying at Harvard University under professor Roger Revelle, a
pioneer in researching the atmospheric effects of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago,'' Gore told several hundred people gathered
on the lawn of a high school here, ``I joined with the spirit of
Rachel Carson in committing myself to a new springtime filled with
the sounds of wild birds, with the sounds of children learning
about and appreciating the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson's work has been criticized by chemical manufacturers and
some prominent scientists. She has been accused of overstating the
case against pesticides, of abandoning objectivity for bitter
polemics. But her main findings about the dangers of pesticides to
the environment continue to have broad acceptance, and Gore again
drew a parallel with his own 1992 book that warned against the
dangers of global warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she published `Silent Spring,' she was the target of a
very well-orchestrated, well-financed attack from special interests
that were profiting from pollution,'' he said. He mocked industry
advertisements showing children walking through clouds of
pesticides to demonstrate their harmlessness, and likewise, he
said, he had been the target of similar corporate ``propaganda''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I published `Earth in the Balance,''' he said, ``I became
the subject of a lot of attacks, and I want you to know I wear
those attacks as a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of Gore's performance here on Saturday amounted to
a routine stump speech on a favorite subject, it also demonstrated
something about his overall campaign strategy. Gore, several of his
aides said, is determined to blend the rhetoric of environmental
awareness with his larger populist theme of ``fighting for the
people'' and taking on big business.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy aimed chiefly at Bush, whom the Gore campaign
has accused of being a captive of big oil.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy is also aimed at Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate and Green Party candidate who, according to some polls,
has been eating into Gore's voter base with appeals to
environmental advocates and union members, particularly in the
Midwest.

DON ETTLINGER, 86, SCRIPTWRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif., Mich., Ill.)   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Ettlinger, a writer for film, television and theater, died
Monday at a hospital in Nyack, N.Y. He was 86 and lived in Pomona,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ettlinger was born in Detroit and attended Stanford University
and the University of Chicago. While still an undergraduate, he was
hired by 20th Century Fox in Hollywood and, at 21, became one of
the youngest contract writers on the Fox lot.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ettlinger's early projects, written with Karl Tunberg,
was the 1938 film ``Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,'' starring Shirley
Temple. With Tunberg, Ettlinger also wrote ``Shipyard Sally''
(1940), which was based on a story by Gracie Fields, Tom Geraghty
and Val Valentine, and was a writer of ``The Great American
Broadcast'' (1941).
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Ettlinger was in the Army Signal Corps,
stationed in Astoria, Queens, where he made secret Army training
films. After the war, he wrote for radio, including the
long-running crime show, ``The FBI in Peace and War.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, Ettlinger worked for Studio One
and Kraft Television Theater. He was also a writer on the series
``Mama,'' which starred Peggy Wood. Some of the episodes were
written with his wife, Katrina Ettlinger, who survives him. He also
wrote scripts for soap operas, including ``Love of Life'' and ``The
Secret Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   With Anna Marie Bartow, Ettlinger wrote the libretto for
``Ambassador,'' a Broadway musical adaptation of Henry James' novel
``The Ambassadors,'' which starred Howard Keel and Danielle
Darrieux.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughters, Keren
Saks of New York City and Victoria Ettlinger of Shokan, N.Y.; a
son, Mark, of Los Angeles; and four grandchildren.

   BEL AIR, Md. _ Every minor leaguer has a major league dream.
This is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner's plane, en route from Tampa, Fla., to New
York, is forced to land at the tiny Harford County airport near
here. Impatient, feeling baseball-deprived, the Boss dials the
radio until he lands at the tiny community station, WHFC-FM 91.1.
He is mesmerized by the local game he hears, the quickness, depth,
savvy, desire, the power to use the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   He growls at an assistant, ``Who is that guy and why isn't he at
Yankee Stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   That guy, the dreamer, is Neal Conan, the 50-year-old rookie
play-by-play announcer of the Aberdeen Arsenal, a first-year
expansion club in the independent Atlantic League. Like Conan, the
players are not kids, most of them struggling to be rediscovered
after being cut from major league farm teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Conan, who gets to dream out loud, has had 23 years in the
major leagues, as an executive producer, a host, a prize-winning
foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, from which he is
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, while preparing for a live broadcast from the
Democratic convention in Chicago, his attention was caught by the
Cubs' broadcasters on his hotel television. He thought: That isn't
so different, I can do it. He began taping play-by-plays in front
of a silent TV screen. For the past three seasons, he moonlighted
as the part-time second voice of the Bowie Baysox.
</P>
<P>
   And on the night of Aug. 5, he was climbing the metal ladder to
the roof of the tiny press box at the tiny home field of the local
community college. An old friend, me, handed up his cables, mikes,
headset, Comrex Hotline, Shure mixer, Sony DAT recorder, all of
which, he explained, will ``squirt the broadcast signal down a
telephone line from the ballpark to the radio station'' and back
out to an unknown number of listeners, including Conan.
</P>
<P>
   He broadcasts with the backfeed echoing in his ears; it is the
only way he can be sure he is really on the air. Because his cell
phone is a different area code from the station's, he is not sure
that someone there will call long distance if there is a problem.
If indeed there is someone there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this,'' I said, minutes before the game, ``seems like a
midlife crisis to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said Conan, cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   He paced the press box roof, waiting to begin his pre-game show
with a taped interview. He had melted Maleke Fowler's reserve by
dubbing the 25-year-old outfielder ``the discourager'' for having
hit a leadoff home run in the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discourager,'' I sneered. ``Talk about ingratiating
yourself with a subject. Did you call Saddam Hussein `the heavy
hitter?' Some Bosnian jackal `the cleanup man?'''
</P>
<P>
   Conan, who was captured and held for a week by the Iraqis while
covering the Iran-Iraq war nine years ago, smiled serenely through
a graying red beard. ``It's true, I never said, `What a great
ambush.' Reportorial detachment is good, but it's nice to finally
be for something. I want these guys to win, to do well. I got
rushes covering wars and political conventions and the impeachment
hearings, but this is all by myself, filling three hours on the
radio, feeling really alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Conan screamed into his phone: ``Why aren't we on the
air? It's Neal. Pick up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the first Lehigh Valley Black Diamond was at
the plate that the connection was made and Conan was alive again.
It was easy to imagine his clear, dryly friendly voice in a larger
market. His delivery is crisp, seamless and authoritative, if a
little forgiving; he tends to excuse overrun pop flies as lost in
the late-evening shadows. But there is no false enthusiasm and no
irony. He has also learned that it is one thing to inform listeners
that the 26-year-old pitcher Zac Stark read Updike and Hesse on the
last bus trip, another to extol someone's wife and kids back home
when that someone is dating locally.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``family entertainment'' as much as it is organized
baseball. Independent league teams, with no responsibility to
develop players, can concentrate on winning games and profitably
building a community audience. Seats are $12 and $8 (children under
5 and in Little League uniforms are free). Cal Ripken Jr., who was
raised in nearby Aberdeen, is part owner of the club and is
building a fancy ballpark with a baseball academy attached.
</P>
<P>
   Conan is thinking bigger, too; commentaries on his minor league
life are broadcast every other Friday on NPR's ``Morning Edition''
and will fuel a book, entitled ``Play by Play.'' That might get
Steinbrenner's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still the bushes and far from home. His two
college-age children and wife, Liane Hansen, an NPR anchor, live
outside Washington, too far to commute. She says he looks 10 years
younger, and he says he is happy, but he has had twinges as the
political season heated up. Was he doing the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' Conan said, ``a fan asked me to sign his glove.
That never happened at a convention.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   G. Warren Schloat Jr., a writer and illustrator of children's
books who also worked on several of the classic films from the Walt
Disney Studios, died July 30 at a hospital in Escondido, Calif. He
was 86 and lived in Rancho Bernardo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schloat wrote and illustrated 22 children's books, including
``Andy's Wonderful Telescope,'' ``Fay Gow, a Boy of Hong Kong'' and
``Playtime for You,'' published mostly in the '50s and '60s by
Charles Scribner's Sons and Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades earlier, after attending Santa Monica Junior
College, he began to work his way up the ranks of the Walt Disney
Studios, first as an animator, where his deft hand captured cartoon
subjects like Donald Duck and Pluto, and later as a story editor,
where he contributed to classics like ``Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,'' ``Dumbo'' and ``Pinocchio.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of World War II, after a short stint in the Navy
during which he made training films, Schloat moved to New York and
took a job as a writer and photographer for Look, where he mastered
the magazine's photo-essay format. Working as a writer and director
in the early days of television, he devised commercials for Schick
razor blades and Gleam toothpaste for the Compton and William Estes
agencies. In the '60s he founded Warren Schloat Productions Inc.,
an educational publishing company based in New York, which was sold
to Prentice Hall in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In his retirement, he assisted his sons in the creation of two
educational publishing companies, Sunburst Communications Inc.,
which was sold last year to Houghton Mifflin, and Human Relations
Media Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Virginia L. Schloat; two
sons, G. Warren III, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and Anson Wilson, of
Bedford, N.Y.; a brother, Don, of Valley Center, Calif.; and five
grandchildren.

BRENDA REILLY, 62, COACH AND ADMINISTRATOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Calif.)  By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brenda Reilly, a teacher, sports administrator and three-sport
coach in a career of almost three decades at Central Connecticut
State University in New Britain, died of cancer at a hospice in
Branford, Conn., on Aug. 5. She was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly first gained a degree of prominence as a member of the
Raybestos Brakettes fast-pitch softball team in the 1950s and '60s.
The team won scores of national and world championships, and its
members encouraged Reilly to attend college, pointing her on a
career that made her a well-known coach and athletic administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brenda joined the Brakettes at 18 right out of high school and
worked at the Raybestos factory in Stratford for a number of years
while playing for the team from 1956 until 1965,'' said Mickey
Macchietto Stratton, one of her teammates. ``Most of us were either
college graduates, in college or about to go to college, and we
encouraged her to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, an infielder and pitcher on the Brakettes, finally
heeded her teammates' advice at the age of 26 and enrolled at
California State University, Los Angeles, said Kathy Pullek,
assistant director of sports information at Central Connecticut
State. ``By the time Brenda was a senior member of the women's
basketball team, she was 30 and three years older than the coach,''
Pullek said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Reilly received a master's degree in physical education
at UCLA. The next year, she came to Central Connecticut as a
physical education teacher and a basketball, softball and
volleyball coach. She held those positions for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, she received a doctorate in physical education from
Springfield College. From 1996 until her death, she was Central
Connecticut State's associate athletic director and senior women's
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   While she was the women's basketball coach, Central Connecticut
reached the quarterfinals of the Division II NCAA tournament in
1986 after posting a 24-4 record, and Reilly was honored as coach
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was a longtime high school and college basketball
official, and she served on a number of NCAA committees that
examined issues related to the Title IX gender-equity laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who was born in New York City, is survived by three
brothers and 17 nieces and nephews.

CLAUDE HOPE, 93, WHO NURTURED THE IMPATIENS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Costa Rica)  By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when the shady patches of America's gardens
were virtually a horticultural no-man's land: drab expanses where
gardeners planted the laconically blooming hosta and hoped for the
best, or just threw up their hands and put in ferns or coleus.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, in other words, when the impatiens _ at least,
as it is now known _ did not exist. Before Claude Hope, a
horticulturist who died July 14 at the age of 93, noticed a gangly,
lopsided flower growing wild in Costa Rica and thought he might be
onto something.
</P>
<P>
   If such a time seems hard to remember, it is because the
impatiens is now the No. 1 bedding plant in America, so plentiful
that if the word ubiquitous did not exist, it might have to be
invented.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, who died at his 200-acre farm, Linda Vista, in the Costa
Rican village of Dulce Nombre de Jesus, was known among many
gardening enthusiasts as the father of the impatiens. It was Hope
who in the 1960s, through years of breeding and hybridizing, turned
the unruly impatiens of the wild into the compact, reliable mass of
blooms that now poke their heads up _ too often, its detractors say
_ in yards, window boxes and public spaces across North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had never been a plant that bloomed in the shade to such
profusion and color,'' said George Ball Jr., chairman of the W.
Atlee Burpee seed company.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Hope was born May 10, 1907, in Sweetwater, Texas, where
he grew up on a dairy farm. In 1941, when the Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor, Hope was working for the federal Agriculture Department in
Maryland. He was drafted into the Army and immediately put to work
on a project to develop an American supply of quinine, needed to
treat malaria among soldiers fighting in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese and Germans had seized control of most of the
world's supply of the drug. But the United States was able to fly 4
million seeds for Cinchona ledgeriana _ from which quinine was made
_ out of the Philippines, before it fell to Japan, according to a
profile of Hope by Allen Lacy that appeared in Horticulture
magazine in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hope was sent to Costa Rica with the sprouted seeds and asked to
help create a cinchona farm. Although the project failed,
scientists were able to produce synthetic anti-malarial drugs. In
the meantime, Hope had become entranced with the rugged beauty of
Costa Rica and the possibilities it held for starting a big seed
company.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Costa Rica for good after the war, when he helped
found the PanAmerican Seed Co. In 1953 he established Linda Vista,
which over the years grew from a six-employee operation to a
sprawling enterprise employing more than 1,000 people. It is one of
the biggest flower seed producers in the world. Hope retired as
president of Linda Vista in 198, but continued to work on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, who never married and has no immediate survivors, was
widely known as El Capitan _ a reference to his Army rank _ and he
patrolled his farm in khakis and a pith helmet, a walkie-talkie
strapped to his waist.
</P>
<P>
   His first success was a red petunia called the Comanche, and
Hope worked with a wide variety of other plants, from daisies to
melons. He dreamed of producing pepper plants that would yield
fruit of varying color, and tomato plants with flowers big enough
to be considered ornamental. But it was the impatiens that changed
the face of American gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Hope had noticed the flower, which originated as a river plant
in Africa, soon after arriving in Costa Rica during the war. ``A
successful breeder has to be a good observer,'' he told The
Washington Post in 1992. ``You have to know every characteristic of
the plant, and you have to watch it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Through trial and error, he set about developing a plant more
suited to North Americans' gardening needs. The result was a white
flower, the first in the F1 Elfin series of impatiens. This was
followed by the Super Elfin series. Now there are an estimated 900
species of impatiens, in numerous colors and, increasingly, varying
shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever pleasure it has brought untold gardeners, the flower
has also engendered a bit of scorn among some.
</P>
<P>
   ``People to have a tendency to be contemptuous of what is
familiar,'' said Lacy, now the editor of Homeground, a newsletter
for gardeners. ``And the impatiens certainly are familiar: They
bloom their heads off.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he never turned on the impatiens, Hope, too, was a
critic of his industry, and especially the powerful role played by
the marketing departments and their customer surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A survey can't tell you what people might buy in the future,
if it happened to be available,'' Hope told Horticulture. ``So the
hybridizer, the seedsman who has his eye cocked to the future, has
got to take risks, to use his imagination to dream up something
new, and then work his tail off trying to make it a reality.''

HAITIANS CRY `ASSASSIN' OUTSIDE HOUSE IN QUEENS
</HEADLINE>
 By   AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ High-pitched wails and angry shouts pierced the damp
quiet of a Queens neighborhood Saturday morning as about 30 people
gathered at the home of a former paramilitary leader from Haiti to
protest his presence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the white stucco house where the former leader, Emmanuel
Constant, has lived on and off since 1994, several women shouted
``Assassin'' and ``Murderer.'' They shook and gyrated and bent to
the ground, watched by police officers in a van and on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toto is a criminal,'' the women shouted, using the name by
which Constant, the former leader of the right-wing Front for the
Advancement and Progress of Haiti, is commonly known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must go,'' the crowd responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to give up,'' said Mimose Lambert, one of the
women leading the chanting. Constant's group has been accused of
killing and torturing thousands of supporters of Jean-Bertrand
Aristide in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Haitian and human rights groups has tried to
persuade the U.S. government to extradite Constant to Haiti for
trial. And this is not the first such protest demanding his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage at his presence in a mostly Caribbean neighborhood
prompted the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detain him
for a year. He was abruptly released in 1996, raising suspicions
that Constant, who has said he was a paid informer for the CIA,
struck a deal with the U.S. government: his freedom for his
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Florestal, 64, a host of Radio Soleil d'Haiti, a station
in New York, said Constant's life of relative impunity symbolized
the way the United States had too often treated Haiti and its
people. Without accountability for those who tortured, maimed,
terrorized and then fled to exile, Florestal said, the victims
could not heal.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about 20 protesters walked to Rigaud Realty, where
Constant has been employed as a licensed real estate broker. They
carried posters of Constant in a suit and tie flashing the victory
sign, and they were trailed by six cars, including one with a
poster showing a body by a pool of water and a message that the
dead person was a victim of Constant's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame, shame, shame on you, Rigaud,'' the protesters shouted
outside the Realtor's office. The owner, Patrick Rigaud, was inside
but would not comment. A worker said Constant had not been there in
three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the protesters suddenly began chasing a car that
they said was driven by a man who had just threatened that he would
``be back to take care of'' them because they supported Aristide,
the priest and former Haitian president who was ousted in a coup in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Constant is not the only Haitian with ties to the country's
repressive past believed to be living in Queens. At one point
during the protest, outside Constant's home, members of the crowd
spotted a man they said had been a senator in Haiti during the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminal,'' they yelled. ``Criminal.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The police say they are ready. They've chopped
down trees that could be set on fire, uprooted newspaper racks that
could be used as battering rams and fenced off a good-size patch of
downtown Los Angeles with tall, silver swaths of chain-link in an
effort to keep any protests at the Democratic National Convention
from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators say they are ready, too. They're building
puppets to protest corporate greed, practicing passive resistance
and media techniques, sharing organizing tips over the Internet and
warily watching the police cars that circle their ``convergence
center'' near MacArthur Park. They pledge, as one of their Web
sites puts it, to ``celebrate and renew our resistance to corporate
globalization, militarism, poverty, starvation, campaign finance
corruption, sexism, racism, homo/trans-phobia, criminalization of
youth, environmental destruction, prison industrial complex,
genocide,'' and that's just for starters.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians? They're nervous, but hoping for the best:
hoping that protests stay peaceful, that freeways stay open, that
the police department that made ``Just the facts, ma'am'' famous
keeps it cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been assured by all the law enforcement entities that
everything's in hand, and that they're prepared for all
contingencies and that everything's going to work out fine,'' said
Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Convention
Committee and the overall organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to peacefully coexist with the demonstrators. They
have every right to be heard and we have every right to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean there hasn't been wrangling, or that there
won't be more. On Friday afternoon, a federal judge issued a
temporary restraining order barring the city and the Los Angeles
Police Department from seizing any puppets or written materials
from the headquarters of an umbrella protest group, as the
authorities did in Philadelphia. In addition, the judge, Dean
Pregerson of U.S. District Court, barred officials from entering
the demonstrators' offices on the basis of purported administrative
and building code violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a loud and clear message that the Constitution will
not be suspended while the convention is in town,'' said Dan
Tokaji, a lawyer for the local chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, which had earlier successfully sued the city to
force creation of a designated protest site in clear view and
hearing of the delegates entering the Staples Center, where the
convention will be held. The city's initial plan was to fence off
protesters in a parking lot well across the street and out of
direct view. ``We believe this order will be more than adequate to
protector protesters' speech rights,'' Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tokaji said: ``We remain very fearful. This
department has a long history of violating people's civil rights,
and we're very concerned about the us vs. them mentality that the
LAPD brass has adopted. We believe that's actually harmful to the
cooperation that will be necessary for things to go smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Los Angeles does not have a public culture of robust
political activism or a tradition of large street demonstrations,
and its police department is seldom called on to handle the kinds
of raucous gatherings that are par for the course in New York, for
example. The videotaped image of Los Angeles officers beating the
black motorist Rodney King remains indelible, and nearly a decade
after the adoption of measures intended to improve police training
and discipline, the city is facing the threat of a federal civil
rights lawsuit from the Justice Department, which alleges a pattern
of widespread police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But top officials here insist that the police are prepared for a
firm but measured response, one that could very well involve a
variety of nonlethal weapons from tear gas to rubber bullets,
pepper spray or paint-ball guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see the most professional police enforcement
ever,'' Mayor Richard J. Riordan said in an interview this week.
``It's not just the LAPD. It's also the FBI, the Secret Service,
the county sheriffs, the highway patrol. Everybody's working well
together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elise Hogue, a spokeswoman for the umbrella protest groups,
D2KLA and DAN (which stands for Direct Action Network), said that
it was difficult to estimate how many protesters, from a disparate
range of loosely connected groups, might actually converge on the
city. But she said the estimate of 50,000 offered by some city
officials in the past was wildly overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going for somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' Hogue added in an interview
from the group's base near downtown. ``Everything is going as
planned. We're making some beautiful puppets and hoping they
survive. But you can't really walk outside our door without seeing
a policeman or an individual patrol vehicle cruising around.''
</P>
<P>
   The police planning has been under way for more than a year, and
one of its principal goals has been to foster better cooperation
than in some past crises, like the 1992 riots that followed the
acquittal of the officers in the King beating. In that violence,
interagency cooperation faltered, but now officials say there are
clear plans. Sheriffs' deputies, for example, will be on hand to
process demonstrators if mass arrests are necessary, leaving patrol
officers available to stay on the streets, while highway patrol
officers will provide security on delegates' buses.
</P>
<P>
   City and Democratic officials acknowledge that their biggest
concern is not the area around the Staples Center itself, which is
compact and can be sealed off, but the possibility that a relative
handful of demonstrators could create disruptions in widely spread
out areas of this widely spread out city and seriously disrupt
traffic on freeways or buses at hotels. Protesters have hinted that
their prime targets might include corporate office towers that have
nothing to do with the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of traffic disruptions or blocked buildings, top
Democratic organizers say they are prepared to wait out
demonstrators rather than provoke violence too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the LAPD that we can start the convention
sessions late if we have to,'' one senior planner said.
</P>
<P>
   Because delegates are so dispersed (the longest round trip from
delegate hotels to the Staples Center is close to 50 miles), Los
Angeles poses special challenges. Event Transportation Associates,
the private concern organizing the transportation planning for the
Democrats, says the longest one-way travel time has been clocked at
1 hour and 40 minutes. Nearly 300 buses will shuttle nearly 10,000
delegates, donors and friends of the party to and from 76 hotels in
seven cities.

A MAVERICK COUPLE CHRONICLE THEIR CRUISING VENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1969, when Lin and Larry Pardey set out from Southern
California aboard the 24-foot Seraffyn, their engineless self-built
wooden cutter, they traveled on the winds of modest expectations.
``We'd never had a reasonable holiday in our working lives and we
just wanted to do something that was all about sailing,'' Larry
said. ``The thought of cruising around Mexico for a few months with
time off was just cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, the act of sailing _ and the art of
chronicling their adventures _ remains the axis around which the
Pardey's peripatetic lifestyle spins. With 11 books and four videos
to their credit and more than 100,000 miles of voyaging behind
them, Larry, 60, and Lin, 56, show no signs of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started out our motto was `As long as it's fun,''' Lin
said. ``I guess now it's `As long as we're able.' But we're still
having these crazy experiences and they're always different.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Pardeys slipped into Newport, R.I., on the
29-foot-6-inch Taleisin, which Larry built from teak and black
locust, and which the couple moved aboard in 1983. Having left the
sweltering Chesapeake Bay about a month before, the Pardeys swung
north using one of the basic guidelines that is crucial to all
their routing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like it there,'' Larry said. ``Too hot. And we'd
been invited to a classic-boat rendezvous in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we took off and brought our home with us. How many people
can do that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Pardeys have been an inspiration to plenty of neophyte
voyagers. But their devotion to ultrasimple, cost-conscious
voyaging has also been ripe for both lampooning and criticism,
particularly from those who believe cruising boats must be equipped
with hefty diesel engines and copious electronics. ``Well, we see a
lot of people out there who spend all their time fixing their
refrigeration and stuff,'' Larry said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pardeys' writing career started when, in the early '70s and
anchored with Seraffyn among a dozen similarly modest boats near
the Panama Canal, Lin read a magazine article that stated the
perfect size for a cruising boat was 57 feet. In anger, she zipped
off a rebuttal letter. It led to the birth of a career that has
financed countless adventures.
</P>
<P>
   And Larry insists it was economics, not philosophy, that led
them to sail Seraffyn without an engine, a practice they have
continued with Taleisin. ``When we first set off we could live in
Mexico for $200 a month,'' he said. ``The way we looked at it, a
$3,000 engine cost 14 months of freedom. We never dreamed of going
cruising and being comfortable, we just dreamed of going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pardeys also have some steadfast opinions on the state of
long-distance voyaging. For navigation they carry two sextants but
forgo Global Positioning System navigation, which most mariners
insist is a necessity for contemporary cruising. And they believe
that many sailors, especially inexperienced ones, are being subtly
coerced into buying equipment they do not need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put the word safety on some of this gear and it's like
saying the word motherhood; it's sacred,'' said Lin, who knows that
her views are controversial. ``So, some sailors can't figure out
what they need and what they don't need. And they don't set out
until they buy all the so-called safety gear they can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that people aren't being told to learn the
necessary skills to give them confidence, to learn how exciting and
safe and maneuverable a sailboat can be,'' she said. ``An extra
block and tackle to rig a preventer on the boom, a spare halyard, a
kerosene lamp if you lose electric power _ that's safety gear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pardeys are also not fans of the long-distance cruising
rallies that have become so popular in the last decade, in which
groups of boats _ for a fee _ travel the globe in packs for
security and companionship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine, but a lot of these people are in such a hurry
that they're irresponsible,'' Larry said. They get someplace, drop
the anchor and go ashore for a guided tour. Their boats are
unattended and if they drag anchor and hit someone, it's no big
deal. They have insurance. But it's a problem for the people they
run into.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as they ease closer toward retirement age, if not spirit,
the Pardeys find themselves working about six months a year and
traveling for the balance. They are also involved in charity work
on the Chesapeake Bay, and will open their simple, remarkable boat
to the public during the U.S. Sailboat Show in Annapolis, Md., in
early October.

DEVELOPER COUNTS ON HUGE MALL TO DRAW TOURISTS (AND MONEY) TO
SYRACUSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.Y., Tenn., Minn., Maine, Mo.)  By LESLIE EATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many parts of the country, a proposal for a super-duper
tourist-attracting mega-mall would be greeted with howls of
protest, followed by reams of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Syracuse, N.Y., where many people are embracing the mall
plan as a way to save their ailing city. Their praise, however, is
less enthusiastic than resigned; a popular sign at a public hearing
last month was, ``Do You Have a Better Alternative?''
</P>
<P>
   The mall could well become the largest shopping center in the
country. Its developers, the Pyramid Management Group, plan to
triple the size of their existing mall, the Carousel Center, and
turn it into 103 acres of stores, entertainment outlets, with
hotels, restaurants and even an aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   The current 1.6 million-square foot mall would be expanded to
4.5 million square feet; the leader in the enormous mall
sweepstakes, Mall of America outside Minneapolis, is 4.2 million
square feet, although there are plans to expand it, too. But
metropolitan Minneapolis is four times the size of Syracuse, which
has a population of only 735,000 (and fewer than 390,000 within 10
miles of the mall, while Mall of America has more than 900,000).
Minneapolis is also far more prosperous. The average household
income around the Mall of America is about $66,000, compared with
about $47,000 for households near the Carousel Center, according to
data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of malls, full of movie theaters, skating rinks and other
attractions, are in the works across the country, the council
reports, but none as big as the one proposed for Syracuse. And,
almost all are being built in booming areas.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse has only recently emerged from a decadelong recession.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mall's supporters concede that Syracuse seems an
unlikely place for a mammoth mall. ``Intuition tells you this isn't
going to be that great,'' said Vito Sciscioli, the commissioner of
economic development for the city, from which the developers are
seeking tax breaks for the $900 million project. But, he said,
consultants hired by the city to evaluate the plan told him,
``You've got a hot one here.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Tourists. The mall's backers believe that millions
of tourists will go to the center, bringing lots of cash into
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Luring them, the developers say, will be stores with outdoor
themes, catering to hunters, campers and fishermen. After all, L.L.
Bean draws hordes to Freeport, Maine, and the Bass Pro Shop is
``the largest tourist attraction in the state of Missouri,'' said
Bruce A. Kenan, a partner at Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists do seem to visit giant malls, especially those that
bill themselves as theme parks. Opry Mills, which opened in
Nashville in May and attracted 100,000 people on its first day,
says that about 30 percent of its visitors are not from Tennessee.
Foreign tourists account for more than 5 percent of the visitors to
Mall of America.
</P>
<P>
   Developers must court travel agents and tour operators and
travel writers, however. They spend a lot to attract people, said
Therese Byrne, who writes the newsletter Retail Maxim. ``Is Pyramid
set up to do that?'' she asked. She added that she was a little
dubious of the hunting and fishing theme, noting that 80 percent of
shoppers are women.
</P>
<P>
   The developers themselves concede that were they not based in
Syracuse, they would not be pursuing the mega-mall project. ``If
you didn't have the emotional attachment, you wouldn't do it,''
Kenan said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment may help Pyramid calm fears expressed at the
public hearing and in letters to the Syracuse newspapers that the
mall expansion will be a windfall for Robert J. Congel, Pyramid's
founder.
</P>
<P>
   The developers said they would expand the mall in stages, with
construction beginning next spring. They say that the current mall
is already drawing 17 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   The mall sits on the site of an old junkyard, an area where in
the last century, water from saline springs evaporated. The land is
still so marshy that the mall does not sit on pilings but actually
floats on the soupy ground; water is pumped in or out to keep it
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Pyramid, which pays almost no real estate taxes now, has asked
Syracuse to defer levying any such taxes for 30 years. The
developer would then make payments in lieu of taxes to pay off
tax-exempt bonds, which would finance road improvements and parking
garages. Mayor Roy Bernardi and the developers have agreed on the
deal, which is now under consideration by city and county
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Syracuse have suggested that that the city would do
better to grab the real estate taxes on the current mall, rather
than give them up for three decades to help finance a bigger mall.
``Their gut reaction is that we need more property taxes to pay the
bills,'' said Minchin G. Lewis, the city auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the city would get relatively little money from the
mall's property taxes, but quite a lot from sales taxes, and could
get a lot more if the mall succeeds. ``The city's being asked to
give the developer a baseball bat and hope it hits a home run,'' he
said. ``If it strikes out, we don't lose anything.''

doctors made such a spectacle of themselves. But it is fitting.
Laser surgery has all the requisite postmodern elements _
technology, a quick fix, a sense of new beginnings, low risk. So
why not celebrity?
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, Dello Russo operated on Ford live on ``Good
Morning America.'' ``I was talking back and forth with Diane
Sawyer,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   His waiting room is full of ecstatic former four-eyes. ``Every
decade has its thing,'' said Wayne Kessler, 25, after emerging from
the much-advertised ``flying spot laser.'' ``The '70s was bell
bottoms. The new millennium is getting your eyes done.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dello Russo, the late '70s and the '80s were about cataract
surgery, and lots of it. ``He was a big cutter,'' says Stephanie
Waterman, his marketing director and wife. But reimbursement rates
fell, and when doctors began correcting vision with lasers in the
early '90s, Dello Russo's office was an early test site. Like other
independent ophthalmologists, he now charges up to $5,500 for both
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   With new technology simplifying surgery and lowering risk, and
the country flush with disposable income, you can hardly turn on a
radio or open a newspaper without encountering a laser surgeon. It
might be Dello Russo, or Dr. Eric Mandel, talking about his laser
work at Harvard, or Bernie Williams touting Dr. Ken Moadel.
</P>
<P>
   It makes some ophthalmologists cringe. You don't hear it from,
say, plastic surgeons. ``Nobody says, `I do the perfect noses,' or
`I went to Dr. Miller and he gave me the cutest nose and the most
perfect nostrils,''' said Paul Orloff, a past president of the New
York State Ophthalmological Society.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, there is friction among laser luminaries. Dello Russo
said he started advertising so heavily because he was irked by
Mandel's ads about his role in laser research. ``Despite him, the
laser was developed,'' Dello Russo said. Mandel, who did have a
fellowship at Harvard, said Dello Russo's ``claim to fame is he
bought the first laser.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors are trying to polish their credentials before the
business is swallowed by clinics that zap eyes for as little as
$999 each. ``Everyone's looking for a piece of the laser market,''
Dello Russo said. ``You need a hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Moadel got his by operating on Bernie Williams between his
fabulous 1999 season and his more fabulous current season. Williams
now endorses Moadel in advertisements, for which Moadel says he
pays a ``token amount'' that is ``less than a day's pay'' for
Williams. The center fielder makes $12.5 million a year for 162
games, so a day's pay is real money, even for a laser surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Every doctor has his big-name patients. ``We do a lot of
doctors,'' Mandel said. ``I did an obstetrician yesterday. I did a
cardiologist last week. I did a Knick last week.'' Soon, Kurt
Thomas is on the phone, reporting: ``I can read license plates! I
can see people's facial expressions!''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees general manager, Brian Cashman, praises the surgery,
which he said Dello Russo performed free in exchange for using
Cashman's name to promote his practice. Neer, the DJ, said that he
also got free surgery from Dello Russo, in exchange for reading an
ad on air, and that several relatives followed him as paying
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dello Russo says his advertising campaign, which his wife
estimates costs ``several million'' dollars a year, is intended to
emphasize his experience. He has a new office in New York and will
soon open a bigger one in Bergenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it all end? ``I'm intensely goal-oriented,'' Dello
Russo said. He's setting things up for his three sons _ two are in
medical training and one is considering it.
</P>
<P>
   So, with all due respect to Mandel and Moadel, we're looking at
Dello Russos for as far as the eye can see. Which these days seems
like forever.

ON 14TH STREET, LESS GRIT, MORE GLAMOUR
</HEADLINE>
  By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city where the names of some neighborhoods
bestow cachet and some addresses are dropped like royal titles,
14th Street in Manhattan has probably never achieved even a minor
peerage.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind, says Gary Gaines, an importer who is about to trade
in an apartment off Sutton Place for a loft in the Greenwich, a
cavernous former department store at 14th Street and Avenue of the
Americas. He has bought 2,150 square feet of finished but
unpartitioned space on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines' neighbors at the Greenwich will include other migrants
from uptown, among them Brian Brooks, who sold his apartment at the
venerable Beresford on Central Park West, and Joel Solomon, who
lives on the Upper East Side at 80th Street and Third Avenue.
Solomon bought a loft for his 25-year-old son, Stephen, and a
penthouse for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will miss the seclusion and seeing Bobby Short in my
elevator,'' Gaines said, ``but I like living in the new, being part
of something happening. Fourteenth Street is on the threshold of a
major transformation, and this building is at its center.''
</P>
<P>
   People already living on or near 14th Street would probably say
that it has already crossed that threshold, starting with the
city's $3.6 million reconstruction of Union Square Park in 1983 and
the 1987 opening of the Zeckendorf Towers, a 652-apartment
condominium and office complex.
</P>
<P>
   But subsequent and future projects give weight to Gaines' notion
that another threshold has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of change are noticeable from the western end of the
street at least as far east as First Avenue, where Stuyvesant Town
dominates the landscape. (Even there, new fencing and ornamental
gate posts are planned, and new trees are to be planted.)
</P>
<P>
   These changes are giving 14th Street a new persona as a
residential boulevard, a booming retail thoroughfare and a mecca
for high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   At the western side, near 10th Avenue, art galleries, trendy
restaurants, late-night clubs and one of the city's highest-fashion
emporiums are bringing elegance and verve to the gritty
meat-packing district.
</P>
<P>
   From Eighth to Fifth avenues, new technology and dot.com
companies are clamoring for space, joining the publishers,
photographers, graphic designers and advertising agencies already
encamped there. An eyesore was removed recently when the long-empty
14th Street Armory was torn down earlier this year to make way for
two new apartment towers and a YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   On the east side of the street, further improvements are planned
for Union Square Park. The city has earmarked $2.5 million to
expand the park by 20,000 square feet at its southwest corner
between 14th and 15th streets.
</P>
<P>
   East of the park, New York University is expanding its domain,
constructing a 16-story dormitory on the site of the old Palladium
nightclub. The new building is two doors away from a 19-story NYU
dorm completed two years ago. The university has also signed a
lease for a 14-story building being put up by Alex Forkosh, a
developer, on the site of former Sahara Hotel, once a notorious
single-room-occupancy hotel and drug haven at 14th Street and Third
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   David Gmach, the executive director of both the 14th
Street-Union Square Business Improvement District and the 14th
Street-Union Square Local Development Corp., considers the
conversion of the Sahara and the demolition of the 14th Street
Armory, both of which were symptomatic of decay, to be hallmarks of
the changes that have swept across the entire street.
</P>
<P>
   Where the armory stood between Avenue of the Americas and
Seventh Avenue, two residential towers will be developed by Orda
Management Corp. and Related Companies. One will contain 60 luxury
condominiums for NYU faculty members; the other will be a rental
with 225 units, 20 percent of which will be reserved for low-income
tenants. The McBurney YMCA will occupy two floors at the base of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if you could find another single street
with that much going on in a two-to-three-year period,'' Gmach said
during a recent walk from 10th Avenue to Avenue B. ``There is at
least 1 million square feet of development that has either been
recently completed or is under way.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as any artery in the city, 14th Street, which is the
dividing line between Chelsea and Greenwich Village and also
borders the Flatiron district and the Ladies Mile Historic
District, has flourished and withered and then flourished again.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, it was the cultural and political epicenter of
the city: The Academy of Music, vaudeville theaters and Tammany
Hall were all thriving. Before the rise of Fifth Avenue as a
commercial hub, 14th Street was a retail center, housing the early
quarters of Macy's, Tiffany's and Best &AMP; Co. When those stores
moved uptown, bargain emporiums like S. Klein and J.W. Mays set the
tone for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Then about 35 years ago, the area began to slide into
deterioration, its middle-class shops shuttered or replaced by
cut-rate stores with flashy merchandise displayed on the sidewalk.
Union Square became a magnet for drug dealers and derelicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mays went out, the recession came in, and so did the
junkies,'' said Alex Barbagianis, an owner of Ariston Florist,
which moved to 14th Street and Fifth Avenue nine years ago after 16
years in a location a block to the west. ``You could buy any kind
of dope here, and we had a tough time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then several significant changes took place, and a turnaround
seemed possible. The Union Square Greenmarket was established in
1976, the city refurbished the park, and Zeckendorf Towers opened
on the site of the former S. Klein store at Union Square East.
</P>
<P>
   As Chelsea became gentrified, lower Fifth Avenue acquired
national retailers and chic shops, and stores like Bed Bath &AMP;
Beyond and Barnes &AMP; Noble moved to the southern end of Avenue of
the Americas, it became all but inevitable that 14th Street would
be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``If Times Square is the crossroads of the world, then 14th
Street is the crossroads of New York, because it's where uptown and
downtown come together as a 24-hour community where people both
live and work,'' said Gmach, the BID executive. ``Everything New
Yorkers could want is at their fingertips. There is a blend of
activities and diversity here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that assessment is widely shared, many would also agree
that 14th Street is a work in progress, and more remains to be done
to elevate it to first-class status. Some developers of residential
property, for example, still insist on giving their buildings
addresses on 13th or 15th streets. Mosbacher Properties, the
developer of the Greenwich, for example, plans to put the entrance
on 13th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteenth Street is one of the last major crosstown streets
in the city to undergo improvement,'' said David Schore, the
president of Mark Holdings, which recently bought the building at
25 W. 14th Street. ``Fifty-Seventh Street was always great, and
42nd and 34th now have a lot of new retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were to measure, he said, ``Forty-Second Street is 90
percent done, 34th is 50 percent done, and 14th is 50 percent done.
There are still a lot of 99-cent and electronics stores, and those
will be squeezed out by higher rents and hopefully higher-rent
retailers. It will never be an upper Madison Avenue, but it could
be a healthy extension of lower Fifth Avenue with a lot of national
chains.''

BRIDGE STARS COMPETE FOR CROWN

 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Fla., Ill.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Two star-studded teams faced off Saturday in
the final of the Grand National Team Championship at the American
Contract Bridge League's Summer Nationals. The defending champions,
all from Florida, include Michael Seamon, Joseph Shay and three
world champions: Jeff Meckstroth, Eric Rodwell and Robert Levin.
Opposing them is a Californian squad that includes Lew Stansby,
Chip Martel and Peter Weichsel, all world champions; and Rose
Johnson Meltzer, Ron Smith and Kyle Larsen.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Californian players seemed headed for defeat in the
semifinal Friday night, trailing by 41 IMPs with 16 deals remaining
against a Philadelphia squad. But a 54-IMP stretch effort enabled
them to snatch a 13-IMP victory. In the other semifinal, the
Florida team won comfortably against a Chicago group by 63 IMPs.

<P>
   They came over on merchant ships, refugees with a few valises
apiece that contained all in the world they owned.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding from scratch _ they had, after all, lost their homes
and most of their closest kin _ they worked at low-paying jobs in
dingy dress factories, luncheonettes, dry-goods stores. For many,
it was too late for any grander aspirations. Their children would
redeem their shattered lives.
</P>
<P>
   Their children more than met their expectations. But all the
pride they asserted over half a century _ quietly, so as not to
provoke the Yiddish evil eye _ seemed to crystallize this week with
special poignancy when a daughter of Holocaust survivors, Hadassah
Freilich Lieberman, stood on a platform and heard her husband, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, introduced, however prematurely,
as the next vice president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the chills when I heard about it,'' said Sonia Erlich,
who lost all but one of her 34 relatives in the Holocaust and lives
in the dwindling survivor community in Riverdale, in New York City.
``The world should know what we lost, but there is something in us
that God did not forget us. We believed something good would come
out from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden national prominence of Mrs. Lieberman has brought
into focus a largely overlooked chapter of the Holocaust story: the
lives the survivors built for themselves and their children in
America. Roughly 140,000 of them came to the United States after
World War II. Many denied themselves even ordinary pleasures _ no
movies, no dinners out, no taxis _ so that their children could be
educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that life is gornischt, life is a feather,'' said Julia
Rosen, an Auschwitz survivor, using a Yiddish term for
``worthless.'' ``So I tried to educate my children so they should
know more than I do, because if I was an educated person I would
have run away, I would have gone to China or Italy or I would have
hid in the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Rosen worked as a bakery clerk; her
husband, Andrew, drafted blueprints. But they put their three
children through good colleges and those children are now a
pharmacist, a computer consultant and a yeshiva teacher. Like
Erlich and Hadassah Lieberman's mother, Ella Freilich, Rosen lives
in Riverdale, a leafy neighborhood where survivors and their
offspring help give the neighborhood a European accent and
gentility.
</P>
<P>
   At first the refugees here barely had the confidence to remind
the world what had been done to them, let alone to protest. For
years there were no rallies, and only the flimsiest of survivor
organizations existed.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly why Rabbi Irving Greenberg, a Riverdale resident
who is chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, saw in Mrs.
Lieberman's new stature what he called ``an incredible contrast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago the Jews were totally powerless,'' Greenberg
said. ``Here was the most total genocide, and they didn't have the
political clout to get the president to let Jews in. They didn't
have the clout to get the president to bomb the railroads.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivors had already felt that powerlessness in Europe,
where in countries like Poland, anti-Semitic acts were common and
it was difficult for Jews to go to high school, let alone college,
or to work for the government or enter professions.
</P>
<P>
   And so the survivors share a special gratitude to America, and
``are superpatriots as a rule,'' said William B. Helmreich, a
professor of sociology at the City University of New York and the
author of ``Against All Odds: Holocaust Survivors and the
Successful Lives They Made in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman's story has familiar echoes for many survivors.
She was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where her mother, an
Auschwitz survivor, and her father, a slave laborer for the Nazis,
settled after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came from hell,'' was all Mrs. Freilich wanted to say about
her wartime experience.
</P>
<P>
   The family came to the United States when Hadassah Lieberman was
3. Her father, Samuel Freilich, was trained as a lawyer and rabbi
in Czechoslovakia, but he did not speak English and he knew he did
not have time to resurrect his legal career. So he went to the
Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, looking for a rabbi's
position, and soon was in Gardner, Mass., a furniture manufacturing
center where Congregation Ohave Sholom was eager to have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an immensely disciplined man,'' said Ary Freilich, Mrs.
Lieberman's brother, who was born in Gardner. ``He sat down with
The New York Times and a German-English dictionary and started at
the top of the page and began teaching himself English.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't earn much money, but he put Hadassah through Stern
College and Boston University and Ary through Yeshiva University.
In Boston, Hadassah Freilich met her first husband, Gordon Tucker,
the former dean of the Jewish Theological Seminary, and now a rabbi
in White Plains, N.Y. After they divorced, she lived in Riverdale
with her son, Ethan, until she met Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very appreciative of what she has,'' said Mindy Weisel,
a Washington friend of Mrs. Lieberman. ``She has not been a
princess. She doesn't take anything for granted, and that is a
keynote of her being a survivor's daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors sometimes made a mission of bearing and raising
children, and Frances Kahn, another Riverdale resident, offers a
simple explanation. She managed to emigrate to the United States
just before the war in 1939, but left behind parents, two sisters
and a brother, whom she never saw again.
</P>
<P>
   She now has three children. ``The same amount that I lost,'' she
said, ``I tried to make up.''
</P>
<P>
   In many homes, the survivors and their children maintained a
tacit silence about the wartime experiences. ``My daughter didn't
want me to talk about Auschwitz,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ary Freilich, who runs a real estate company in Fort Lee,
N.J., said he had a different experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents did not speak of it often, but you don't need to
speak of it often for the words to have an impact,'' he said. ``The
absence of relatives, the pictures of small children who never made
it to be adults, were images that were present in our home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust survivor families always have a little bit of
sadness in them. There is an appreciation of the fragility of life
and of the fragility of society. There is an awareness that forces
can bring a society down. But by the same token there is an immense
appreciation of life that comes from people who always lived at the
very edge.''
</P>
<P>
   And the children never seem to forget what makes them
distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Weisel said that after Mrs. Lieberman watched her husband accept
Vice President Al Gore's invitation to become his running mate, she
received an e-mail message from Mrs. Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mindy,'' it said, ``I felt I stood there for all the lost
souls.''

CONSTRUCTION ON LONG ISLAND DELAYS TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By AL BAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH HILLS, N.Y. _ Normally, closing any Long Island road in
the middle of summer is a sure recipe for traffic jams and driver
frustration _ never mind shutting down part of the Long Island
Expressway both ways all weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, a day that opened more like a crisp fall day
than one in August, the demolition of a bridge over the expressway
in Nassau County did not have as withering an effect on motorists
as it might have. A bitter rain, gloomy skies and a dull chill had
doused the numbers of eastbound drivers headed for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   A wrecking crew began removing the 44-year-old concrete, steel
and stone bridge Friday night as a part of the state Department of
Transportation's plans to renovate and widen the expressway between
Medford, in Suffolk County, and Queens, in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Once a new overpass opened on July 30, it was possible to start
the dismantling of the old Shelter Rock Road bridge this weekend,
said Eileen W. Peters, a spokeswoman for the department. The work
is expected to be completed by Sunday, but J.D. Posillico,
president of the contracting company doing the work, said the
project was going so well that it might finish ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Posillico said that because of the way the old arch bridge was
built, with steel rods running through the concrete rather than
with concrete slabs resting on steel frames, the whole bridge had
to be torn down at once.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, Peters said, 16 more bridges will be
refurbished or replaced in Nassau County and three of the projects
will require expressway closings similar to the one this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the tight schedule meant this weekend's work could
not be put off, because any postponement would delay the entire
project. She said that with 200,000 cars using the affected part of
the expressway on weekdays, a decision was made to disrupt weekend
traffic only.
</P>
<P>
   Some travelers on the road Saturday said they were willing to
put up with the temporary traffic snarl if the improvements would
make things less congested in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Others were angered by the work, though many said traffic was
treacherous on any day on Long Island _ with or without
construction.

 TWO MORE NEW YORKERS ARE ILL WITH WEST NILE VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two more Staten Island residents, a 63-year-old woman
and a 64-year-old man, have been sickened by the West Nile virus,
bringing the number of human cases confirmed this year to three,
city health officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that for the first time a dead crow
infected with the virus had been found in the Bronx. The two pieces
of news prompted them to announce another round of extensive
pesticide spraying to kill mosquitoes that carry the virus.
</P>
<P>
   As with the first confirmed case in a human, in which a
78-year-old Staten Island man became ill in late July, officials
said these two people had received hospital treatment and were now
recovering at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to have a full recovery ahead of them,'' said Dr.
Neal Cohen, the city health commissioner, who joined Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani at a City Hall press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's outbreak, centered in Queens, killed seven people
and sickened 55 others. Hundreds more tested positive for infection
but had no symptoms. People with weakened immune systems, the
elderly, and very young children are most at risk from infection.
</P>
<P>
   This year the outbreak has been centered in Staten Island. ``It
is critical that all New Yorkers, particularly the elderly and
those who live on Staten Island, take precautions to reduce
exposure to mosquitoes,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the dead bird found in the Bronx provided fresh
evidence that mosquitoes carrying the virus pose a threat across
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island has already been sprayed twice since the first
evidence of the virus was discovered there in early July. On
Saturday, Giuliani said the entire island would be sprayed from
trucks Monday night into Tuesday morning and again by air Thursday
night into Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said that a broad swath of the central Bronx, in
a two-mile radius around where the dead crow was found, would be
sprayed from trucks starting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   All of the spraying will be conducted between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.
Health officials said the pesticide used would be Anvil, a
relatively nontoxic chemical that the city selected to fight the
disease this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The new human cases come amid broadening evidence of
disease-bearing mosquitoes in Westchester County and in New Jersey.
The Star Ledger in Newark, N.J., reported Saturday that health
officials planned to spray the Middlesex County borough of Carteret
_ the first widespread spraying in New Jersey this year _ from 7:30
p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday and again on Thursday, as dead crows bearing
the West Nile virus were identified there.
</P>
<P>
   And officials in Somers, N.Y., told The Associated Press on
Friday that a so-called sentinel chicken _ set out as a precaution
to track infected mosquitoes _ had been infected with the virus.
But they said the area where the chicken had been placed had been
sprayed with pesticide after the infection took place, and no more
spraying was planned.

<P>
   Cohen said Saturday that the broadest evidence of the disease
had been obtained from mosquito traps. He said the latest analysis,
of samples taken from July 25 to July 28, found 13 cases of
infection on Staten Island and one in Central Park. But he said the
city has no plans to spray a fresh dose over Central Park, since
the park was sprayed on Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Two species of mosquitoes, one that feeds at night and another
that feeds in the day, had been found to carry the virus. Cohen
said that the latest analyses had found the virus in a third
species that feeds from dusk to dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said that the two Staten Island residents who
most recently became sick had been infected by mosquitoes before
the island was sprayed on Aug. 4. Symptoms of the virus generally
do not become apparent until three to 15 days after the victim is
bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that in the three human cases, the virus had caused a
type of meningitis, a less life-threatening illness than the
encephalitis or inflammation of the brain that killed people last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's names have not been disclosed. The officials said
the 64-year-old woman became ill on Aug. 4 and was admitted to a
hospital on Aug. 6. The 63-year-old man became ill on July 31 and
was hospitalized on Aug. 5, they said.

REAL ESTATE: CROSSING THE BRIDGE AS A RESETTLER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As their lease drew to a close at 160-170 Varick St.
in Manhattan, executives of Colahan Saunders Corp., a commercial
printing company, knew they were going to have to move. Their
landlord, Trinity Church Real Estate, was converting its portfolio
of buildings from largely industrial uses to offices, at rents that
industrial tenants could not afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the handwriting on the wall,'' said Peter F. Burke,
executive vice president of the family-owned concern, which has
been in business for over 100 years. ``Trinity was changing its
flavor, and we didn't expect our lease to be renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   After searching the entire metropolitan area, Colahan Saunders
settled on the Long Island City section of Queens, buying a
building at 47-01 Van Dam St. a few blocks from Queens Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   With vacancy rates in Manhattan near record lows and rents
spiking upward, Long Island City, with its proximity to the heart
of the city, good transportation links and sharply lower rents, is
functioning as a destination for companies being squeezed out of
Manhattan and for those that need space to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The space squeeze in Manhattan is responsible for the blossoming
of the Jersey City waterfront on the west side of the Hudson River,
in New Jersey, as companies like Goldman Sachs Group and Chase
Manhattan Bank shift back-office jobs to the less costly buildings
there. But the Queens area on the eastern bank of the East River
has an advantage that the New Jersey location lacks: It is within
New York City. For some city residents that can be an important
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have bought a building in New Jersey for half as much
as this one, but we would have lost a lot of employees,'' said
Peter D. Colahan, the president of the printing company. Because
they stayed in the city, he said, only one of the company's 75
employees declined to make the shift from Manhattan. The fact that
so many employees remained helped to keep the operations of a
company that runs 24 hours a day running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island City has long been an industrial area that also
served as a basement for Manhattan, holding warehousing and
distribution centers for retailers like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and
Gimbels. But now, as office uses are taking the place of factories
and warehouses, it is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey A. Bernstein, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, a big
brokerage and real estate services company, said the situation in
Long Island City today is similar to that in Midtown South in
Manhattan two decades ago. ``I started in Midtown South 20 years
ago, taking industrial properties and repositioning them for
offices,'' Bernstein said. ``The same dynamic is at work in Long
island City today, and service companies are coming out of
Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is marketing to office tenants a building at 34-09
Queens Boulevard that was once a factory making Breyer's ice cream.
The asking annual rent in the renovated building is $25 a square
foot, about half of what comparable space would cost in Manhattan.
Another nearby building, at 32-02 Queens Boulevard, formerly a home
to garment manufacturers, is similarly being offered to office
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the saving in real estate costs, he said, the East River
remains a barrier to many Manhattan firms, albeit only a
psychological one, since the area is just a few minutes away from
midtown by subway or the Queensboro Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   To help overcome that barrier and to avoid getting lost on
Queens streets, Bernstein said, he typically arranges for clients
to meet him at Grand Central Terminal and take the subway. ``We can
be at the buildings within seven minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage that Long Island City has over downtown Brooklyn
as a location for office development is that it can serve as an
adjunct of midtown rather of downtown Manhattan, said James
Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners, a tenant's broker. He
noted that midtown Manhattan has roughly 250 million square feet of
office space compared with 100 million square feet downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The development of downtown Brooklyn's Metrotech complex was
largely driven by Wall Street companies in downtown Manhattan
shifting back-office jobs to the Brooklyn location, which is also
only a few minutes away by subway. Meiskin said that Long Island
City could become Midtown East, in much the same way Midtown South
was transformed earlier.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Long Island City's prospects for development have looked
brighter in the past, only to be dimmed by a sharp decline in the
Manhattan market. The company then known as Citicorp completed a
50-story, million-square-foot tower there in 1989, but it stands
alone today in an area of low-rise loft buildings because the
recession that followed the stock-market collapse of 1987 made
space available at low rents in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One project that was hit hard by the competition from Manhattan
was the proposed International Design Center in two renovated
factory buildings on Thompson Avenue. It was to have been a center
for design companies that could not afford Manhattan rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the buildings became available, the concept never
really took off,'' said Michael A. Barak, who represents a group
that recently acquired the property. Renaming it the Queens
Corporate Atrium Center, the new managers recently rented 300,000
square feet of space to MCI Worldcom, a telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that calls about available space were now coming from
companies that do business with MCI Worldcom and from city
agencies, such as the Department of Transportation and School
Construction Authority, that are also situated there.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of using low rents to lure tenants out of
Manhattan is behind other projects in the area. A group led by
Marvin Schnee of Schnee Realty Co. in Cedarhurst recently bought a
nine-story, 95,000-square-foot building at 42-15 Crescent St. at
the foot of the Queensboro Street bridge. The group is renovating
the lobby, but the main attraction is to be annual rents in the low
$20s per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking to get people from Manhattan who are paying $45
to $50 a square foot who like the sound of $25 a square foot,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers say that the conversion of industrial buildings to
office use may be a good thing for the landlords involved but that
it is a threat to the warehouse and mechanical companies that have
cherished their proximity to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 2 million square feet of industrial space has been
converted to offices recently, and industrial rents have doubled in
the last 18 months, according to Franklin Zuckerbrot, executive
vice president of Sholom &AMP; Zuckerbrot Realty, a brokerage company.
``Companies that were paying $4 and $5 a foot are now facing $9 to
$12 a foot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent landlord in the area, Irwin Cohen, the chief
executive of ATC Management, said that new companies do not
necessarily have to drive out industrial tenants. The trick is to
combine new skills, such as computer-aided design, with the light
manufacturing already in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose properties include a 10-story, million-square-foot
building at 30-00 47th Avenue known as the Factory, said that one
of his tenants is a jewelry manufacturer that is planning to bring
out a new line of merchandise to be sold directly over the
Internet, rather than through retailers or television.
</P>
<P>
   He said software producers could make agreements with the
jewelry company not only to help in designing the new merchandise,
but also to help develop the Internet marketing system and Web
sites. ``They are going to sell directly from the factory to the
customer, so their prices can be lower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is the center of jewelry manufacturing in the
United States, he said, and developments like this one can help
keep it that way. He said the rising rents in Manhattan, where he
operates the Chelsea Market complex, will help promote these types
of alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Long Island City,'' he said, ``you can do manufacturing and
e-commerce at the same place.''

NFL NOTES: THEISMANN; GIANTS; BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theismann Still Has Arm Strength
</P>
<P>
   Joe Theismann, the ESPN analyst and former Washington Redskins
quarterback, has been friends with Baltimore coach Brian Billick
for years. So when Theismann made an appearance at training camp
last week, Billick thought he would break up the monotony by
allowing the 50-year-old to toss a few passes to Ravens receivers,
who were being covered by the secondary while running pass routes.
</P>
<P>
   Theismann's first throw was a bullet across the middle, only
several inches too high. The zip on the ball was so strong, the
Ravens players, almost in unison, shouted, ``Oooohhhhh!''
</P>
<P>
   Theismann was not done. His second throw was a perfect, tight
spiral on a deep out pattern that was caught and led to several
veterans joking that the backups had better watch out for their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite still having a strong arm, Theismann is not about to
come out of retirement. There was a time, though, when people
wished the Ravens starter Tony Banks would try another sport. But
after a dismal stint in St. Louis, Banks is entrenched as the
starter in Baltimore, and so far the move to trade for him after
the 1998 season has proven to be a brilliant one. Banks is making
better reads and decisions and this is the most comfortable he has
ever been in an offense.
</P>
<P>
   During a scrimmage earlier in camp against a good Ravens
defense, Banks completed his first 13 passes, including a 17-yard
touchdown pass to Jermaine Lewis. Over all, including last week's
preseason game against Philadelphia, he has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped Banks that he is in the first settled situation of
his NFL career. As a professional, he has never been in the same
offensive system for two straight seasons remarkable considering
this is his fifth season. And Billick's system is extremely
quarterback friendly. Last season, Banks started the final 10
games, and finished 6-4, including a 4-0 record in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has showed that he can run our offense efficiently,''
Billick said. ``I've said all along that Tony can step to another
level if he stayed in the same offensive system for two years in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants Considering Two Trades
</P>
<P>
   Are the New York Giants, usually conservative when it comes to
making trades, thinking about making two?
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the Giants pulling off one trade by the end of
the preseason are not as slim as one might believe, and neither is
the possibility of a second deal.
</P>
<P>
   First, several general managers have said, the team is
considering trading wide receiver Brian Alford, a third-round pick
in 1997. The Giants are deep at his position and Alford, though he
has shown flashes of talent at times in training camp this year,
will likely get little playing time during the season. That makes
him expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Those same general managers said the Giants, short on
cornerbacks, are considering trading for Jerry Azumah, currently
the third corner on the Chicago Bears' roster. The Bears may not
cut Azumah, and the Giants think they might be able to steal him
for a low-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have patience with players,'' said Giants general
manager Ernie Accorsi of Alford. ``This player has had no chance to
play. We have not given up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi had no comment on Azumah, and would only say Giants
scouts are looking at a number of players.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Outperforming Arrington
</P>
<P>
   The regular season has not started yet, but it is looking more
and more like the Cleveland Browns made the right decision in
picking the defensive lineman Courtney Brown with the No. 1 overall
pick in April's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Browns officials say at times he has looked like the best player
on the field. The athleticism scouts and coaches saw when he was at
Penn State is showing on the professional level.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the team debated between choosing Brown or his
college teammate LaVar Arrington, now with the Redskins. There is
no question Arrington is going to be a good player as well. But
Brown so far has a slight edge, mainly because he has been nothing
but a true professional, while Arrington irritated coaches and
players when in June he turned a one-day excused absence from
minicamp into a four-day unexcused absence. &QL;

he always figured. But now one of a fast growing number of North
Carolina farmers growing grapes to supply area vineyards,
57-year-old Hopson has learned to pay attention to sunshine and
other considerations critical to growing sweet, firm grapes. The
payoff? A crop that agricultural experts say won't replace North
Carolina's embattled, nearly billion-dollar-a-year crop, but one
that is acre for acre as profitable as tobacco. (Burritt, Atlanta

the election took place in China is a sign to some - especially
those at the Carter Center, who are working with China on

   PHONES _ ATLANTA _ Local telephone service, the rather boring
plain jane element in communications compared to go-go cell phones
and red-hot long distance services, has suddenly become a new
battleground. Many players are emerging to take on BellSouth, none
more eager than the cable giant, MediaOne, backed by its tentative
parent, AT&AMP;T. Yes, AT&AMP;T, old Ma Bell who used to be everybody's
phone company. The move by the cable company into phones, oddly
enough, is being helped along by BellSouth, mostly in obedience to
federal legislation. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

Tequila's in the downtown area, chatting with the owner, David

decided I needed the change more than the soda. As I pulled out of

series of political defections, can cobble together a functioning

in October and makes a final decision on its preliminary vote to
call early elections. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED Thursday.

 &HT;    Government gets into home building business
 &HT;    By Linda Rawls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Big Government has become Big House Builder.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the federal government has taken over
construction of a spectacular mansion on Lake Boca Raton _ a house
commissioned by a local man who prosecutors say bilked consumers of
an estimated $200 million in one of the country's biggest swindles.
</P>
<P>
   The government intends to sell the 19,000-square-foot house when
it's completed to help compensate the victims of Equinox
International, a multilevel marketing company founded by former
Boca Raton resident Bill Gouldd. The house could sell for as much
as $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gouldd, 46, has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing,
but in April he settled out of court with the Federal Trade
Commission and eight states that sued him in U.S. District Court in
Las Vegas, where Equinox was headquartered. The civil suit, which
accused Gouldd of running an illegal pyramid scheme, asked the
court to shut down his business, whose main product was water
filters, and seize his assets.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which put Equinox out of business and
confiscated Gouldd assets valued at up to $50 million, ended the
lawsuit _ and Gouldd's dream of lavish living on Lake Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also put the government in the unlikely business
of building a home and trying to sell it for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this is a unique property, it is not a unique
situation,'' said Robb Evans of Sun Valley, Calif., the
court-appointed receiver who is liquidating Gouldd's assets,
including a private jet, a yacht and a car with a gold-plated
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We typically analyze what we expect to receive by selling the
property 'as is' and what we would expect to receive if we do
certain work,'' Evans said. ``If the value added is sufficiently
greater, and if funds and time are available, we often have
undertaken substantial renovations or completion of work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gouldd case, Evans determined he could get a lot more
money for the house on 150 feet of prime lakefront if he finished
it before finding a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Time and money were no problem. ``This is not a fire sale,''
said custom builder Bill Szymanski, owner of Wm. L Construction,
whom Gouldd hired to build the home in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The original house on the site, near the Boca Raton Resort &AMP;
Club, made news a month earlier when Gouldd donated it to the
Harbour Branch Oceanographic Institute. The 10,000-square-foot
house was cut into four sections and floated by barge 80 miles up
the Intracoastal Waterway to Harbour Branch, where it was
reassembled to house a library and a multimedia department.
</P>
<P>
   The receiver hasn't set an asking price yet on the house going
up in its place, but Szymanski says $16 million to $18 million is
``in the right neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It likely will set a Boca Raton record.
</P>
<P>
   Szymanski estimates the house will cost $8 million to build. So
if it sells for its estimated minimum listing price, the government
will get $8 million for its victim compensation fund, minus real
estate fees and commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The house is full of amenities buyers in this bracket expect _
and some they might not. Besides two guest houses and an expansive
poolside entertainment area, the house has a private theater with
sofa seating and a popcorn stand, expensive Jerusalem marble
throughout and a mirror above the master bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This house obviously was set up to entertain,'' Szymanski
said. ``That was a large part of his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining and showing off his flashy homes and possessions
were part of Gouldd's strategy to lure people into believing they,
too, could easily make that kind of money through Equinox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would do recruitment videos from his Colorado ranch sitting
on his snowmobile or in his Lamborghini, as if to say, 'Look at the
success I have,' '' said Tracey Brierly, Nevada's deputy attorney
general. ``That was used to draw people in.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a draw required an extraordinary house, which this is, and
so is the man who envisioned it.
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators say Bill Gouldd was a con artist, but his
supporters _ and he still has them _ see a man of vision who went
from sleeping in his car to driving Rolls-Royces. Gouldd added an
extra ``d'' to his last name when a numerologist told him his life
was unbalanced. He would later say the ``d'' stood for ``dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his supporters believe Gouldd could make others rich if
they would just ``follow the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that plan that got Gouldd into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the eight states that sued him _ Florida was not
part of the lawsuit _ said Equinox International was an illegal
pyramid scheme. The settlement agreement bars Gouldd for life from
participating in the kind of operation he ran. It's called
multilevel marketing in its legitimate form _ companies such as
Amway or Mary Kay Cosmetics _ and a pyramid scheme in its illegal
guise.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators and prosecutors say Equinox distributors were
duped into thinking they could make good livings by selling water
filters and health-related products out of their garages. Like all
pyramid schemes, only a very few people at the top made money.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else lost, prosecutors say, and some lost lots of
money. Others lost much more _ relationships, homes, life savings,
college trust funds, retirement nest eggs, even their sanity,
prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to this: Do people make the money by recruiting
other people into the system, or from retail sales to the public?''
said FTC lawyer Frank Gorman, who helped prosecute the civil case
against Gouldd. ``The money has to come from sales to people who
aren't members of the scheme. Otherwise, it will collapse and
people at the bottom can't make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman estimates Florida consumers lost $16.2 million in the
scam.
</P>
<P>
   Gouldd now lives in Delray Beach and has an unlisted telephone
number. He declined to be interviewed for this story through one of
his lawyers, Rob Cary of Williams &AMP; Connolly, the Washington, D.C.,
firm that represented President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gouldd denied any wrongdoing in a statement he issued
through the law firm on the day of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed, and continue to believe that Equinox's
method of distributing products is a legitimate and unique way for
people with limited capital and means to run their own business on
their own terms.''

   BEL AIR, Md. _ Every minor leaguer has a major league dream.
This is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner's plane, en route from Tampa, Fla., to New
York, is forced to land at the tiny Harford County airport near
here. Impatient, feeling baseball-deprived, the Boss dials the
radio until he lands at the tiny community station, WHFC-FM 91.1.
He is mesmerized by the local game he hears, the quickness, depth,
savvy, desire, the power to use the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   He growls at an assistant, ``Who is that guy and why isn't he at
Yankee Stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   That guy, the dreamer, is Neal Conan, the 50-year-old rookie
play-by-play announcer of the Aberdeen Arsenal, a first-year
expansion club in the independent Atlantic League. Like Conan, the
players are not kids, most of them struggling to be rediscovered
after being cut from major league farm teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Conan, who gets to dream out loud, has had 23 years in the
major leagues, as an executive producer, a host, a prize-winning
foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, from which he is
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, while preparing for a live broadcast from the
Democratic convention in Chicago, his attention was caught by the
Cubs' broadcasters on his hotel television. He thought: That isn't
so different, I can do it. He began taping play-by-plays in front
of a silent TV screen. For the past three seasons, he moonlighted
as the part-time second voice of the Bowie Baysox.
</P>
<P>
   And on the night of Aug. 5, he was climbing the metal ladder to
the roof of the tiny press box at the tiny home field of the local
community college. An old friend, me, handed up his cables, mikes,
headset, Comrex Hotline, Shure mixer, Sony DAT recorder, all of
which, he explained, will ``squirt the broadcast signal down a
telephone line from the ballpark to the radio station'' and back
out to an unknown number of listeners, including Conan.
</P>
<P>
   He broadcasts with the backfeed echoing in his ears; it is the
only way he can be sure he is really on the air. Because his cell
phone is a different area code from the station's, he is not sure
that someone there will call long distance if there is a problem.
If indeed there is someone there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this,'' I said, minutes before the game, ``seems like a
midlife crisis to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said Conan, cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   He paced the press box roof, waiting to begin his pre-game show
with a taped interview. He had melted Maleke Fowler's reserve by
dubbing the 25-year-old outfielder ``the discourager'' for having
hit a leadoff home run in the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discourager,'' I sneered. ``Talk about ingratiating
yourself with a subject. Did you call Saddam Hussein `the heavy
hitter?' Some Bosnian jackal `the cleanup man?'''
</P>
<P>
   Conan, who was captured and held for a week by the Iraqis while
covering the Iran-Iraq war nine years ago, smiled serenely through
a graying red beard. ``It's true, I never said, `What a great
ambush.' Reportorial detachment is good, but it's nice to finally
be for something. I want these guys to win, to do well. I got
rushes covering wars and political conventions and the impeachment
hearings, but this is all by myself, filling three hours on the
radio, feeling really alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Conan screamed into his phone: ``Why aren't we on the
air? It's Neal. Pick up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the first Lehigh Valley Black Diamond was at
the plate that the connection was made and Conan was alive again.
It was easy to imagine his clear, dryly friendly voice in a larger
market. His delivery is crisp, seamless and authoritative, if a
little forgiving; he tends to excuse overrun pop flies as lost in
the late-evening shadows. But there is no false enthusiasm and no
irony. He has also learned that it is one thing to inform listeners
that the 26-year-old pitcher Zac Stark read Updike and Hesse on the
last bus trip, another to extol someone's wife and kids back home
when that someone is dating locally.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``family entertainment'' as much as it is organized
baseball. Independent league teams, with no responsibility to
develop players, can concentrate on winning games and profitably
building a community audience. Seats are $12 and $8 (children under
5 and in Little League uniforms are free). Cal Ripken Jr., who was
raised in nearby Aberdeen, is part owner of the club and is
building a fancy ballpark with a baseball academy attached.
</P>
<P>
   Conan is thinking bigger, too; commentaries on his minor league
life are broadcast every other Friday on NPR's ``Morning Edition''
and will fuel a book, entitled ``Play by Play.'' That might get
Steinbrenner's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still the bushes and far from home. His two
college-age children and wife, Liane Hansen, an NPR anchor, live
outside Washington, too far to commute. She says he looks 10 years
younger, and he says he is happy, but he has had twinges as the
political season heated up. Was he doing the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' Conan said, ``a fan asked me to sign his glove.
That never happened at a convention.''

 &HT;    Gore victory essential to invigorate Florida Democratic party
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A party in steady decline for nearly a decade,
Florida Democrats come to Los Angeles today determined to hold on
to what little power they have left.
</P>
<P>
   November is crucial to the party's future. A victory by Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and losses in the U.S. Senate race and other
key Florida races could doom the party to political obscurity in
the Sunshine State for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a party in serious trouble,'' says University of
Florida political scientist Richard Scher who specializes in
Florida politics. ``They have lost touch with white, male,
middle-class businessmen and professionals who now listen to the
GOP, which gives them a moderate-to-conservative message. Democrats
are struggling with their message, and until they have something to
offer that group they will continue to struggle as a party.''
</P>
<P>
   No decade was worse for Florida Democrats than the 1990s. After
more than a century of nearly unchallenged rule, Democrats fell
apart. By 1998, they had lost control of the state House and
Senate, a majority of the congressional delegation, scores of local
offices, and in a final crushing blow, they lost the governor's
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   They managed to hang on to the governor's mansion from 1990 to
1998, but that was because of the charisma of Lawton Chiles. Some
political leaders, however, partly blame Chiles for the demise of
the Democratic Party. Chiles came from a long tradition of elected
officials who considered the party machine a useless operation
unnecessary to their own political victories.
</P>
<P>
   What Chiles and other Democratic leaders at the time failed to
notice was that Florida's Republican leadership was spending
millions to build a strong party headquarters filled with political
professionals. They also rallied around someone with star power _
Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Lawton Chiles was in office, it was like he fiddled
while the Democratic Party burned,'' says Scher, who is not alone
in that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with the unrelenting reality that Democrats will
remain in the minority for the foreseeable future, party leaders
are counting heavily on winning this year's U.S. Senate race.
Democrats are banking on Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson who,
according to recent polls, leads Republican challenger, U.S. Rep.
Bill McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders also have high hopes for winning at least two
Republican congressional seats. One is the Orlando area seat that
McCollum is leaving, and the other is held by Republican E. Clay
Shaw of Fort Lauderdale. Shaw is getting a serious challenge in
District 22 from Democratic state Rep. Elaine Bloom of Miami Beach.
This district reaches from Miami Beach to Juno Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in very good shape for this election,'' says
Bob Poe, the new chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. ``Two
years ago, after the 1998 election, people were telling us to turn
out the lights and bring down the flag. I think a lot has changed
since then. For us to be even competitive in these races is
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most hopeful projections show Democrats picking up only
a handful of seats in the state House, where Republicans hold a
75-45 majority. Things are bit more hopeful for Democrats in the
Senate, where the GOP leads 23-15. Democrats hope to pick up three
or four seats there. That won't give them a majority, but it will
give them a stronger voice in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fervently want Vice President Al Gore to win Florida.
That would be a humiliating defeat for Jeb Bush and would dent the
sense of invulnerability that the Florida GOP has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this mystique about Jeb Bush and the Republican Party
that makes them even more formidable then they already are,'' said
a GOP political adviser to Bush who did not want to be named.
``That element of inevitability can really help when you're trying
to raise money or organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Poe acknowledges that if George W. Bush wins the White House,
``Jeb Bush will really be unstoppable'' when he comes up for
reelection in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also worry that in 2002, when the legislature is
required to draw new district lines for all House, Senate and
congressional seats, they will be forced to sit back and watch as
the GOP carves up the state in ways most beneficial to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats need to start rebuilding the party from the county
level up,'' says Scher. ``It's going to take a very long time. It's
something I think they are just now starting to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the party also suffers from not having a strong
statewide leader. U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, the party's top elected
official, like Chiles, has never been deeply involved in helping
the state party. Attorney General Bob Butterworth, popular with
South Florida Democrats, has done a better job, but he will leave
office when his term ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Nelson wins, he is not expected to work especially hard
to rebuild the state party. ``I don't see Nelson as a great
champion of the party. He never has been in the past,'' said a
senior Democratic Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Two years from now, when Bush faces reelection, Democrats will
be looking at a farm team of potential candidates. Political
strategists say the best Democrats can hope for in 2002 is to groom
someone to run four years later when Bush will have to leave
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that it has taken us a
while to understand that we are a minority party,'' says Poe. ``But
we do understand that now, and we're building the party back up. I
think in November you'll see that we are making significant
progress.''

ELKS _ THE CLUBS _ ARE BECOMING EXTINCT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a building in central Queens that is a
temple to the working man. It is a fading neoclassical castle of
brick and plaster. It is five stories high and one floor down, and
the American flag that flies above it is the only American flag
that can be seen clearly on Queens Boulevard for a mile in either
direction.
</P>
<P>
   It is Lodge No. 878 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks. To be a member you must be a U.S. citizen and a man over the
age of 21 who believes in God. The cornerstone was laid in 1923 and
the place was built for $750,000, an astronomical amount at the
time. There is a hollow bronze elk on a pedestal in front of the
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The place is dying from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has those old municipal smells, like those in the
public library or the marriage-license bureau. There is no sign of
life. A ringing telephone goes unanswered. There is a sign near the
stairs prohibiting women and non-Elks from climbing farther. On the
mezzanine is a sturdy oak door, where an Indian woman answers the
knock. She is a secretary for the New Life Fellowship Church. ``God
willing, we will own this place soon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the week, the Elks Club comes to life. A big
screen carries a simulcast from the Belmont Park racetrack, and a
dozen men hang around the first-floor bar waiting for their horses
to come in. Most of them are the older crowd: white, retired
teamsters, construction workers and such. They say things like
``It's been a while since I been in this jurnt'' and ``Lemme get a
sodie pop'' and ``Don't be a wise guy, Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   As at most men's clubs across the United States, the sun is
setting on Lodge 878. The building is for sale, because the club
can't pay the $60,000 tax bill. The New Life Fellowship Church,
which has been renting the mezzanine for four years, plans to buy
the lodge by the end of December for around $10 million. One of the
sticking points in the deal is that the Elks would like to keep
control of the first floor _ rent-free _ for 99 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world's changed,'' said Patrick Pendergrass, 66, the
treasurer of the club and the man who phones the bets to the
Off-Track Betting office. ``Clubs like this are folding all over
the place. It's a piece of America that's dying. We'd like to stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, everybody who was somebody and everybody who wanted to be
somebody belonged to the club. There were congressmen, district
attorneys, local political bosses. The club once had 6,600 members
(now there are about 600). If you wanted a job in 1960s Queens, you
came to the Elks.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Elks Bazaar, the borough's social event of the
year. There was the raffle of two dozen Cadillacs. There were the
eight bowling alleys _ with automatic pin setters _ in the
basement. There were the three bars. There were the drinks and
dancing and deals made under the stained-glass skylight. There was
the charitable work.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are Fridays and the 20 run-down men who board in the
rooms on the top floor. They wear robes and spend the day watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you're likely to hear at the bar on a Friday
afternoon: Maybe things are better for the working man, maybe
they're not; it's just that they don't seem better. The wife has to
work now, no more coming home for your dinner and then off to the
club. The neighborhood has changed. The houses are overflowing with
Third World immigrants. The club is dying. They say the economy is
better. They say the Wall Street money is finally trickling down,
that wages are trickling up. But so is inflation. So are taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my America anymore,'' said Charlie Novak, 58, a
construction worker and a veteran. ``The American kids aren't
interested in community anymore. And then again the community is
Third World.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics agree with Novak. Fraternal organizations are
drying up all around the country. Since the end of the Vietnam War
the Elks' national membership has dropped more than 15 percent,
despite the club being opened to women five years ago. The Shriners
have shrunk from a million members to half a million since 1980.
It's a similar story for the Knights of Columbus, Moose and Masons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Locally, according to the city's Department of Planning, the
population in Elmhurst, where Lodge 878 is located, grew by 16
percent between 1980 and 1990. Public assistance increased by 91
percent between 1990 and 1995. While the number of people living
there has increased, the white population was 20 percent of the
total in 1990, down from 36 percent 10 years earlier. At the same
time, Asians have increased to 37 percent of the population, up
from 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing is,'' said Pendergrass, ``we keep afloat by
catering to the Third World clientele. We do a lot of birthday
parties and weddings here.''
</P>
<P>
   The older guys who live upstairs wander the halls behind clouds
of cigarette smoke, staring blankly, appearing somewhat confused at
this new crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're from another era,'' said Eddie DeJesus Jr., the
administrator of the church. ``It's odd isn't it? A church and a
fraternal men's organization below. It's so New York. Jesus said
love everybody.''

 &HT;    WORLD WATCHING LIEBERMAN CANDIDACY, HIS RABBI SAYS
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The vice-presidential candidacy of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman will have the world's rapt attention, Lieberman's rabbi
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test case,'' Rabbi Barry Freundel of Kesher Israel
synagogue in Georgetown said in his Sabbath sermon to Lieberman and
other members of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the first Orthodox Jew to run for such a high office
in the United States, was accompanied at the service by his family
and yarmulke-wearing Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Congregants serenaded the senator with a song of celebration in
Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Hadassah, and daughter, Hana, looking on from the
section of the synagogue reserved for women, Lieberman stood in a
place of honor as the Torah was read. He chanted the traditional
Hebrew blessings before and after the Torah reading.
</P>
<P>
   David Sloan, a director of the synagogue who led a portion of
the service, bestowed a blessing on Lieberman and provoked peals of
laughter when he unexpectedly blessed Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue welcomed journalists inside but admonished them
not to take notes in the sanctuary or interview worshipers during
the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   When the morning service ended just after noon, two hours after
the Liebermans arrived, they returned on foot to their home in
Georgetown, trailed by a security detail.

 &HT;    HISPANICS BACK END TO PLAYBOY FLAP
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hispanic officials uniformly welcomed the
successful bid to get Rep. Loretta Sanchez to move a fund-raiser
from the Playboy Mansion, Democratic leaders said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came amid a flurry of moves to project an image of
party unity on the eve of the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amid concern among officials of Vice President Al Gore's
campaign that President Clinton's five-day pre-convention schedule
here threatened to overshadow the Democratic nominee's message,
Clinton canceled a round of televised interviews Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The president instead played golf with Mayor Richard Riordan of
Los Angeles and Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic convention
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   _ Democratic general chairman Ed Rendell said that despite a
dispute over Gore's free-trade policies, labor unions would use
their political might on his behalf this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although union people disagree with us on trade, they are with
us on a whole boatload of (other) vital issues,'' Rendell said at a
breakfast with reporters. ``So they are going to go all out for
Gore in November.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Family members of former Gov. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who
died this year, will address the convention following the personal
intervention of Gore, Democratic national chairman Joe Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Casey, a Democrat, was denied a convention role because
his position against abortion differed sharply from that adopted in
the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, who also appeared at the breakfast, praised Sanchez and
said she remained a valued member of the party hierarchy despite
her previous insistence on holding the $3 million Hispanic Unity
USA fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about location, location, location,'' Andrew said.
Key California party figures, including several influential
Hispanics, had been tryinto get Sanchez to forgo that sexually
suggestive location, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   In return for backing down, Sanchez retained her speaking slot
before the delegates, her largely honorary title as a party
co-chair, and the continued political support of Gore, who feared
the Playboy-hosted event would detract from his plans to stress
moral family values at the convention and in the coming campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing late Friday to make the shift, Sanchez praised Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante of California, who she said was instrumental
in finding an alternative site ``with the cachet we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, the controversy threatened to dim the political
fortunes of Sanchez, who was the second-highest party fund-raiser
last year _ trailing only Gore, according to Federal Election
Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 people had already donated $5,000 each to attend the
Tuesday night event for the political action group, which Sanchez
has led for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, they will now show up at B.B. King's Blues Club at
Universal Studios' CityWalk _ even though King himself is a
Republican who backs Gore's rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Camacho, a Los Angeles businessman and Democratic
fund-raiser who runs two restaurants at CityWalk, said he helped
arrange use of King's club after being approached by other Latino
figures who were eager to settle the burgeoning controversy.

Los Angeles, a sprawling concatenation of communities with a
restless multi-ethnic character, there is no single ``face,'' in
the usual sense of the word. A surge of immigration and the rapid
shift toward an economy dominated by small businesses rather than
huge corporations have pushed Los Angeles into a dizzyingly complex
transition. (Keith Meyers/The New York Times)

of the city's host committee. Woo will soon become the first

he has helped guide groups involved in everything from voter

row house disaster in 1985. The gleaming brick replacement houses
for the 60 innocent homeowners on Osage Avenue and Pine Street
whose houses were destroyed when police dropped explosives on the
MOVE quarters, turned out to have been built with construction
flaws by a corrupt developer. (Richard Perry/The New York Times)

Angeles, the host city for the Democratic National Convention. In
Los Angeles, a sprawling concatenation of communities with a
restless multi-ethnic character, there is no single ``face,'' in
the usual sense of the word. A surge of immigration and the rapid
shift toward an economy dominated by small businesses rather than
huge corporations have pushed Los Angeles into a dizzyingly complex
transition. (Keith Meyers/The New York Times)

Charlie Woo is the sort of business and civic leader one would
expect to find at the head of the welcoming line at the Democratic
National Convention, and, in fact, he will be, as a vice chairman
of the city's host committee. Woo will soon become the first
Asian-American chairman of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and
he has helped guide groups involved in everything from voter
registration to inner-city job development and Chinese-American
political fund-raising. (Keith Meyers/The New York Times)

 CHINA DETAINS BOSTON POET AND PUBLISHER
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS GRILLO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   A Boston-based poet and publisher of a literary journal has been
detained by police in Beijing and copies of his magazine have been
seized, according to friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bei Ling, editor of Tendency Quarterly, a journal of Chinese and
Western literature, has not been seen since Friday night, when two
uniformed police officers and one plainclothes officer seized
several hundred copies of the journal from a bar near Beijing
University, his friends in Beijing said. Bei disappeared after a
forum to review the latest issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is shocking news,'' said Shirley Chang, a friend who is
staying at Bei's home while she teaches a summer course at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston. ``I spoke to him by
telephone 10 days ago, and he didn't mention any problems. I don't
understand why this happened all of a sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   But Merle Goldman, a Boston University professor who specializes
in Chinese intellectual history and dissent, said she is not
surprised by the police action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government is cracking down on anyone who
questions the Communist Party,'' she said. ``While the journal is
not political, some of the material can be interpreted as such
because it does not follow the party line of a positive view of the
People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the arrest has to do with the current policies of
the regime, she said. While Tendency has been published in China 13
times since 1993, Goldman said, China's political climate today is
more repressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, they have allowed the journal to be
distributed, but now there's a sense of vulnerability in the
government, and they are cracking down on the Internet and
arresting people who, they say, are spreading anti-party
messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said she believes that the Chinese government will
eventually release Bei but could bar him from entering the country
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can keep Bei Ling out of China, but they cannot keep the
journal from coming in from other sources. The government can't
stop the Internet and Western ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei was being held in Beijing's university district, according
to a friend who did not want to be identified for fear of
attracting police attention. Police did not provide a reason for
the detention, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have previously told Bei that Tendency has ``political
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe in 1994, Bei said, ``Tendency is
meant to call more attention and respect to culture and humanism,
advocates for freedom of expression, and individual creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei, 40, moved to the United States in 1988. He is a Chinese
citizen and has a US green card.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1994, Bei was questioned for three hours in Shanghai.
A few days later in Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong, police
questioned him for three days, including a nine-hour interrogation
session, about ``The Post-Communist Nightmare,'' an essay by Vaclav
Havel that was included in the first issue of Tendency. Havel is
the former dissident and playwright who became the Czech Republic's
first democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the executive editor and cofounder of Tendency said
interference by Chinese officials will not halt the publication of
the magazine. ``No matter what happens in terms of the oppression,
we look foward to someday publishing the journal openly in China
and working toward freedom of expression,'' Meng Lang said through
a translator.

   BEL AIR, Md. _ Every minor leaguer has a major league dream.
This is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner's plane, en route from Tampa, Fla., to New
York, is forced to land at the tiny Harford County airport near
here. Impatient, feeling baseball-deprived, the Boss dials the
radio until he lands at the tiny community station, WHFC-FM 91.1.
He is mesmerized by the local game he hears, the quickness, depth,
savvy, desire, the power to use the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   He growls at an assistant, ``Who is that guy and why isn't he at
Yankee Stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   That guy, the dreamer, is Neal Conan, the 50-year-old rookie
play-by-play announcer of the Aberdeen Arsenal, a first-year
expansion club in the independent Atlantic League. Like Conan, the
players are not kids, most of them struggling to be rediscovered
after being cut from major league farm teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Conan, who gets to dream out loud, has had 23 years in the
major leagues, as an executive producer, a host, a prize-winning
foreign correspondent for National Public Radio, from which he is
on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, while preparing for a live broadcast from the
Democratic convention in Chicago, his attention was caught by the
Cubs' broadcasters on his hotel television. He thought: That isn't
so different, I can do it. He began taping play-by-plays in front
of a silent TV screen. For the past three seasons, he moonlighted
as the part-time second voice of the Bowie Baysox.
</P>
<P>
   And on the night of Aug. 5, he was climbing the metal ladder to
the roof of the tiny press box at the tiny home field of the local
community college. An old friend, me, handed up his cables, mikes,
headset, Comrex Hotline, Shure mixer, Sony DAT recorder, all of
which, he explained, will ``squirt the broadcast signal down a
telephone line from the ballpark to the radio station'' and back
out to an unknown number of listeners, including Conan.
</P>
<P>
   He broadcasts with the backfeed echoing in his ears; it is the
only way he can be sure he is really on the air. Because his cell
phone is a different area code from the station's, he is not sure
that someone there will call long distance if there is a problem.
If indeed there is someone there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this,'' I said, minutes before the game, ``seems like a
midlife crisis to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep,'' said Conan, cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   He paced the press box roof, waiting to begin his pre-game show
with a taped interview. He had melted Maleke Fowler's reserve by
dubbing the 25-year-old outfielder ``the discourager'' for having
hit a leadoff home run in the last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discourager,'' I sneered. ``Talk about ingratiating
yourself with a subject. Did you call Saddam Hussein `the heavy
hitter?' Some Bosnian jackal `the cleanup man?'''
</P>
<P>
   Conan, who was captured and held for a week by the Iraqis while
covering the Iran-Iraq war nine years ago, smiled serenely through
a graying red beard. ``It's true, I never said, `What a great
ambush.' Reportorial detachment is good, but it's nice to finally
be for something. I want these guys to win, to do well. I got
rushes covering wars and political conventions and the impeachment
hearings, but this is all by myself, filling three hours on the
radio, feeling really alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Conan screamed into his phone: ``Why aren't we on the
air? It's Neal. Pick up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the first Lehigh Valley Black Diamond was at
the plate that the connection was made and Conan was alive again.
It was easy to imagine his clear, dryly friendly voice in a larger
market. His delivery is crisp, seamless and authoritative, if a
little forgiving; he tends to excuse overrun pop flies as lost in
the late-evening shadows. But there is no false enthusiasm and no
irony. He has also learned that it is one thing to inform listeners
that the 26-year-old pitcher Zac Stark read Updike and Hesse on the
last bus trip, another to extol someone's wife and kids back home
when that someone is dating locally.
</P>
<P>
   This is ``family entertainment'' as much as it is organized
baseball. Independent league teams, with no responsibility to
develop players, can concentrate on winning games and profitably
building a community audience. Seats are $12 and $8 (children under
5 and in Little League uniforms are free). Cal Ripken Jr., who was
raised in nearby Aberdeen, is part owner of the club and is
building a fancy ballpark with a baseball academy attached.
</P>
<P>
   Conan is thinking bigger, too; commentaries on his minor league
life are broadcast every other Friday on NPR's ``Morning Edition''
and will fuel a book, entitled ``Play by Play.'' That might get
Steinbrenner's attention.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still the bushes and far from home. His two
college-age children and wife, Liane Hansen, an NPR anchor, live
outside Washington, too far to commute. She says he looks 10 years
younger, and he says he is happy, but he has had twinges as the
political season heated up. Was he doing the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``But then,'' Conan said, ``a fan asked me to sign his glove.
That never happened at a convention.''

 &HT;    Fires threaten precious artifacts

   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK - Two months before a pair of wildfires
ravaged Mesa Verde National Park, archeologist Linda Towle sat in
the living room of her house in the park packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was packing as I was watching the film from Los Alamos
(N.M.,) and I said, 'That's it,''' recalled Towle, 52, chief of
research and resource management at Mesa Verde. ``I boxed up all of
my photos, slides and family papers and I rented a storage unit in
Cortez.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Towle remembers the day: Thursday, July 20. The time was a
quarter of two. She had just settled down in an administrative
meeting to close out the year-end budget when she heard the news
that she had been dreading all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendant's secretary came in and said, ``Just want
you to know there's a fire. ... It's probably not a big deal,'''
said Towle.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something different about this fire. It was
behaving erratically, burning late into the night instead of
resting. Fire conditions were prime _ dry oak brush, pinon and
juniper trees baked in the scorching afternoon sun _ and the
brilliant blue Colorado sky provided no hint of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Towle heard the fire management officer get on the radio and
call for an evacuation of the park.
</P>
<P>
   She made the mad dash home, grabbed what she could and raced
over to the office to account for her employees, some of whom were
still out in the backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Towle found herself holed up at the Comfort Inn in
Cortez with her cat, Kiva, a stray she befriended eight years ago
after the six-week old kitten had been abandoned inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the Bircher fire, which scorched more
than 23,000 acres inside one of the nation's largest archeological
preserves, Towle found herself in evacuation mode again. This time
a lightning strike on the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation near the
tiny town of Towaoc started another fire. It was making a run for
the opposite side of the park, sweeping up steep rugged canyons
filled with bone dry vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pony fire charred more than 5,200 acres before it was
contained Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire crews were brought in from as far away as Alaska to battle
the blaze. Aggressive air attacks obliterated the remote terrain
almost daily with water and slurry, a reddish-colored substance
made up of chemicals to douse the fire. On the ground, firefighters
carved out fire lines by hand as archeologists worked ahead of them
scouting out potential sites.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2,000 new archeological sites have been discovered
as a result of the fires, but so far no major sites have been
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   For Towle, who struggles daily with the thought that she may not
have a home to go back to, the worst may be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   PRICELESS ARTIFACTS AT RISK
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the Research Center, a tin building the size
of an airplane hangar. It houses a priceless collection of 2
million Native American artifacts, including some dating back as
far as 400 A.D., that has been threatened by wildfire three times
in the past four years. Each time, the fire has crept to within a
mile of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, irreplaceable artifacts are housed in
gun-metal gray cabinets with tracking numbers posted on each door.
Shelf after shelf provides a glimpse into the past: Navajo
basketry, ceramics and silver work; Ute moccasins; beaded Zuni
steer heads; prehistoric pottery, yucca blankets and sandal
remnants; and pot rests, brooms, farming implements and photographs
from the Gustaf Nordenskiold collection.
</P>
<P>
   There are even human remains waiting to be reburied under the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts are the only records left detailing the history
and habits of the Ancestral Puebloans, a lost civilization that
vanished more than 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the fires, special precautions were taken to protect the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks circled the perimeter of the tin building like wagon
trains from the days of the Old West.
</P>
<P>
   The windows and vents were covered with reflective fire
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were instructed to save the building at any cost _
even if that meant using bulldozers to build a fire line, which is
against park policy unless buildings are threatened. Bulldozers
were parked and ready to go if the fire raged up lower Chapin Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a safety zone adjacent to the Research Center
where structural fire trucks could safely stay and hose down the
center and foam it as the fire is passing over,'' said Towle.
``That would be the plan, but human safety is the highest
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   A heat-sensitive fire suppression system inside the building was
deactivated to prevent flooding.
</P>
<P>
   There is no room for error.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan had gone awry, windows could have shattered from the
intense heat, allowing the flames to creep inside. Or the roof
could have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fire does not get inside the building, we might have
some water damage from the roof leaking as it is being foamed and
sprinkled,'' said Towle. ``If something happens and the building
were to collapse, then a lot of the (artifacts) would be damaged
and getting them out of there would be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The location of the Research Center is kept secret as a security
precaution. In May, The Daily Sentinel was allowed inside for a
rare opportunity to photograph the artifacts with the stipulation
that the location of the building not be published. But with the
intense media spotlight on the fires at Mesa Verde, the warehouse
and its contents have been widely publicized on national networks
like CNN and ABC, as well as various other print publications.
</P>
<P>
   LOOTING AFTER THE FIRES
</P>
<P>
   Once the threat of fire has passed, park officials could find
themselves dealing with another headache: artifact looters.
</P>
<P>
   Earl K. Shumway is the poster child for artifact looters.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described outlaw from Moab, Utah, is serving a 6-year
federal prison term for pilfering artifacts in southeastern Utah.
It's the longest sentence ever given for an archaeological resource
violation.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesa Verde, there is only one backcountry ranger to patrol
for pot hunters, vandals and poachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the burn, it is easy to see footprints leading off and we
will follow up on anything we see,'' said Towle. ``After the Chapin
5 fire (in 1996), we had no evidence that people were trying to get
into the burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The scuttlebutt around town is that it's easier to slip into
unauthorized areas of the Ute Mountain Tribal Park because of the
lack of security, but wildlife officers regularly patrol the area.
</P>
<P>
   The park has an estimated 25,000 archeological sites, many
pristine and untouched. Only 850 sites have been documented due to
a lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to the tribal park, a weathered, white sign
reads, ``Stop: You are entering Ute Mountain Tribal Park. All
non-tribal members must be accompanied by a tribal park tour
guide.''
</P>
<P>
   A drive on the gravel road inside the park turns up no obvious
signs of security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some problems three years ago at the mouth of Mancos
Canyon,'' said Veronica Cuthair, director of the Ute Mountain
Tribal Park. ``There were some illegal excavations happening, but
they never caught them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases are hard to prosecute due to a lack of witnesses. Once dug
up, artifacts are hard to link to a looted site. Professional
looters are sophisticated, carefully planning their illegal
excavations, studying archival and library materials and
topographical maps, according to Robert D. Hicks of Law Enforcement
Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid detection, looters use lookouts, watchdogs and radio
scanners to track law enforcement. Others have been known to carry
false identification and forged permits. Some have even been caught
red-handed wearing fake park ranger uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Violation of the Archeological Resources Protection Act can
result in fines of up to $100,000 and five years in prison or both.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal artifacts that make their way to the black market bring
in big bucks _ upwards of a million dollars if the piece is rare
and in excellent shape. Many artifacts end up overseas where it is
a multi-million dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   A search on e-Bay, an Internet auction site, found 225 listings
for Indian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Most items were arrowheads, pottery sherds, knives and bone
tools. A Michigan barbed axe was fetching $1,450 and the bidding
hadn't yet closed.
</P>
<P>
   Towle isn't worried about the artifact looters.
</P>
<P>
   She's more concerned about the fire danger and the long, hot
summer that still looms ahead. As the saying goes, ``Lightning
never strikes the same place twice,'' but could it strike three
times in a row?
</P>
<P>
   For now, all Towle can do is wait.

JOHN'S CALL ROMPS IN SWORD DANCER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ They bought him eight years ago for
$4,000 in the hopes that he would be an athletic steeplechase
horse. They thought his name was Stuart's Affair. By the time he
became a 2-year-old, however, Thomas Voss discovered two things.
First, the colt could not jump. Second, he had the wrong horse.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the big chestnut was really named John's Call.
Somewhere between South Carolina and the trainer's base in Maryland
the wrong horse got on the wrong truck. But John's Call was on the
right track here Saturday and splashed home a 9\-length winner in
the rain-softened bog at Saratoga in the Grade I Sword Dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could run on broken glass,'' Voss crowed. ``He may be 9
years old but he doesn't think he's nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a gelding, John's Call, probably had. He was the oldest
horse in the field by three years. With 31 races, he was the most
seasoned. His steeplechase experience? Well, he's tried it as late
as last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When does a 9-year-old gelding who was supposed to be a jumper
win a Grade I race at a 1 { mile?'' asked Douglas Joyce, one of the
owners in Trillium Stable, which collected $300,000 for the
first-place check, before answering his own question. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   But under Jean-Luc Samyn, John's Call laid in the back of the
pack around the first, second and third turns before pulling even
in the stretch with Aly's Alley, who had set a leisurely pace in an
attempt to steal the tour of the swampy marathon race from the
front end. ``I wasn't surprised to be on the lead. He was the speed
of the race,'' said Aly's Alley rider Robbie Davis, who held on for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   But Samyn had charted his trip around the spongy footing in
order to finish well. He stayed on the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the rail was the place to be, and I wouldn't have moved
off it for anything,'' he said. ``Once daylight opened up, he just
took off and exploded. It was a superb race for a 9-year-old to
run. The thing I loved about it was that he was happy to do it. He
knew he had won. He was happy galloping back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the field dwindled to eight when the connections of
two millionaires _ Val's Prince and Honor Glide and three other
horses _ scratched their horses instead of taking on the tricky
footing, the old gelding was sent off as the fifth choice and
rewarded his believers with a generous $16.80 payoff for a $2 bet.
</P>
<P>
   One classy horse that stayed in the race experienced all kinds
of trouble on the soggy turf. Under Kent Desormeaux, the $1 million
earner Single Empire never got in gear and chased the top two
finishers home in third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big effort on ground on which he is probably not his
best,'' said trainer Neil Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   There was some valid reasons for the crowd of 24,787 to doubt
that the aging John's Call belonged at the top levels of turf
racing. Besides his steeplechase attempts, one of which he won
here, John's Call had run for as low as a $50,000 claiming price
and never had taken on such classy company. On the other hand, he
had won 13 times, placed 11 and came in third on two other
occasions which means he was near the wire in 28 of his 31 starts.
He also had an affinity for Saratoga _ winning twice and placing
second three times in seven attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Voss understood how confusing John's Call might have looked to
the public. He had often been confused himself about the old horse
he had. In 1992, the owners had bought two horses and sent them to
South Carolina to be broken. One was sent to Voss, the other to
another trainer. It wasn't until Stuart's Affair was about to race
that he noticed his identifying tattoo belonged to John's Call.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, however, they've been together. From jumps to flats.
From Delaware to Maryland to New York. From a chip in the ankle and
months on the farm, to a victorious 2:32:17 victorious gallop in a
$500,000 race. Seven years in all, one of them calling his charge
by the wrong name. So whatever happened to Stuart's Affair?
</P>
<P>
   ``He never ran a race in his life,'' Voss said. ``Isn't that
something?''

SETBACKS FORCED GORE TO BROADEN HIS FOCUS BEYOND ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day last September, Vice President Al Gore met
privately with President Clinton to deliver an urgent message.
Republicans on Capitol Hill, Gore said, were taking aim at the most
important weapon in the war against global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was livid.
</P>
<P>
   This was his issue, his passion, not to the mention the
centerpiece of his 1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance.'' To realize
his pledge to help decrease global warming, Gore was counting on
huge improvements in auto and truck gas mileage. But Republicans
had amended an important transportation bill to block even a study
of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Veto the bill, Gore urged Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Find the votes to sustain a veto, Clinton replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried _ and failed. Most Democrats told Gore they wouldn't
back him, and the president wasn't about to veto the bill just to
show solidarity with Gore. And so, the Clinton-Gore legacy on
global warming is something of an embarrassment: Greenhouse gases
have increased significantly, among other things. And the subject
has gone from being one of Gore's favorites to one that puts him on
the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   The global warming defeat doesn't exactly typify Gore's years at
Clinton's side. He has many accomplishments he can point to, more,
in fact, than most who have confronted the paradox of the vice
presidency: its exalted constitutional status, yet its scant
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The episode does underscore the evolution of Gore, in his vice
presidential years, from the idealist of ``Earth in the Balance''
to the ``Budget in Balance'' pragmatist who learned to promote
achievable goals that might pass a Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Gore's seven years and seven months as vice
president shows how he has been molded by the experience, and
suggests the president he might become.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has described Gore's tenure grandly, saying he is the
most influential vice president in history. The reality, as
described by many Gore associates, is not so simply summed up.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was frequently at war within the White House,
battling with young aides, and sometimes Clinton himself, until he
managed to install his own choice as White House chief of staff.
And failing to win the policy portfolio he wanted, Gore made do
with the one he was given _ leading the ``Reinventing Government''
effort to shrink the federal establishment _ a thankless job whose
benefits to taxpayers Gore seems prone to exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also likes to say that Gore was involved in every major
decision of his presidency. But this happened only after Gore
tempered his intellectual pride, found middle ground, listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore was not a good listener early on,'' said a close Gore
friend, Leon E. Panetta, the longtime California congressman who
served as White House budget director in 1993 and 1994 and then as
chief of staff from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to change his mind,'' Panetta said. ``I think he
learned from Clinton that no matter how deeply you feel about
something, you've got to speak to those who oppose you. Bill
Clinton is a damned good listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore eventually became a listener, too, but only after some
painful lessons and bruising defeats. It is an essential evolution
for any leader, Panetta said. ``Otherwise, you are an idealist
walking off a cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamed, perhaps, by the lessons of his vice presidency, Gore has
chosen to run for the White House as what he calls a ``practical
idealist,'' in the hope that the public wants a steady steward of
the thriving economy and not a politician whose briefcase is
bulging with idealism and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after Clinton and Gore won the election of November 1992,
Al Gore laid out his vision for their partnership. Meeting with the
president-elect, Gore opened with an extraordinary request. He
wanted to see every piece of paper that crossed Clinton's desk:
every briefing paper, memo, classified report. No vice president
had ever had such access, Gore believed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had publicly assured Gore a full partnership,
eventually agreed. He assigned John Podesta, then White House staff
secretary and now chief of staff, to put two boxes in Gore's
office, one each for classified and unclassified material. ``He saw
everything,'' Podesta said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore learned a hard lesson: Knowledge isn't always enough.
</P>
<P>
   He might have dreamed of being a virtual co-president, but the
reality was that the job was already filled _ by Hillary Clinton.
Her emphasis on universal health care, which ended in failure,
consumed much political oxygen in the White House, making it
difficult for Gore to win early attention for his favorite cause,
which was no less than saving the earth.
</P>
<P>
   While Hillary Clinton was taking the stage on health care, Gore
was suffering his first major defeat. He asked Clinton to assign
him the task of revamping the welfare system. To Gore, the project
was intellectually stimulating and would affect millions of
families. It would also help solidify his credentials as a moderate
``New Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rebuffed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wanted welfare reform for himself,'' a former
senior White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a recent interview with the Globe, was more
circumspect. ``I argued that we should do welfare reform on a fast
track and put health care reform on a four-year cycle instead of a
two-year cycle because I felt we had to build a constituency for
it. I'm not saying they made a wrong decision on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from gaining a leading role on a policy issue, Gore found
himself fighting a war inside the White House against much of the
senior staff. A cadre of young, liberal, and influential Clinton
aides, led by George Stephanopoulos, were often at odds with Gore,
finding him too moderate on issues ranging from the budget to
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all those fights, George was on one side, Gore was on the
other,'' said Bruce Reed, Clinton's domestic policy adviser, who
participated in many policy brawls.
</P>
<P>
   From Day One, Gore was concerned that he would be left out of
important policy discussions. So he attended countless meetings,
and plowed through those boxes of presidential paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be an adviser without portfolio on every issue''
that Clinton faced, Gore said. ``And that gave me the opportunity
to sit in on every private meeting that I wished to, to have his
complete confidence and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Gore would understand that he needed more. When
Clinton was looking for a new chief of staff in 1994, Gore saw an
opportunity to push for an ally to help take on the young Turks. So
the vice president called on his old friend Panetta.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked: Would Panetta be interested in becoming White House
chief of staff? Panetta agreed, taking over the office in June
1994. If there is a watershed date in Gore's vice presidency, that
might be it.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Gore had realized that he wasn't going to be able
to meet his environmental goals. That view was solidified by
Republican takeover of the House in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gore elected to adopt Panetta's top cause: Balance the
budget. Though few saw it that way at the time, the forging of the
Gore-Panetta partnership marked a turning point in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore became adamant that the administration could balance the
budget. The view was shared by few top officials, and among the
doubters was the president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much credit he deserved for the surplus, Gore, the
Internet maven, offered a joke: ``One hundred percent, of course. I
invented the surplus!''
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, he said: ``My role was behind the scenes. The
truth is, I worked as a team player to use my influence as I could,
which often meant quietly, which meant the internal consensus
toward the necessity of balancing the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta was thrilled that Gore had become a convert. To the
former California congressman, the vice president's lobbying of the
president was a perfect way to perform an end-run on the young
Turks who had been frustrating him for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when the president was questioning whether
deficit reduction was the right thing to do, whether he would pay a
huge price politically for doing it,'' Panetta said. ``The vice
president, at one point, said, `Look, this really is a moment where
you have to be bold in what you do with the budget. If you fail to
take this one on, ultimately you will never have the resources for
the initiatives that you care about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other associates say it is difficult to decide how much credit
Gore should be given for balancing the budget and reviving the
economy. For example, the former Treasury secretary, Robert E.
Rubin, asked whether Gore had steered the policy in a direction it
might not have gone otherwise, said the question had no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody in the world who could tell you why the
decision came out the way it did,'' Rubin said. ``I don't imagine
even the president could tell you. There is no way anybody could
ever know how much effect each person's input had on a decision.
What you can say is who was there, what role they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was very deeply involved,'' Rubin said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, in a surprise to most analysts and a boon to Gore,
the government is now running a huge surplus. Emboldened by that
success, Gore is running for president on a platform of eliminating
the publicly held debt of $3.5 trillion, a commitment that George
W. Bush has not tried to match.

   TAKE-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... to match.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1993, Clinton's first spring in the White House, and he
was mightily irked with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, he complained, was urging him to raise taxes
again _ specifically, an energy tax to help the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was sympathetic with the goal. Gore, after all, had
spent many of his weekly lunches with the president arguing that
global warming must be stopped. ``This is real,'' Gore would say,
and the president believed it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore became concerned about global warming as a student at
Harvard University, and he eventually held hearings on the issue as
a senator. By the time Clinton picked him as a running mate in
1992, it was Gore's signature issue. He proposed that by 2000,
global warming gases be cut to 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal, Gore called for a tax increase, variously
suggesting a 50-cent-per-gallon rise or a tax on energy sources
such as coal and gas. The idea was that a tax would reduce energy
use and thus decrease global warming. The money raised by the tax
might be spent partly on environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The idea split the White House. One group, led by
Stephanopoulos, was convinced that the measure would be hugely
unpopular with the auto-driving public and anyone else who depends
on energy. Clinton, while outwardly sympathetic to Gore, complained
about the proposal in private, according to his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the spring of 1993, Clinton would vent privately
that Gore was pushing him to raise taxes too much,'' Stephanopoulos
wrote in his White House memoir, ``All Too Human.'' (Stephanopoulos
declined to speak for the record about Gore; he said he stood by
his book.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Gore energy tax was replaced with a
4.3-cents-per-gallon gas levy that, with Gore's assent, was
initially used for deficit reduction. (Today, to the dismay of some
environmentalists, the gas-tax revenue goes for road-building.)
</P>
<P>
   And what of Gore's great cause, global warming? The level of
greenhouse gases is about 9 percent above 1990 levels, and
environmental activists worry that the administration has no
concrete plan to meet Gore's goal. It is clearly Gore's great
embarrassment as vice president: He went to Kyoto, Japan, in 1997
to persuade dozens of nations to agree to reduce global warming,
but he failed to meet his own goal at home.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now says he will make the coming 10 years the
``environmental decade.'' And he has proposed a $200 billion
program to tackle global warming. That will require a dramatic
reduction in emissions from cars and trucks, and from coal-fired
power plants. But Gore doesn't talk of new taxes anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now predicts he can meet his goal of reducing the gases to
1990 levels by 2008. But the fight could hurt him in the campaign.
His effort to increase auto mileage is unpopular in the vital state
of Michigan, and his pledge to crack down on coal-fired power
plants could hurt him in the many coal-producing states.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore said, if elected president, ``I will do this. If
folks don't want a president who is committed heart and soul to
moving heaven and earth to solve this problem, then they ought to
look somewhere else. But if that is what you want, that is what I
want to do _ and strengthen the economy at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a made-for-the-cameras scene. On the White House lawn,
forklift trucks were weighed down with tons of government
documents. Cue to the vice president, who appeared before the media
to announce to the president and the country that he would
eliminate needless regulations and cut the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, few knew that Gore had accepted this assignment
only after Clinton would not let him take on welfare reform. And
even fewer knew that some of Gore's closest advisers thought he had
exaggerated the potential savings of ``reinventing government,''
also known as REGO. (Some White House aides called it ``MEGO,'' for
``My Eyes Glaze Over.'')
</P>
<P>
   One White House faction, which included Stephanopoulos, worried
that Gore would use REGO to eliminate many government programs
prized by liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Another group doubted that Gore could come close to the promised
$130 billion in savings. Panetta privately put the estimate at $30
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had known each other for a long time and I said, `Look,
there is no way you can justify this,' '' Panetta recalled telling
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore won out with the higher estimate, which he now says was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Gore tell it, REGO has been a smashing success. He says
that the program has saved $136 billion. The government, Gore says,
is the smallest it has been in 40 years, with 377,000 fewer
employees than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But those savings owe more to the end of the Cold War than to
Gore's effort. Nearly 70 percent of the government's work-force
reduction is attributable to the post-Cold War shrinkage in
civilian employment at the Pentagon, according to a Brookings
Institution analysis. Perhaps half of the monetary savings are the
result of defense budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had a good cushion to start with,'' Panetta said of
the defense cuts. ``It is probably a mixed record.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott A. Hodge, director of tax and budget policy for Citizens
for a Sound Economy, a conservative-oriented group, said Gore's
claims for REGO results are misleading because federal spending has
gone up $390 billion, or 28 percent, since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, found in a 1999 report that two-thirds of the savings
claimed by Gore could not be verified, and that some of the savings
were double-counted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, REGO, now known as the National Partnership for
Reinventing Government, is housed in a fancy suite of offices a
block from the White House. The place is pure Gore, with high-tech
designer desks and chairs, aphorisms from Gandhi on the wall (``We
must be the change we want to see in the world'') and a conference
area that has been renamed the ``creativity room.'' There is only
one full-time employee, the director, Morley Winograd, with 40
workers on loan from various agencies, who focus on projects such
as making government customer-friendly. The emphasis is on putting
as much government activity as possible on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rejects the criticism of his REGO effort, saying that he
reduced the bureaucracy in many ways that otherwise would not have
been possible. ``We have a lot of success stories,'' Gore said.
``We have changed the culture, and I'm very excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, the Clinton administration was being criticized
for not stopping the carnage in Bosnia. Hundreds of Bosnians were
being killed, Sarajevo was under siege, and the administration's
strategy was being pummeled in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was among the critics, and he took his case to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with the president and national security aides,
Gore made his case in a way that would come to define Gore's
foreign policy role in the White House. He said that his daughter
had seen a picture of a woman hanging from a tree in Bosnia. Gore
said his daughter had asked him why the administration was not
doing something to help the Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asking myself the same question,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time during the Clinton administration that
aides remember Gore directly challenging the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a direct challenge to US policy and hence the
president's policy,'' said Ivo H. Daadler, who was director of
European Affairs at the National Security Council at the time. ``It
was the only time I remember hearing about Gore challenging the
president in the presence of others. That is not normally how he
operates. Normally, he would do it in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked about his dramatic statement, said: ``In many ways,
that was the same approach that I had on the balanced budget; I
just tried behind the scenes to nudge and noodge the consensus. I
think that it would be wrong for me to give you the impression that
my family was the only family represented at that meeting that was
heartsick about the moral consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Gore made his statement, it was becoming clear that
US policy would change. A White House official who participated in
the meeting said that Gore's comment had ``crystallized'' the view
that force would be used, but that the view had already been in
formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easier, and maybe at this time in the vice
president's interest, to say it was he who was behind the scenes
who motivated the president in periods of indecision,'' said a
White House official who attended national security meetings. ``But
that isn't the way I sensed it. I thought the entire group of us
was coming to an edge of a decision. I always felt that the vice
president at those moments was someone whose voice was being
listened to very carefully, because if he had raised doubts about
where we were heading, I think we might have headed someplace
else.''
</P>
<P>
   To Gore, it was important to show the world that the United
States was unafraid to use its power. Gore, after all, had been one
of only 10 Democratic senators to vote for using force in the Gulf
War, a crucial voice in that 52-47 vote in 1990. (Another was
Gore's running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut _ a
point noted by Gore last week in explaining his pick.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his outspokenness about Bosnia, Gore remained in
the background in the discussion three years later about whether to
use force in Kosovo, where Serbs were killing or expelling ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found no evidence of any role by Gore, positive or
negative, on Kosovo,'' said Daadler, who served as the director of
European affairs at the White House National Security Council from
1995 to 1996 and has written a book about the administration's
Kosovo policy called ``Winning Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the war began, Gore worked behind the scenes to try to
end it. On May 4, 1998, as US planes were bombing Kosovo, a visitor
came to Gore's residence on the grounds of the US Naval
Observatory. It was Victor I. Chernomyrdin, the former prime
minister of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Through Gore's vice presidency, Gore had maintained a close
relationship with Chernomyrdin, cochairing a commission on
US-Russian interests that was often used as the White House's back
channel to Boris N. Yeltsin, who resigned last year as Russian
president. The New York Times has reported that CIA officers sent a
warning to Gore that Chernomyrdin was allegedly involved with the
Russian Mafia. The message from the top-secret intelligence
document was clear: Keep your distance. Gore reportedly wrote a
one-word expletive across the CIA dossier.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, asked about this last month on NBC's ``Meet The Press,''
called the story ``utter nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never happened?'' asked the moderator, Tim Russert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never happened,'' Gore responded. ``You know, I don't think I
ever wrote a message of that kind on any CIA report.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's response was revealing _ and somewhat misleading. In the
Globe interview, Gore said he probably uttered the epithet to the
CIA briefer and said an aide may have written the word on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentiment ascribed to me was a fairly accurate description
of what I thought of that particular document,'' Gore said. Asked
whether he made the comment verbally, Gore said: ``Yeah, yeah, and
somebody may have written it on my behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it was telling that Gore believed he knew more
about Russia, and about Chernomyrdin, than the analysts at the
George Bush Center for Intelligence at CIA headquarters in Langley,
Va., which is named in honor of Governor Bush's father, the former
CIA director and president. Gore met Chernomyrdin twice on that May
day, sealing a tentative deal in which the president of Finland
agreed to act as intermediary to persuade the Serb leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Chernomyrdin dealings were pure Gore, a
behind-the-scenes move that played a role in ending the war. But he
is reluctant to take much credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vice president trying to garner credit behind the scenes is
not a game that has a clear winner,'' Gore said. ``I'll let others
describe the importance.''

 &HT;    THE DEMOCRATS' SURPRISING CONVENTION
 &HT;    By FRANK CERABINO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can cut the excitement with a knife here.
Wait, come to think of it, that's not the excitement, that's the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats picked a terrible time to come to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   It's so hot, Al Gore may just blurt out that he invented the air
conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived Saturday morning, and promptly checked in at the
Florida delegation's hotel _ which I believe is on the edge of
Runway 9 at Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for us, the convention isn't being held at baggage
claim. It's being held at the Staples Center, which is at least
four freeways and a $36 cab ride from the hotel. If the Florida
delegation were any farther from the convention center, they'd be
at the Reform Party convention in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   What a crazy election! The Republicans paraded around
Philadelphia as if they were the Wall Street chapter of the Sisters
of Mercy. And the Democrats pretend they're not interested in sex _
canceling that Tuesday fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion here.
</P>
<P>
   I'm deeply worried that the Democrats have forgotten how to
party. I find this troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Democrats have a fund-raiser that's listed as
B.Y.O.B., it probably means Bring Your Own Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have decided to go with a ``p'' theme this
convention. They've distilled their theme into three ``p'' words:
prosperity, progress, and peace.
</P>
<P>
   I can think of a few other ``p'' words that might have been in
the running. So I'm awarding honorable mentions to ``perjury'' and
``poontang.''
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking. You think I'm being nasty just
because they canceled that party at the Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for approximately 14,595 of the 15,000 media types
here, the fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion was going to require
the kind of blanket coverage usually reserved for moon landings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what are we going to do on Tuesday night?
</P>
<P>
   Bait Rep. Barney Frank into telling rude heterosexual jokes
about Dick Armey?
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the keynote speech from ... let's see, who's speaking
that night ... Harold E. Ford Jr.? Who is Harold E. Ford Jr.?
</P>
<P>
   He's supposedly some up-and-coming 30-year-old congressman from
Tennessee _ as if we need to hear from anybody else from Tennessee.
Al Gore's all the Tennessee I need.
</P>
<P>
   This convention needs more New Yorkers. People like ... Hillary.
She'll get to speak Monday night, just before her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Clintons will get out of town and allow the excitement
to build for Gore and his running mate, Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   If that's possible. I can't imagine how.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the media will continue to emphasize that Lieberman is
Jewish, and that makes his selection a ``bold move'' by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Not bold enough, I say.
</P>
<P>
   Here's bold: Instead of calling the convention America 2000,
call it America 5760.
</P>
<P>
   As you can tell, I'm not a political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a pundit, which allows me to make reckless and
sometimes wildly inaccurate predictions. So here are 10 predictions
for the upcoming week's festivities:
</P>
<P>
   1. During his speech Monday night, the Rev. Jesse Jackson will
not rhyme the word ``Gore'' with ``snore'' or ``bore.''
</P>
<P>
   2. AFL-CIO boss John Sweeney will take a five-minute break in
the middle of his speech, as called for by contract.
</P>
<P>
   3. Somebody will speak Spanish during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   4. If it's Al Gore, real Spanish-speaking people will laugh at
his accent.
</P>
<P>
   5. Not once this week will Sen. Ted Kennedy drink a shake for
breakfast and lunch, and then eat a sensible dinner.
</P>
<P>
   6. Michael Dukakis and Walter Mondale will have obstructed-view
seating in the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   7. President John F. Kennedy will be mentioned more than a dozen
times _ not counting the mentions in speeches given by his daughter
and brother.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nearly every speaker will find it necessary to use the phrase
``this great land of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   9. The convention orchestra will not play the ``Theme From Love
Story'' to announce Gore's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   10. The convention will be marred by pushing, shoving, and a
mini-riot ... when the food is served at the media party.
</P>

SO-SO RACE STILL GOOD COPY FOR PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media analyst Andrew Tyndall says the uninspiring 2000
presidential race should get the journalism it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're reporting on it accurately, they shouldn't report
it as a battle of ideas, because it's not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By any number of measures, from surveys of citizens to the TV
ratings for the GOP convention, voters seem distinctly unmoved, and
in some cases, woefully undereducated, about a race that Newsweek
says looks to be ``at first glance . . . a low-stakes affair
pitting the gregarious chairman of the Inter-Fraternity Council
against the earnest president of the Science Club.''
</P>
<P>
   One scenario between now and Election Day is a tactical war
between Al Gore and George W. Bush, which triggers ``horse-race''
journalism about polls and name-calling that further alienates the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a number of observers offer an optimistic counterview. They
suggest that if Gore emerges from Los Angeles having turned the
race into a tight one, as is expected, the media will have a
serious chance to play a pivotal role in a hotly contested
election, one in which journalists help reengage the electorate in
the final campaign stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, we have a greater opportunity to have an
issue-oriented campaign than we've had in many years,'' said Larry
McGill, Freedom Forum research director. ``This is a wonderful
opportunity for journalism to rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not now evidence to suggest that the 2000 campaign has
been journalism's shining hour. The media, and the candidates
themselves, have not captured public interest, and the reduced
network TV convention coverage is one symptom of a wider malaise.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, a Pew Research Center survey found that only a
quarter of the voters knew much about what the two major candidates
stood for. The aptly named Vanishing Voter Project at Harvard
University's Joan Shorenstein Center, which has tracked the high
level of voter apathy, found that only days before the Republican
convention, more than three-quarters of those surveyed didn't know
when it was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, some early surveys also tracked the media's
preference for strategy over substance. A Project for Excellence in
Journalism study in the runup to the early primaries found that 54
percent of the 430 stories examined had dealt with topics such as
fund-raising or tactics, more than twice the number of
policy-related articles. A survey of network news coverage in the
month before Super Tuesday, conducted by the Annenberg Public
Policy Center, found that at least two-thirds dealt with
``horse-race'' or ``strategy-oriented discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the very prospect of a real horse race between Gore and
Bush that leads some analysts to suggest that the media will turn
its focus not just to the dynamics of the race, but also to the
issues and positions that could swing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that it will be the most competitive presidential
race in a generation,'' said Paul Taylor, executive director of the
Alliance for Better Campaigns. ``Competitive races tend to spark
people's interest. And the fact that it's a close race increases
rather than decreases the chances'' for more substantive coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a close race, both the issue coverage and the
horse-race coverage will be more substantial,'' said Thomas
Patterson, Bradlee professor of government and the press at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``I think you'll get a lot
of polls because there'll be interest in the gain of even two or
three points. But that invites attention to what will be the
cutting-edge issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a race in which the Republicans acted like Democrats at their
convention and the Democratic nominee picked one of the most
conservative running mates he could find, some wonder what those
cutting-edge issues might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they are going to cover,'' Everette Dennis,
a professor of communications at Fordham University, said of the
press. ``In a way, Nader is right that there are profound
similarities'' between the candidates, Dennis added, referring to
the Green Party presidential candidate, Ralph Nader. Dennis
suggested that biography and blunder may dominate the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center director, Andrew Kohut, said: ``I think
the debates will make it interesting. I think they'll pick a fight
over something. My worst fear is that it will be like 1988,'' when
George Bush sparred with Michael S. Dukakis over largely symbolic
wedge issues like the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing opinion is that the story will revolve around
meatier matters. ``I think there are a number of very important
issues that have been placed on the table, to the credit of the
candidates, particularly Bush,'' Taylor said, referring to tax
policy and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the race has to be amazingly substantive''
on such subjects as Social Security and public education, added
Larry Sabato, a media critic and author of the new book ``Peep
Show: Media and Politics in an Age of Scandal.'' ``Bush has to
prove he has the policy skills . . . and Gore is convinced he's on
the popular side of the issues. He knows he doesn't have the
personality to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato also said the candidates have set a tone that will
dictate a more serious debate. ``This is the first race that I can
ever remember where both candidates have gone out of their way to
tell the press, the public, and their opponents that they will be
positive, positive, positive,'' he said. ``It also fits the mood of
the country. . . . People want a positive race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at these candidates and say they're the same,''
Kohut said. ``In this case, if we're going to engage people in the
story, it's going to have to be on the issues . . . what the stakes
are, why this is important to you, and the way the candidates are
different in consequential terms. Getting some meaningful
differentiation is crucial to getting people to connect with this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the whining about this year's no-news campaign, it
holds a lot more potential than the last presidential fight. In the
lopsided 1996 contest between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, coverage
was down, voters yawned, and journalists went through the motions
for the final few months. Newsweek's postmortem carried the
headline ``Bored to the Bone,'' and four years ago, the Freedom
Forum's McGill said the media's role in the 1996 race was
``signaling to voters this wasn't a campaign worth watching. It's
like continually announcing there's a 10-run lead in the seventh
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there's not likely to be a 10-run lead. And
the candidates as well as the media may have a crack at a
late-inning comeback.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Truth be told, the convention hall looked a bit
dingy. The paint was faded, the floors were scuffed. There were
only two bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the delegates didn't seem to mind. By city bus and by
beat-up car, many with young children in tow, they had come to
downtown Los Angeles Saturday to set the Democrats straight: The
Democratic Party is not just the party of extravagant nightly
parties, they said. It is the party of poor people, too.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arballo, a 40-year-old mother of six children, two of
them grown, said: ``I hope they can hear us. I hope they know we're
here.''
</P>
<P>
   With 250 or so others, Arballo was at the Mothers' Convention on
Welfare, a half-day event timed to coincide with festivities
surrounding the Democratic National Convention, which opens Monday.
While caterers prepared canapes for the galas that began Sataurday
night, mothers and other activists around the city began trying to
get their messages out.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between DNC-related activities and those organized
by coalitions concerned about everything from the environment to
immigration to union-busting can be stark, sometimes intentionally
so, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the welfare convention Saturday at Patriotic Hall,
for instance, said they had only enough funds to provide
participants with store-bought juice, coffee, and bagels, although
day care was available without charge. On Friday night, organizers
of the Homeless Convention, which expects as many as 200 delegates
to turn out for its sessions this week, served a supper of donated
rice, beans, and water at its party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the cheapest convention in town; we're playing with
pennies,'' said Katy Habir, executive director of Dome Village, a
downtown shelter running the event. ``Our only questions are: one
tent or two, chairs or no chairs?''
</P>
<P>
   Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based rights group, also saw a
chance to make a point. Sunday night, while a group of conservative
Democrats rents out the amusement park on the Santa Monica Pier for
a high-ticket fund-raiser, Global Exchange will host ``The People's
Party'' on the beach below.
</P>
<P>
   Union activists will be in the area after massing outside the
Loews luxury hotel, where they are engaged in a dispute, as will a
group that plans to rally outside The Gap on the Third Street
Promenade, to protest the sweatshop conditions under which the
company's clothing is allegedly produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real people will be in the shadow of their party sponsored
by corporations,'' said Juliette Beck of Global Exchange. ``We'll
be an ice cube's throw away.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the counterpoint events are being held as close to the
convention center as possible so that delegates might see them on
their way to to and from the Staples Center, now surrounded by
fencing and blocked off by police cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the First United Methodist Church downtown Saturday,
volunteers began erecting 5-foot-tall crosses in the parking lot,
553 in all, each bearing the name of someone who had died trying to
cross the Mexico-California border since 1994, when the government
initiated Operation Gatekeeper to keep out illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the installation drew the attention of dozens of
police, who dispersed after observers from the National Lawyers
Guild arrived and made clear that the group had permission to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping this is the kind of dramatic statement that will
make people walk by reverently and think'' about US immigration
policies, said David Hanks, an activist who was overseeing the
site.
</P>
<P>
   At St. James Episcopal Church, farther from downtown, they were
trying to win notice for children who had been fatally shot. Women
Against Gun Violence/Silent March displayed scores of pairs of
shoes that had belonged to young victims _ sneakers, dress shoes,
strappy gold sandals, and beaded thongs among them. Among those
present was LA's police chief, Bernard Parks, whose granddaughter
was recently shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ruett Foster, a lifelong Democrat whose 7-year-old son,
Evan, was killed in December 1997, ``I think deep down inside, in
the quiet moments, the Democrats will hear what we're saying. I
don't know what will come out of it. I just hope they get down to
work once the partying is done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday parties included a pricey and private farewell to
the Clintons, and any number of other invitation-only dinners. The
convention host committee was inviting the 15,000 journalists
covering the convention to an event costing more than $1 million.
And that was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   It was also only the start to the demonstrations and alternative
events, too. Hoping to show the other side of the city, the
Figueroa Corridor Coalition for Economic Justice was running two
bus tours through the neighborhoods. Global Exchange has tours of
its own, to a juvenile detention center and the garment district,
and to other locations off the typical delegate path.
</P>
<P>
   ``While delegates are being wined and dined downtown, we want to
bring attention to the problems of the poor and working people,''
said Amy Schur, organizer with the Los Angeles Association of
Community Organizations for Reform NOW, which rallied on Friday for
housing. ``Unfortunately, it's just a small percentage of delegates
and elected officials who want to see reality. It's not as high on
their agenda as the parties.''

BUCHANAN CLAIMS FACTION NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Winding up what he called ``the last
red-meat convention in America,'' Patrick J. Buchanan Saturday
accepted one of the Reform Party's disputed presidential
nominations with a fiery attack on the two major parties as well as
several international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But at a separate convention a block away, Buchanan's opponents
renewed their vow to block him from the Reform Party's place on the
November ballot, charging that the former Republican candidate had
stolen a mail-in ``primary'' by encouraging 500,000 GOP voters to
take part in the Reform Party process.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Buchanan faction formally nominated John Hagelin to be
its presidential nominee. Hagelin asked the group to accept Nat
Goldhaber, a California businessman, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Buchanan chose Ezola Foster, a black California
educator, as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and Hagelin are expected to continue their battle for
legitimacy this week before the Federal Election Commission in a
feud over $12.6 million in campaign funds due to the Reform Party.
The dispute will probably end up in federal court, both sides say.
</P>
<P>
   As the two factions completed their activities here, they ended
a week that appears destined to become a bizarre footnote in
American political history. The movement that Perot started in 1992
by winning 19 percent of the vote in the presidential election _ a
constituency that threatened the two-party system _ spun out of
control in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's party, which originally rallied under the banner
``United We Stand,'' lay in divided ruins Saturday after Buchanan
led his followers to the right while the remnants of Perot's group
cast their fortunes with Hagelin, a little-known physicist from
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Perot faction said they intended to rebuild the
party. ``I will be absolutely ruthless not to allow this party to
be pulled down into the hell of internal division ever again,''
said Jim Mangia, chairman of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Verney, a former national chairman of the Reform Party
and a close associate of Perot's, said the focus should now be on
building the party on the state level with local candidates rather
than attempting to compete in a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But after losing bids for the Republican presidential nomination
in 1992 and 1996, Buchanan seized the moment as a chance to lead a
party into a general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery Saturday night, Buchanan
assailed both the Republicans and Democrats for conspiring ``to
kill our beloved republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party will never reform education because it is
held hostage by the teachers' unions,'' he said. ``Republicans will
never shut down the IMF (International Monetary Fund) because if
they did, the corporate lobbyists would cut off their room, board,
tuition, beer, and gas money.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also promised to ``lead this country out of the WTO

CLINTON GETS A LATE PRESIDENTIAL LOOK AT LA'S GLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wistful and nostalgic, President Clinton is
playing to adoring audiences as he prepares for his sendoff at the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea, the president
arrived Friday in this city where he is not just a president, but
also a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   He has a schedule of glittery fund-raisers, gala tributes, and
glad-handing with Democratic groups, leading to his prime-time
convention address Monay, and his exit from center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Attention will shift to Al Gore after Clinton meets with him
Tuesday in Monroe, Mich., for a symbolic passing of the torch. In
the meantime, Clinton plans to make the most of his days in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At times this year, Clinton has expressed ambivalance about
leaving office, which he must do because of the constitutional
limit of two terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are in a period of transformation where the vice
president who wants to be president wants the president to do what
he wants to him to do,'' said Charles O. Jones, an emeritus
professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin.
``That's a role reversal made extremely difficult because the
president is still the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, White House and Gore aides played down reports
of tension over Clinton's functions this weekend. The president is
staying here nearly twice as long as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He is raising money, including at a star-studded concert
Saturday night to benefit Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign and at
a brunch Sunday at Barbra Streisand's house, which is expected to
raise millions for Clinton's presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about complaints that he was hogging the spotlight,
Clinton laughed. ``I've never heard him say that,'' he said of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Gore spokesman, Chris Lehane, said: ``He's the
president of the United States. By definition, he's always going to
be in the spotlight.'' But at this week's convention, Lehane said,
``The vice president will step out as the leader of the Democratic
Party, the standard bearer in this election.''

rights advocates demonstrated Saturday in Los Angeles where
delegates began arriving for this week's Democratic National
Convention. Thousands of protesters are expected to descend upon
the city in the upcoming days. A few dozen demonstrators carrying
poster-sized pictures of aborted fetuses protested outside the
Staples Center, where the convention begins Monday. Meanwhile,
protesters continued making banners, picket signs and satiric
puppets at their nearby headquarters, named the Convergence Center,
to be used this week. On Friday, a federal judge ruled that police
could only enter the headquarters if they have a search warrant or
during an emergency. The decision came in response to a complaint
by the American Civil Liberties Union's citing that the Convergence
Center has been a target of police harassment.
<P>
   GORE TAKES ON BIG BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Vice President Al Gore stood on a ridge overlooking
the Allegheny River in Springdale, Pa., and claimed spiritual
kinship with the late Rachel Carson, the author of ``Silent
Spring,'' widely regarded as a founding document in the
environmental movement. Gore mocked industry advertisements showing
children walking through clouds of pesticides to demonstrate their
harmlessness, and likewise, he said, he had been the target of
similar corporate ``propaganda.'' The speech demonstrated Gore's
overall campaign strategy: blending routine rhetoric with his
larger populist theme of ``fighting for the people'' and taking on
big business. The strategy is aimed at Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush, who Gore's camp has accused of being a
captive of big oil.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the first Orthodox
Jew to run for such a high office, skipped campaigning Saturday and
observed the Sabbath by attending services at his synagogue in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON BACKS AWAY FROM LIMELIGHT
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton canceled a round of television interviews
Saturday after concerns were raised from Al Gore's campaign that
the president's five-day pre-convention schedule in Los Angeles
threatened to overshadow the Democratic nominee's message. The
president instead played golf with Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan and Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic convention chairman.
Saturday night, the president and his wife Hillary Clinton, a
Senate candidate from New York, were to attend a fund-raiser with a
cast of Hollywood celebrities that was expected to yield $1 million
for his wife's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   GORE STILL TRAILING BUSH, POLLS SHOW
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday shows Gore trails Bush by 10
points, 48 percent to 38 percent. This is similar to a CBS News
poll released Friday that found Gore trailing Bush, 52 percent to
42 percent. An ABC News poll out Friday put Gore 9 points behind
Bush, 52 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   CASEY FAMILY TO SPEAK AT DNC
</P>
<P>
   The family of former Gov. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who died
this year, will address the Democratic National Convention after a
personal invitation by Gore, Democratic national chairman Joe
Andrew said Saturday. In 1992, Casey, a Democrat, was denied a
convention role because his position against abortion differed
sharply from that adopted in the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTION HELPED BUSH'S NOTORIETY, POLL SHOWS
</P>
<P>
   Even though few Americans watched two hours or more of the
Republican National Convention, a new study shows that Bush
succeeded in increasing awareness that he favors a bigger tax cut
than Gore, and that he wants prescription drugs available to the
elderly. Polls by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found:
</P>
<P>
   After the convention, 62 percent of voters polled said they
identified Bush as the presidential candidate who ``favors the
biggest tax cut,'' up from 54 percent before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   And 31 percent polled after the convention said they knew that
Bush favored providing vouchers to defray prescription drug costs
for the elderly, up from 25 percent before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also spread Gore's position on opposing allowing workers to
invest Social Security taxes in the stock market _ something Bush
advocates. Before the RNC, only 39 percent of voters polled were
aware of this. After the convention, 44 percent said they knew.
</P>
<P>
   GORE WINS NOD FROM LABOR GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's labor pains abated somewhat Friday, as he accepted the
long-awaited endorsement of a powerful union, the United Auto
Workers in Bridgeport, Pa. UAW President Stephen Yokich _ who once
accused Gore of ``holding hands with the profiteers of the world''
for backing a free trade agreement with China _ offered his full
support for the vice president. ``You're going to be our
candidate,'' Yokich told Gore, who pumped his fists in the air as
Yokich reported the unanimous UAW board vote to endorse Gore.

GORE, BUSH MAKE PITCHES IN PA., WASH.

   SPRINGDALE, Pa. _ The two major presidential candidates worked
opposite ends of the country Saturday. Al Gore reaffirmed his
devotion to environmentalism at an appearance in Pennsylvania,
while George W. Bush proclaimed in Washington state, ``There's a
new commander in chief coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to several hundred people on a lawn near the Springdale
home of Rachel Carson, Gore likened himself to the legendary
environmentalist as he warned of the dangers of global warming. He
said Carson's 1962 book, ``Silent Spring,'' which exposed the
dangers of pesticides, was a major lesson for him.
</P>
<P>
   Carson was the target of a ``well-organized, well-funded
attack'' that sought to discredit her, he said. ``We've seen some
of the same things in the battle to do the right thing'' to end
global warming, but ``those who deny global warming are just
flat-out wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush appeared in Everett, Wash. With the USS Abraham
Lincoln in the background, the Texas governor made an appeal to
veterans in the presence of Senator John S. McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated his promise to rely heavily on allies to quell
global conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the peace also means we've got to have a military of
high morale, high spirits,'' he said. ``I wish I could turn to the
soldiers on that ship. . . . I wish they could hear me: Stay in the
military. There's a new commander in chief coming.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday that she and
President Clinton would stay at the Democratic National Convention
just long enough to proclaim their support for Vice President Al
Gore, and then drop completely from sight, doing nothing, she
promised, that might steal attention from the celebration
surrounding Gore's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down, we're gone, absolutely,'' the first lady announced
in an interview, sitting in a suite at the heavily secured Century
City hotel, where the Clintons are staying. ``We're going to be
staying out of sight. Really. We want there to be nothing but a
focus on the convention back in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want there to be any attention _ anywhere _ except on
Joe and Al,'' Mrs. Clinton said, referring to Joseph Lieberman, the
Connecticut senator that Gore has chosen as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who said she was speaking for herself and the
president, made her remarks at a time when Gore's supporters have
assailed them both for embarking on a vigorous schedule of
pre-convention politicking and fund-raising that has distracted
from this climactic moment in Gore's career.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton grew animated at the mention of the criticism, shaking
her head vigorously to dispute the suggestion that the Clintons
were overshadowing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more enthusiastic supporter of Al Gore than I
am,'' she said, adding: ``I just feel so strongly about his
candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is running for the U.S. Senate from New York,
demurred when asked to describe how she and her husband intended to
spend the rest of the week, though an aide said later that they
would be going to a friend's waterside cabin in Lake Placid, N.Y.
When asked if Mr. Clinton was aware of what the first couple was
doing once they finished their prime-time convention speeches on
Monday night, Mrs. Clinton laughed, toyed with a glass of water on
the round dining room table before her, and responded evenly,
``Yes. Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   She discussed the tangled ambitions and agendas of three of the
nation's best-known Democrats _ Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and Gore _ in
the course of an interview in which she talked at length about her
own campaign against Rep. Rick Lazio, and how she hoped the
convention in general, and her 10-minute speech on Monday night,
would provide a lift both to her campaign and Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, gazing through a plate-glass window in the
19th-floor suite at the St. Regis Hotel over Century City and
across a vast and smoggy expanse of Los Angeles, argued that Lazio
was, largely, a different kind of opponent from the one Gore faced
in Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Lazio, she asserted, repeatedly
sought to obscure parts of his record to accommodate the Democratic
electoral terrain in New York, while Bush has run more explicitly
as a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, with an edge of frustration in her voice,
described it as a ``deliberate obfuscation of the record and the
votes that were taken, and a disclaiming of responsibility that I
find troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind having a debate in a campaign with someone who
says, you know, `I don't think we should permit HMOs to be sued,
and here are my three reasons,'' Clinton said. ``As opposed to
someone saying, `Well, I did support a patients bill of rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to Lazio's support of limited Republican
legislation to regulate HMOs, which Lazio has cited in response to
Clinton's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or you know, `I really am pro-choice _ it's just that I'm on
the conservative party line and I've given them a big wink about
what I really mean, and I won't commit to defending Roe v. Wade in
any Supreme Court nomination process in the Senate,''' she said,
continuing her remarks about Lazio. ```But, gee, take me at my
word, because I want to be all things to all people.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the Republican-conservative candidate,'' she said. ``New
York is neither Republican nor conservative when it comes to guns
and choice and education and health care and the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Lazio, responded to
Clinton's remarks by taking note of the amount of time the first
lady has devoted on this trip to raising campaign funds for her
race. ``It's flattering that the first lady would take time out of
her busy soft-money feeding frenzy to attack Congressman Lazio,''
McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, one of a handful she did with New York reporters
in time for the high-circulation Sunday newspapers, came as she
continued to, in effect, use California as a base for her New York
campaign in the midst of the convention festivities. She was
scheduled to attend a fund-raiser Saturday night in Malibu that
could raise anywhere from $1 million to $4 million for her.
</P>
<P>
   That fund-raiser was one of the events that drew some
expressions of concern from Gore's supporters. Clinton, though,
asserted that she had taken pains to avoid any conflicts with
Gore's campaign during their visits here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we're doing has been coordinated with the vice
president and Tipper and top-levels of our staff,'' she said,
referring to the vice president's wife, Tipper Gore. Clinton
emphasized her point by gesturing with a hand loaded down with a
charm bracelet. Asked if that meant that she would allow Gore's
advisers to review her speech before she delivered it on Monday,
Clinton grinned and responded: ``Of course I would. I haven't
written it yet. I worked on it this morning. But you know _ if they
want to see it, I'd be more than happy to show it to them. It's
only 10 minutes long.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, she asserted there was no need for explicit
coordination on what she should say. ``We know each other so
well,'' Clinton said, leaning back in a room that was empty except
for a floral arrangement and trays of cookies and soft drinks. (She
and the president were staying on another floor).
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need to give me talking points,'' she continued.
``We know what our talking points are for this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   As to her own campaign in New York, Clinton said that Lazio was
going to great lengths to camouflage his record, and pointed to his
decision to spend a minimal amount of time at the Republican
convention. ``I think that's why he didn't want to spend a lot of
time in Philadelphia,'' she said, referring to the Republican
convention two weeks ago. ``I think he's hoping that New Yorkers
will somehow not know where he stands and what he has voted for in
the past. I think now that the campaign is into the final stretch,
that's going to be hard to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she believed she was now entering into the a
new phase of the race, and expressed confidence that a contest that
has seemed frozen in place _ with poll after poll showing her tied
with Lazio despite her repeated attacks on his record _ would begin
to move once the conventions were over and people considered the
choice before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of time,'' she said. ``It's a question of
issues. And people understanding what's really at stake in the
election, and what the differences between us are.''

EXCERPTS FROM MRS. CLINTON'S INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Following are excerpts from an interview with
Hillary Rodham Clinton at her hotel in Century City on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a danger that what you and President Clinton are
doing here could overshadow Mr. Gore's week here?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. We've talked about it. Everything we're doing has been
coordinated with the vice president and Tipper and top levels of
our staffs. We're doing everything we can to send a very clear
message that if America liked the Clinton-Gore administration, they
will like the Gore-Lieberman administration. And that there is a
continuity here, a commitment to the same issues, a focus on the
New Democratic philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the convention has been planned the way it is _ where
we came early and we will leave Tuesday morning, and we will join
the Gores and there will be an almost, I don't know how to describe
it exactly, but a kind of passing on, that is, a very explicit
statement by the president about his strong support for and
affection for and admiration for the vice president. And then we're
done. We're gone.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On the race in New York: Why do you think it is that after
everything you've done, in terms of drawing contrasts with your
opponent, you and Mr. Lazio seem to be tied in almost every public
poll?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think people have paid a lot of attention to politics
yet. And this is not at all surprising to me. ... If people really
confront the choices that they face, between me and my opponent,
they will know what happens to be true, which is that my stand on
issues and what I will do in the Senate is much more in line with
the majority of New Yorkers. He's the Republican-conservative
candidate. New York is neither Republican nor conservative when it
comes to guns and choice and education and health care and the
economy. So I have a lot of energy for this coming campaign.

JONES A SURE THING, BUT ALL BETS ARE OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Roy Jones is betting on himself next month. He's
going to lose a bundle doing it, even though he's a sure thing to
defeat challenger Eric Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Jones considers himself the best fighter, pound for pound, on
the planet, and he may well be. He also believes he can make
millions negotiating for himself rather than working in conjunction
with his present boss, HBO. He can't.
</P>
<P>
   That HBO pays the most money in boxing to its stable of fighters
seems to be lost on Jones, who was angry at the deal HBO made with
his representative, Murad Muhammad, for a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   With one pay-per-view fight under his old contract remaining,
Jones has agreed to a Sept. 9 mandatory title defense against
Harding in New Orleans, and HBO has agreed to sell it on
pay-per-view even though no one believes anyone will buy it. They
agreed because Jones's company, Square Ring, is the promoter and
Jones is not getting a cash guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will earn $15 out of every $34.95 sale, which means he
needs 60,000 buys to break even. Boxing people believe Harding will
make $650,000 and Jones will lose about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody but (Mike) Tyson can be a free agent  &UR; today &LR;  and make
big money,'' said John Hornewer, a boxing attorney who advises many
fighters, including WBO heavyweight champion Chris Byrd, IBF
bantamweight champion Tim Austin, and occasionally Jones. ``HBO
pays the most money in the industry and everyone knows it. If you
leave them to become a free agent, where do you go?''
</P>
<P>
   That is the question Jones and Muhammad seem to want answered,
but if they take a financial bath Sept. 9, what do they have to
sell but a fighter who has done little in three attempts on
pay-per-view and will not work with promoter Don King?
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy could walk away with zip from this, but you have to pay a
price for freedom,'' says Muhammad. Perhaps so, but if Jones walks
away with zip, Muhammad may find himself in the worst of positions
_ having allowed his fighter to commit financial suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Where would Jones have to go from there? Probably back to HBO.
</P>
<P>
   HBO Sports president Seth Abraham is a wise negotiator and a guy
who has never let much of anything stand in the way of good
business. That's why it would be no surprise if he approaches Jones
after the financial bloodbath that is coming and hands him a check
and a new deal to continue the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   No one is better at allowing someone to save face than Abraham,
and after Jones gets over the shock of watching Harding earn more
than he does, he may well realize there is no free agency in boxing
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He will if he's as smart as he thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Short jabs
</P>
<P>
   While Jones continues to refuse the one obvious fight he should
take, WBO champion Darius Michalczewski fights on. He is scheduled
to get in with David Telesco Sept. 9 in Germany. Jones destroyed
Telesco a while back, and if Michalczewski can do the same, it
would build interest in a fight with Jones. ``Roy Jones only dares
to open his mouth when I'm far away,'' claims Michalczewski. ``So
far, he is always hiding behind ridiculous purse demands. In the
meantime, even American journalists and fans attack him because
everybody realized that he is running from me. Jones's reproach
that I need biased judges in Germany is ridiculous. I don't need
judges at all.'' Michalczewski is 42-0 with 17 straight title
defenses . . . Shane Mosley will accept Ring magazine's award as
best pound-for-pound fighter next Sunday before the Mauricio
Pastrana-Heriberto Ruiz fight for the IBA junior bantamweight
title. Mosley is only the sixth fighter to be given this honor. The
others were Tyson, Julio Cesar Chavez, Pernell Whitaker, Jones, and
Oscar De La Hoya. The bout will be held at Harrah's in Kansas City.
Mosley, 35-0 (32 KO's), is also one of only six fighters to have
won the lightweight and welterweight titles _ Barney Ross, Henry
Armstrong, Roberto Duran, Whitaker, and De La Hoya are the others .
. . Mosley is awaiting his rematch with De La Hoya, which is
tentatively set for Jan. 20, although De La Hoya has yet to say he
is ready to fight. In fact, word is he has been concentrating on
his singing career and working on his golf game under one of the
sport's top professional trainers, and seldom thinks of boxing . .
. Reportedly, De La Hoya's father continues to protect trainer
Robert Alcazar. Many felt De La Hoya would dump his longtime
trainer after losing to Mosley. More than a few critics blamed
Alcazar for not adjusting De La Hoya's fight plan while Mosley
fought three different fights during the night. Problem with that
theory is De La Hoya made the same mistakes when Mosley fought
lefthanded that he had when he fought Whitaker. De La Hoya claimed
his trainers told him the wrong things to do the first time, which
they did. But has the guy got a memory? . . . Evander Holyfield's
trainer, Don Turner, has not been happy about rumors he will be
replaced as trainer of Michael Grant when he makes his October
comeback against Robert Daniels. According to the 61-year-old
Turner, no one has spoken to him about being replaced and Grant
has, in fact, assured him otherwise; yet the rumors persist. If
someone wants to claim Grant wasn't ready for Lennox Lewis, who
destroyed him in two rounds in April, that would be obvious, but
Turner trains the fighter, he doesn't make the fights. If Grant was
in over his head, he was put there by his managerial team. Jim
Thomas, legal adviser for Holyfield and a part of Grant's
management team, acknowledged last week that while Turner isn't
out, things may be changing after the Lewis debacle, regardless of
the fact Turner had no culpability in his fighter's meltdown.
``Mike is considering the possibility of adding someone to his
training team,'' Thomas said. ``He hasn't made a decision, but it's
a distortion for anyone to say Don is out. Don is still the head
trainer, but we know how Don is. If whoever else comes in and there
starts to be some undercutting or overcutting, it will have to be
dealt with.'' Thomas tried to compare the situation with the time
Holyfield brought in veteran Texas trainer Kenny Weldon to work the
handpads. Weldon gave the impression he was actually there for more
than that and Turner grew concerned about his position. ``Don was
upset and I went to Evander and Evander told him to get over it,''
Thomas recalled. ``He said Don was the head trainer. Michael lacks
that maturity.'' If Grant is blaming Turner for the amateurish way
he fought Lewis, he lacks sense. No trainer on earth would have
told him to charge out of his corner and start winging punches that
left him totally exposed. Worse, the day of the fight, Turner tried
to talk with Grant about the battle plan and Grant, who had
appeared to be swallowed up by the magnitude of the event all week,
walked away.

brother, Vitaly, who quit in his corner with a rotator cuff
problem. ``If they have any other brothers, Chris will fight them,
too,'' said Hornewer, Byrd's adviser . . . The latest Cuban Olympic

who fought Friday night, has been in King's doghouse after missing
a Showtime date eight months ago but was glad to be back working
for King again. ``You don't go to war with the Kings,'' Hornewer
said. Hornewer said that's why he felt the decision of WBA
welterweight champion James Page not to fight  &UR; last night &LR;  was
``professional suicide,'' regardless of the validity of his case.
``If freedom comes at a price, pay it, but don't lose your title
doing it. The purse bid was $112,000 (for Page) and Don was the
only bidder. I know the fight didn't come off in 60 days (as it
should have under WBA rules or a new purse bid should have been
ordered), but Page hadn't fought in a year; so what's better:
earning $112,000 or earning nothing and being stripped of your

promoter, Vlad Wharton, had a tough weekend in Phoenix even though
his fighter destroyed Chavez. First, he's short $163,000 in gate

10 years Ward's junior, but at 34, Ward seems to be coming into his

the use of judge Steve Weisfeld, who has a longtime relationship

swing vote, and it gave the bout to Lazcano by the widest margin.

GORDON IS KING OF THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past three years, Jeff Gordon's dominance on road-course
venues has grown to Tiger-like proportions over the rest of his
NASCAR Winston Cup competitors. Gordon is such a factor that his
presence makes him an overwhelming favorite to take the checkered
flag.
</P>
<P>
   He is, simply, the man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to road courses, so far, no one has.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the last six road-course races on the Winston Cup
circuit, Gordon will attempt to extend his winning streak to seven
when he starts Sunday's Global Crossing at The Glen at Watkins
Glen, N.Y. While he has made it seem effortless, Gordon admits his
impressive record has not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked really hard on my road-course driving and we stepped
up our road-course program,'' he said. ``I can't believe we've won
six in a row. I've got to hand it to this team; we haven't grown
complacent during this streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly trying to improve our road-course program.
``We can't relax because the competition is so tough out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Gordon lost on a road course was June 1997 at
Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., finishing second. Since
then, he has been virtually unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   So, it has begged the question: Can anyone stop him?
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin, who came close to snapping Gordon's streak this
year at Sears Point, offered one unconventional suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I do have the sure-fire way of somebody else winning
on these road courses,'' Marlin said. ``All the drivers are going
to get together, take up a collection, and sponsor Jeff in Formula
One for a year. Of course, the way things have been going, he'd
probably be off that weekend for Sears Point and decide to come
back to run that one race.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon, a three-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion, is
eighth in the point standings, more than 400 points astern of
current leader Bobby Labonte, he has managed to win twice this
year, including at Sears Point, where he held off Marlin in the
late stages of the Save Mart/Kragen 350K to keep his streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it came a whole lot closer to ending at Sears Point
than people might have thought,'' Marlin said. ``We were giving it
a pretty good run there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon has proven Tiger-like on road courses, where he has
practically lapped the field in his six consecutive victories,
Michael Waltrip said the streak is due to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, somebody will trip him up at Watkins Glen, I would
think,'' said Waltrip. ``I can't imagine him winning another one.
He does things that you can't really figure out sometimes, but I
think somebody will get him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things never go on forever. Now it's just a question as
to whether `forever' comes this week or next year at Sears Point.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major moves
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend when older brother Terry's streak of 655 starts
came to an end, Bobby Labonte celebrated a milestone triumph _ one
that could very well launch him to his first Winston Cup
championship _ in last Saturday's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis
Motor Speedway. Labonte (3,006 points) padded his lead over Dale
Jarrett by 87 points and collected a whopping $831,225 for
finishing ahead of runner-up Rusty Wallace. It was Labonte's 14th
career Winston Cup victory and his second ``major,'' after a
triumph in the 1996 Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte. ``It's definitely a
dream come true when you win any race,'' Bobby said. ``Then, when
you can win the Coca-Cola 600, the Brickyard 400 now, and every
race between the two, hopefully, from then on, too, it's just a
great feeling. You see the guys who have won this race and you just
wish you could be part of it. I guess if we had come down the front
straightaway upside down and on fire, that would have been the
ultimate. But, anyway, it's just awesome. To know the guys who have
won this race, the prestige behind this race, the amount of press
that goes on here, and the fact that they're going to have a
Formula One race here this year _ on the same track _ that's cool.
I think it's just neat. There are races that are more special and
this is definitely one of them.'' . . . Terry Labonte will sit out
Sunday's race at Watkins Glen and turn over his No. 5 Kellogg's
Corn Flakes Chevrolet to Ron Hornaday, the Busch Series driver for
Dale Earnhardt's outfit. Labonte plans to return for the Pepsi 400
a week from Sunday at Michigan Speedway after sitting out the
Brickyard 400 because of lingering dizziness from a concussion
sustained in a July 1 crash at Daytona. ``This is going to give
Terry two weeks off to rest and recuperate,'' said John Hendrick,
president of Hendrick Motorsports. ``We're grateful to Dale
Earnhardt and the DEI organization for allowing Ron to come over
and help us out this weekend. As he's shown throughout his career,
in both trucks and cars, Ron's capable of running up front every
week, regardless of the series. We think he'll do a good job in
relief until Terry rejoins us at Michigan.'' . . . Jeremy Mayfield,
who also sat out the Brickyard because of a concussion from a
violent wall crash last Friday at Indy, will miss Sunday's race.
He'll be relieved by road-racing expert Tom Hubert in the No. 12
Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. ``Especially because of where we are in the
points right now, there is no sense in taking a chance,'' said car
owner Michael Kranefuss. ``We'd rather let him rest for one more
week and be ready to go for all the key races coming up right at
Watkins Glen.'' Said Mayfield: ``Honestly, I feel fine and
everybody says everything is OK. ``I'd much rather be driving than
not driving, believe me. But everybody seems to think this will be
for the best in the long run. All I want to do is get back in the
racecar.'' . . . As has been rumored for months, CART car owner
Chip Ganassi officially entered the Winston Cup derby when he
acquired a majority stake in Team SABCO, owned by Felix Sabates.
Ganassi, whose CART team has won the last four consecutive
championships and the 2000 Indy 500 with driver Juan Montoya,
announced he will switch from Chevrolet and campaign the Dodge
Intrepid. He becomes the fourth CART owner to field a Winston Cup
team, with Roger Penske, Carl Haas, and Cal Wells. ``If you have
any competitive spirit, you can't ignore NASCAR Winston Cup
racing,'' said Ganassi. ``It's impressive to see the level of
competition, the close racing, and the way NASCAR touches the fans
every day.'' . . . The career of Indy Racing League driver Scott
Harrington has come to a perilous crossroads after he was arrested
for driving under the influence of alchohol last Saturday in
Indianapolis. It marks Harrington's third DUI offense in the last
eight months, which could carry a jail sentence of up to three
years. His latest offense comes after he reached a plea bargain on
his DUI arrests of Jan. 9 and May 27, serving 80 hours of community
service. ``I've got to get some help and deal with these
problems,'' Harrington told the Indianapolis Star. ``This is not an
isolated experience, and you don't do things like this without
having a problem. I've made some bad decisions and some serious
errors in judgment.'' Harrington will not be able to race in the
next IRL race Aug. 27 at Sparta, Ky., until he receives medical
clearance. ``I've had a lot of problems in my personal and
professional life lately, but that's no excuse,'' he said. ``I'm
not as strong as I should be, and I let it get the best of me.''

CASSERLY'S HOMEWORK WILL BE COMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Former Redskins general manager Charley Casserly
had just arrived in Atlanta late Friday afternoon after spending
Thursday in Pittsburgh to scout the Steelers-Panthers game. By the
time this weekend is over, Casserly, the GM of the new Houston
franchise, will have seen four games. All of this for what? His
franchise is two years away from officially existing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making decisions on players based on their history, so
the more history you have and the longer our scouting staff works
together, the better decisions we'll make when the time comes,'' he
said. ``It's important we start to work as a unit. The first
decisions we'll make on players are going to be signing street free
agents and in the expansion draft. If you can follow someone you'll
have better knowledge. An example is quarterback Trent Green. We
scouted him in college and in his first year at San Diego. We put
him on injured reserve and he sat a whole year. The next year he
threw 25 passes for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly said he'll be responsible for signing 100 players in
Houston's first season. He and his 12-man staff already are
evaluating players who may be free agents in two years. And
Casserly already is scouting players who will be available in the
college draft in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gathering all the background you can is vital in this
business,'' he said. ``The longer I'm in this business, the more
important it is that you have experienced people who can evaluate
talent. We've hired seven guys with 20 or more years in the NFL. We
have eight scouts who have had teams go to the Super Bowl. Every
one of our scouts has had a divisional championship and won at
least one playoff game. We have a group who knows how to do the
job. The challenge is meshing together.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those talent evaluators is former Patriots director of
player personnel Bobby Grier, who is the associate director of
college personnel with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby has a lot of experience and he understands how the
process works,'' said Casserly. ``He's been in charge of a team and
to bring that type of experience into a new organization is
invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly said he has a large staff because in the beginning
there's so much work to do. There are so many players to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouting is becoming more and more important,'' he said. ``You
can't keep your team together very long anymore because of free
agency, so you have to reload. You need different avenues to reload
your team. You can't ignore veteran free agents and you certainly
can't ignore the June market. In my final year in Washington we
brought in (fullback) Larry Centers, (defensive end) Marco Coleman,
and (offensive tackle) Andy Heck. We also signed Terry Allen out of
that market and he gave us 1,300 yards of offense two straight
years. You have to find players who aren't so expensive. You have
to save money somewhere because the core players eat up so much of
your cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly already is insisting he will take ``the best player
available'' when draft day comes in two years. ``If it's a
quarterback, that's great. If it isn't, don't panic, just build a
team and wait for a time when you can go get that young quarterback
to build around.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly has two more important positions to fill _
capologist/negotiator, which will be hired next year, and head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   He said there's no pressure to hire a coach a year in advance,
but ``if we can do that, great.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the Arizona Diamondbacks were entering the
National League, Buck Showalter was hired two seasons in advance.
He managed the Diamondbacks' first Single A team and
``coordinated'' for a couple of years. The Diamondbacks feared
Showalter, who was the hot young manager at the time, would not be
available if they waited another year. Tom Coughlin was hired a
year in advance in Jacksonville. On the flip side, Chris Palmer
went from coordinator in Jacksonville to head coach in Cleveland
without much time to get his team together. Ditto Dom Capers, who
went from defensive coordinator in Pittsburgh to head coach in
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly claims he doesn't yet have someone in mind, though
Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher would have been the choice had he not
signed a long-term extension with the Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like someone who has head coaching experience,'' said
Casserly. ``If we don't get that person, we don't get that. That
won't eliminate college coaches. You want a coach who's a leader;
when he walks in the room he's in charge. Patience, the ability to
work with young players, mental toughness, and a vision will be
very important elements.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular candidates are the same ones who surfaced when the
Patriots were looking following last season. Capers is on the list,
but he's in a great situation in Jacksonville as the Jaguars'
defensive coordinator. He's also earning head coach money from the
Panthers for a couple more years, which may ease him right into big
money in Houston. Capers could also be the heir apparent to
Coughlin if the gruff Jaguars coach has a disappointing season.
Houston native Gary Kubiak, Denver defensive coordinator Greg
Robinson, Arizona defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis, Tampa Bay
assistant head coach Herman Edwards, LSU's Nick Saban, Florida's
Steve Spurrier, Chicago offensive coordinator Gary Crowton, and
even former Patriots coach Pete Carroll are possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly and team owner Bob McNair, both personable and public
relations conscious, would also want that in their head coach. No
personality-impaired coaches would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, who returned to the league last season, went with
the Jacksonville method of expansion by signing lesser-known,
less-experienced players. Which way will Houston go?
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape has changed dramatically since Jacksonville and
Carolina,'' said Casserly. ``I'm not sure you have a choice. You
have to emphasize youth. We won't look pretty for a couple of
years, I'll guarantee that. Tune in a couple of years down the
road. The free agent market isn't what it used to be. The market
has dried up young players because now teams are tying them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is currently telling McNair and Casserly that Houston
will get the top choice in the 2002 draft and receive extra picks
in the middle of every round. Casserly and McNair believe that
should be changed. They feel their draft picks need to be moved
from the middle to the top of each round.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the subject of in which division Houston will play.
Bob Kraft, among others, agrees with McNair that Houston should be
an AFC Central team. Saints owner Tom Benson feels Houston and New
Orleans should be in the same division. But after awarding the
franchise, most owners agreed the best rivalry would be for Houston
to be in the same division as Tennessee, the team that left Houston
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Houston will unveil a nickname and logo Sept. 6. Uniforms will
follow. One thing is clear, the Houston franchise will distance
itself from anything to do with the old Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly appears to be having a ball putting this together. He's
says he's picked the brains of guys who have been through expansion
_ Capers, Bill Polian, Joe Mack, Carmen Policy, Palmer, and Dwight
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked them a lot of questions about different things and
I'll continue to ask them,'' he said. ``They're all great and all
friends. The owner here is a fabulous guy. He's given us the
resources to be the best. The key is patience.''
</P>

   Back on the job
</P>
<P>
   He was coaching from a golf cart Thursday when the Dolphins beat
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. One side of his body now has half a
kidney, but former Patriots offensive line coach Paul Boudreau, now
Miami's line coach, is just tickled he's still alive. Right before
training camp, Boudreau noticed blood in his urine, a situation
that worsened. He was told by a Miami doctor he had a cancerous
growth in his kidney and that the kidney would have to be removed.
Boudreau balked at this and began making calls. One was to Globe
columnist Will McDonough, who called his medical sources, involved
Joe Browne from the league office, and before you knew it Boudreau
was in the care of Dr. Andrew Novick of the Cleveland Clinic, the
world's top authority in kidney surgery. ``Dr. Novick has performed
3,000 of these, more than anyone in the world,'' said Boudreau, a
former assistant coach at Boston College. ``He's performed surgery
on three kings and an old broken down football coach.'' Novick
salvaged half the kidney and told Boudreau it is still viable.
Boudreau appears to be on the road back as the cancer was confined
to the golf ball-sized tumor. ``I owe a lot to a lot of people,''
said Boudreau. ``Will McDonough got the ball rolling for me. Joe
Browne helped so much. The Cleveland Browns _ Carmen Policy and
Chris Palmer _ were wonderful to me and my family and Mr. (Wayne)
Huizenga (the Dolphins' owner) flew me up there in his private
jet.'' Boudreau said Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt has told him to
take it easy and return when he's stronger. In Boudreau's absence,
retired Buffalo line coach Tom Bresnahan has guided the offensive
line, but a still sore Boudreau returned to work Thursday and is
back performing most of his duties . . . Check out these stats:
Brian Smith, a 5-foot-11-inch, 225-pound linebacker with the Idaho
Stallions of the Arena League has made a league-record 164 tackles,
including 90 unassisted . . . Chris Canty had a rough go of it in
New England, but he's fulfilled Grier's vision and is a nickel back
with the Seattle Seahawks. Canty was asked by a Seattle reporter
what characteristic he would change about himself. He said, ``My
attitude. I don't like taking a lot of stuff from people and being
in this profession, you've got to listen to your coaches and take
criticism. That's my biggest problem, but I'm getting there. I'm
learning.''

<P>
   Breath of fresh air?

   Bill Romanowski, who is facing felony charges after being
accused of using his wife's prescription drugs, obviously has an
obsession with gaining an edge. Not only was he allegedly ingesting
his wife's diet pills, which helped to speed up his metabolism, the
fiery Denver linebacker invested in a $6,000 hyperbaric chamber,
used mostly by deep sea divers to recover from surfacing too
quickly. Romanowski brought the device to the Broncos' Greely,
Colo., training camp. He would climb into the 7-foot chamber, close
the door, then breathe the rich oxygen, which supposedly improves
endurance . . . How small is this world that new Redskins teammates
Deion Sanders and Irving Fryar, who never really knew each other
but now sit side by side in the locker room, were chatting one day
about their families and realized their grandparents were brother
and sister, therefore making them cousins? . . . One supposes if
Troy Aikman has one last great gasp left and if Emmitt Smith can
still run and if their young defense comes together the Cowboys
could still be a factor in the NFC East. But they're taking hits.
Last week, cornerback Kevin Smith, suffering from nagging hamstring
problems, left the team. He's contemplating retirement. Also
thinking about calling it quits is right tackle Erik Williams. They
are two players who are hard to replace. The worst thing is Kevin
Smith would count $1.5 million against the cap. There have been
reports the Jaguars are trying to trade for Williams given they've
lost seven offensive linemen to injuries, but Williams appears
serious about hanging it up . . . The Dolphins have been written
off by a lot of people, but their defense, which ranked fifth last
season, could be the best in the NFL. The consensus among the
players is that all they need is to be consistent. Last season, the
Dolphins held opponents to fewer than 21 points in eight of the
first 11 games, but failed to achieve that in four of the last
five. The Dolphins say that with another year to jell, watch out.
And their offense might be better than we thought. They beat the
Buccaneers, 15-13, Thursday. Granted, all the points came on Olinde
Mare field goals, but there were good signs, like 76 yards rushing
in the first half, six third-down conversions in that span, and 18
minutes of possession time in the first half. It means Miami's
running game and offensive line aren't as bad as we thought, even
going up against one of the best defenses in football. The Dolphins
even showed a bit of razzle-dazzle by using receiver Bert Emanuel
(a former option quarterback at Rice) at quarterback for two
third-down attempts. He converted both, one on a handoff, the other
on a keeper. Damon Huard fumbled and threw an interception in the
red zone, but he did move the offense. Why would the Dolphins use
Emanuel at quarterback while the Patriots don't appear ready to do
that with Michael Bishop? Because Huard is Huard and Drew Bledsoe
is Drew Bledsoe. When you have an unproven quarterback like Huard,
you can pull it off. When you have a Pro Bowler, doing such a thing
would be embarrassing to the star player and mess with Bledsoe's
confidence. Now you wonder how good the Dolphins might have been
had they been able to obtain Barry Sanders from the Detroit Lions
in the offseason.

   Week 5 for Doug Flutie? That's what he thinks. He tore his groin
in training camp and the recovery will take at least that long.
Flutie said he doesn't feel any pain just walking around, but when
he tried to side-step a trash can at a mall near the Bills'
training camp last week, he felt a twinge. In the meantime, the
Bills will go, as planned, with talented Rob Johnson at
quarterback. Interesting to hear some of the younger Buffalo
veterans trashing the departed Thurman Thomas, Andre Reed, and
Bruce Smith, hinting that perhaps they did not provide the
leadership everyone assumed they had . . . Offensive line injuries
are killing teams, particularly Jacksonville, which has lost those
seven linemen, including tackle Leon Searcy. That's why the Jets
just begged Jumbo Elliott to come out of retirement. Now the Jets
can match the Patriots' experience at left tackle . . . Do you keep
believing that Kordell Stewart can be a force in the NFL or do you
just throw up your hands and admit that he's not a No. 1
quarterback? Who knows whether the Steelers have or will reach that
crossroad. In two exhibition games, and we remind all they are just
exhibitions, Stewart, who was one of the lowest-rated passers in
football a year ago, is 6 for 22 for 101 yards. The Steelers, who
must generate offense, are getting none from the man who needs to
do the generating. Plan B would be the immobile Kent Graham, who
has been an efficient 10 for 18 for 95 yards in two part-time
stints. Graham, a former starter with the Giants, is a guy veteran
players like to play around. He's considered the consummate
teammate and players have faith he can move the offense . . .
Robert Brooks, the former sensational receiver with the Green Bay
Packers who was forced to retire because of neck injuries, had an
excellent workout last week for the Broncos. Brooks is also being
pursued by the Raiders and Seahawks and though they're denying it,
the Eagles have their eye on him . . . John Hannah, who was voted
the Patriots Player of the Century, was enshrined in the College
Football Hall of Fame this weekend in South Bend, Ind. Hannah
(Alabama) joined 21 others, including Herschel Walker (Georgia),
Billy Kilmer (UCLA), Greg Pruitt (Oklahoma) and Willie Lanier
(Morgan State), as inductees . . . Just as Chargers quarterback
Ryan Leaf was beginning to make a comeback he felt a pop in his
surgically repaired shoulder in practice last week. Leaf, 24, has
been a bust compared with the quarterback taken one spot ahead of
him in 1998, Peyton Manning. But with all of his problems on and
off the field, there had been a feeling lately that Leaf might
salvage what many believed was going to be an illustrious career,
even better than his predecessor at Washington State, Bledsoe . . .
Slowly but surely, many of agent Tank Black's clients have begun to
find other representation. Black, who is serving time in federal
prison for money laundering, took some clients for thousands of
dollars. One former client is Allen, who now is represented by Gary
Uberstine. Allen is still interested in resuming his career. At
this point, Allen would only be added to a team's roster because of
injury. ``I have ongoing talks with teams, but it's mostly a case
where if a running back gets injured Terry would be able to resume
his career,'' said Uberstine. ``He's kept in shape and he's ready.
He's just waiting for a call.'' Uberstine spoke to the Patriots
about Allen, but there was no interest . . . Uberstine also is
gearing up for talks with the Patriots regarding tackle Chad Eaton,
who can become an unrestricted free agent after this season. If
Eaton has a good year, and so far he appears on that path, he could
demand a big paycheck next season . . . Antonio Langham is one of
the feel-good stories in Patriots camp, a guy whose career hit rock
bottom but who now feels he can get it back. ``Sometimes it takes
you to come down here from up here, to get back here,'' he said,
moving his hand from his waist to his head. ``A lot of people look
at it like you're only playing for the minimum after making money.
Right now, it's not a concern of money. Right now, I want to get my
game to the level it can be. Wherever I have to come from, I'll
come from. I think it's come a long way. I feel the drive and
intensity and willingness to compete again. Sometimes situations
take the drive out of you, but you go someplace else and you get
that back. This situation has brought the drive back. I never
questioned my physical ability because I always felt I had that.''

BLACKHAWKS BRASS INVITES FACEOFF WITH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come one, come all. Such was the open invitation the Blackhawks
extended to their fans late last month, swinging wide the United
Center doors for Hawks followers to attend what could have been
billed as a hockey fan's midsummer dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New England town meeting is the concept,'' said Hawks
general manager Mike Smith, who makes his permanent home on
Martha's Vineyard, where his wife owns and operates an antiques
shop. ``Once a year, the citizens have the right to sit down and
talk to town officials.''
</P>
<P>
   And so they came, more than 550 Hawks fans, to fire questions at
Smith, new head coach Alpo Suhonen, and Peter Wirtz, representing
his father, Bill Wirtz, longtime owner of the bedraggled franchise.
By Smith's count, nearly 70 percent of the questions were directed
his way, with disgruntled fans quizzing him about what he's going
to do to bring fortune back to a club that has missed the playoffs
three straight seasons and hasn't won a Cup since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never what I'd call contentious,'' said Smith, who held
similar town meetings when he was the GM in Winnipeg and proposed
one two years ago when he was working in Toronto _ only to have it
shot down, he said, by Leafs boss Ken Dryden. ``People aren't going
to come in there and call you a jerk in front of all these other
people. In fact, there was some humor to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One citizen of Hawkville, said Smith, stood at the microphone
and flatly stated the club wouldn't improve until the GM dealt Eric
Daze. Later in the proceedings, another fan asked Smith which
player(s) he would deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I asked for volunteers,'' said Smith. ``And of course, from
back in the crowd I hear, `Eric Daze!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his experience in Winnipeg, where the open mike
sessions eventually brought as many as 1,500 Jets fans to the
arena, Smith expects the crowds in Chicago to grow over the years.
In order to get a true pulse of the fans, he said, the meetings
can't be restricted to season ticket-holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's just for season ticket-holders,'' he said, ``that's
nothing more than a marketing ploy. Let's say the Bruins had a town
meeting. Well, the guy who can't afford to come to the FleetCenter
to see every game should have the same right to have his feelings
heard as the guy who can be there every game. We are selling
accountability. There comes the point, I think, where you have to
put yourself out there and be held accountable. A true town hall
meeting is for all citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Bruins fans would relish the chance to sit down and
talk shop with Messrs. Harry Sinden, Mike O'Connell, club owner
Jeremy Jacobs, and head coach Pat Burns. Based on the venom spewed
on talk radio here over the decades, it quite likely would turn
contentious, if not downright combustible. The Bruins have missed
the playoffs two of the past four seasons, and the Cup hasn't been
waltzed through City Hall Plaza since 1972. Fans of the once-proud
franchise constantly complain about high ticket prices and repeated
postseason failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said ticket prices are high _ which they
are,'' Smith said. ``One guy said, `These guys are way overpaid.'
Then later a guy gets up and says, `Until you spend another $8
million in salary, you're not going to be any good.' I don't agree
with what he said, but the two statements show the contradiction:
if you're going to spend on salary, it has to be reflected in the
ticket prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Lending an ear to vox populi won't change a club's fortunes one
point in the standings. If, say, Bill from Everett were to stand up
and assail Sinden and O'Connell with epithets, then it no doubt
would make for sensational film at 11 and great sound clips for
shocktalk radio. But it wouldn't squeeze another assist out of
Andrei Kovalenko in 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given that Jacobs is an absentee owner, that
regular-season results have fallen off badly, that icon Ray Bourque
is now in the Rockies, that there hasn't been a high-profile free
agent signing since Kevin Stevens, that the last trip to the Cup
finals was in 1990, it sure would be one fun night to watch and
listen if the paying saints of Bruins Nation came marching to the
Vault to have their say.
</P>
<P>
   Just for one night, close the accounting room and swing wide the
doors of accountability.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Market crash
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of Philly have it that ex-Bruin Stevens agreed to a
one-year deal with the Flyers that will pay him only $400,000 _ a
paycut of some $2.8 million from his 1999-2000 salary with the
Rangers. But, remember, Stevens is returning after his January
arrest on possession of crack cocaine, and he said in an interview
with the Globe in the spring that, if necessary, he would accept as
little as an invitation to an NHL camp to prove that he can still
play. The Flyers, obviously, offered more. On top of the dough,
Stevens also will have veteran Rick Tocchet by his side to help
him, shall we say, skate his lane. Good for the Flyers, and good
for Stevens. Word around the league is that Wayne Gretzky, included
in the prospective ownership group of the Coyotes, desperately
wanted to bring Tocchet back to Phoenix. But the slow sales
transaction in Arizona has left the Great One little more than an
interested _ and somewhat peeved _ spectator, for now . . . Alexei
Yashin, showing no signs of relenting and returning to the Senators
for at least one more season (at $3.6 million), is back in Finland,
training under the watchful eye of Russian Olympic coach Vladimir
Yurzinov . . . Brad McCrimmon, who 21 years ago this September came
to Bruins training camp with fellow first-round pick Bourque
(McCrimmon was picked 15th overall, seven slots below Bourque),
signed on as assistant coach with Calgary last week, to work under
Don Hay. Often forgotten around here: McCrimmon was on the Flames'
backline when they won their Stanley Cup in '89 . . . Randy
Hillier, another ex-Boston blueliner from the early '80s, joined
the Pittsburgh staff as an assistant coach under Ivan Hlinka,
joining Bruins short-timer Joe Mullen and Rick Kehoe.

<P>
   Jobs wanted
</P>
<P>
   There's less than a month to go before the start of training
camp and Bay State goalies Garth Snow and Tom Barrasso are still
looking for work. Snow had a tickle from the Thrashers, but GM Don
Waddell opted for Czech backstop Milan Hnilicka (2 years/$1.1
million), former property of both the Isles and Rangers. Early
summer rumors had the Red Wings inking Barrasso to a deal,
reuniting him with Scotty Bowman (both ex-Sabres), but right now
the former Acton-Boxboro standout remains shut out of work . . . A
recent USA Today story revealed that In the Game, a company that
produces NHL trading cards, cut up the goaltending pads of the
immortal Georges Vezina as part of a marketing ploy, inserting
minute portions of the desecrated goods into a memorabilia set of
cards. As part of the set, the company also carved up a Terry
Sawchuk blocker, gloves from Turk Broda and Jacques Plante, a
Vladislav Tretiak sweater, and Johnny Bower sticks. ``All this has
a precedent in the relics of religion, specifically Catholicism,''
said Dick Johnson, curator of the Sports Museum of New England.
``In Catholicism _ and I'm Catholic _ people talk about the
splinters of the true cross, and various relics of the saints.
Well, what these card companies do is nothing short of vandalism.
Cutting up a stick, I guess you could say is splinters of the truly
crass.'' Johnson's solution: card manufacturers could insert
scratch tickets, allowing one lucky winner to collect, say,
Sawchuk's blocker, or Vezina's pads, etc. ``Please,'' exorted
Johnson, ``deliver us from these empty marketing suits!'' . . . Ed
Carpenter, Boston University's longtime sports information
director, recently made the vigil to Windsor, Nova Scotia,
considered by many puckologists to be the place where hockey was
first played in North America. Windsor farmer Howard Dill, grower
of giant pumpkins (600-plus pounds), owns a stretch of land that
includes Long Pond, the humble kettle where a wooden puck allegedly
was first dropped. ``My wife and I sat on a bench at one end of the
pond,'' said Carpenter. ``The setting is just unbelievable. If
someone wrote the whole thing as a script, people would say,
`C'mon, who are you trying to kid?' '' It's a long way to Windsor,
but it's worth the trip, just to sit where the Carpenters sat,
never mind the added benefit of Dill's rich storytelling. Don't
dare die a hockey fan without getting there. It's as close to
Cooperstown as hockey gets, with barely a trace of commercialism.

   The Hurricanes will start 2000-01 with no fewer than 10 veterans
deleted from their lineup, including Paul Coffey and Kovalenko,
both of whom bolted to the Bruins as free agents. Others not
returning: Gary Roberts, Robert Kron, Sean Hill, Nolan Pratt,
Curtis Leschyshyn, Sandy McCarthy, Mark Fitzpatrick, and Paul
Ranheim. Notice how the Canes threw $25.5 million to Sandis
Ozolinsh, acquired from Colorado, after staging a monumental
tug-of-war last season with franchise center Keith Primeau? A
recent report in New York had Isles GM Mike Milbury categorizing
the change in the Canes' philosophy as ``managerial
schizophrenia.'' . . . In case you missed it, Al Coates, knocked
off the job as GM in Calgary, was hired by Glen Sather to run the
Rangers' AHL franchise in Hartford. Sather also retained Don
Maloney as assistant GM and brought in Tom Renney, onetime bench
boss in Vancouver, as director of player personnel . . . No one
from City Hall has called to ask me, but it says here the perfect
solution for Fenway Deux would be a land swap with BU, including
the three West Campus towers, Walter Brown Arena, Nickerson Field
(nee Braves Field), and, if needed, the ancient Armory. BU would be
left with space for new dorms and various athletic facilities
(including a new rink) where Fenway now sits. No eminent domain. An
access ramp off the Mass. Pike, right into the Commonwealth Ave.
grounds. And, no doubt, far less tax money burned up for private
enterprise. Put Mike Eruzione in charge tomorrow and stop the
insanity. ``Sounds great,'' said Eruzione, the ex-Olympic hero
whose mission at BU these days is to gain funding for a campus
sports complex. Miracle Mike: ``We'd love to do it. And if someone
wants to build our facility for us, that would clinch it.'' . . .
Will Peter Popovic be an upgrade behind the Boston blue line?
Jacques Demers, his former coach in Montreal, once projected him
for NHL stardom, but that never happened. But at 6 feet 6 inches,
235 pounds, if he grows into the job here in the Hub, we can call
him the Boston Pops . . . Now that Molson Inc. has dimmed the
lights for last call with the Canadiens, wouldn't it be a hoot if
Budweiser, already with bleu, blanc et rouge in its logo, bought
the Habs? Cheers. Don't be surprised, says one source, if Delaware
North Companies _ the Jacobs empire _ enters the bidding for the
Molson Centre, if the team and the building are sold as separate
entities.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Nobody knows exactly how much faster the new
neck-to-ankle bodysuits make a swimmer (3 percent is the guess).
But now that they've been declared legal, nobody wants to be
without one. More than four-fifths of the competitors (everybody
but the breaststrokers, who find them constrictive) at the US
Olympic trials here took the blocks in one version or another of
the form-fitting Lycra blend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wear it till I die,'' vows Tom Malchow, who set
the world record in the 200-meter butterfly in June wearing a
bodysuit. ``Do I think it helped me get the world record? Yes. Do I
think I would have gotten it without it? No. Do I think I would
eventually get the world record without it? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a bodysuit, swimmers say, is like changing skins with a
Great White. ``It feels like you're sliding through the water,''
says Malchow. ``You feel like I imagine a shark does.'' Except that
a shark doesn't have to put it on. ``It's like pulling on nylons,''
groans Kristy Kowal. ``Only 10 times worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are there more than twice as many swimmers (1,300) at these
trials as there were in 1996 (570)? Because USA Swimming scrubbed
its usual summer nationals and invited everybody here for a taste
of Olympian pressure. That made for jammed warmup lanes, but they
were roomy compared with the overcrowding at the recent masters
worlds in Munich. ``There were 7,000 swimmers there,'' says former
US Olympic coach Peter Daland. ``That was a big meet.''
</P>
<P>
   How could a swimming record that stood for 18 years (Mary T.
Meagher's 57.93 in the 100-meter butterfly) be surpassed eight
times in less than a year? Could be what track people called the
Roger Bannister effect, the shattering of the mental barrier of the
four-minute mile. Once Jenny Thompson went 57.88 last August, 57.93
seemed routine. Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands went under it
twice in May and July, and Thompson and Dara Torres did it five
times in two days here. Torres set an American record of 57.58 in
Wednesday's prelims, where Thompson did 57.89. Thompson went 57.59
in the semis, then 57.78 in the final, where Torres did 57.86. The
world mark, held by de Bruijn, is now 56.64.

   The selection committees that will choose the final three women
and two men for the US Olympic gymnastics team at the FleetCenter
next weekend will be working with a loudly-ticking clock. Not only
will the spectators be twiddling their thumbs waiting for the
six-member teams to be marched out, NBC will be waiting, too. Not
that the committees won't have been conferring all week, but the
obvious picks will already have made the team based on their
scores. The federation has promised that the process will be quick.
If it's longer than 15 minutes, the selectors are going to need
earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they're hoping for a specialist's spot on the team, the
three women (Shannon Miller, Jeanette Antolin, Amanda Stroud)
looking for injury waivers into the trials will have to show their
competitive readiness on all four events (bars, beam, floor, vault)
before the selection committee on Tuesday. ``It's an all-around
meet,'' declares federation president Bob Colarossi, who says that
any specialist chosen would have to have a major impact on one
event. That would mean either a medal possibility on one apparatus
or the ability to jack up the team score significantly. Only one of
the three has that ability _ Miller, who won gold on the beam in
Atlanta. Miller, still recovering from a cracked shinbone, pulled
out of last month's nationals after competing only once on bars.

   Turns out that the extended dispute over the makeup of the US
women's softball team was much ado about nothing. The last in a
line of arbitrators ruled that the original 15 players picked last
fall will play in Sydney after all. Julie Smith, who was left off
the team after winning a gold medal last time, challenged the
selection process, which led to a repicking, then another. By then,
after months of acrimony, Smith said she wouldn't take a spot even
if it was awarded her. Eight Atlanta veterans, including
38-year-olds Dot Richardson and Sheila Douty, made the team . . .
US Olympic women's soccer coach April Heinrichs isn't worried about
her team's combined 2-4-2 record this year against Norway and
China, the first two opponents at the Games. More important, she
says, was that the Americans crossed an ocean last month to play
three games in seven days against the Norwegians, Chinese, and
Germans and came out 2-0-1. ``It was a simulated Olympic experience
for us,'' Heinrichs says. ``We felt it was important for us to
advance after the first three games with 6 points and we came away
with 7. We are pleased about that.'' . . . There's only one new
face in the men's lightweight four on the US Olympic rowing team _
Harvard grad Greg Ruckman, who won a gold medal in the lightweight
eight at last year's world regatta. The returnees are Tom Auth,
Marc Schneider, and Paul Teti, whose older brother Mike coaches the
US men's sweep team . . . Nice showing by the US rowing team at the
recent world championships for non-Olympic events in Croatia. The
men's lightweight eight retained its gold medal (with seven new
people in the boat), as did the coxed pair. The men's coxed four
and women's lightweight pair (with Cambridge's Catherine Humblet)
won silvers.

   Could be the end of the Olympic road for volleyball legend Karch
Kiraly, who dislocated his right shoulder spiking on the final
point of a match in Belgium last week and may be done for the year.
Kiraly, who has won three gold medals (two indoors, one beach), was
in good shape to grab the second spot on the US beach team with
Adam Johnson. Even if they end up with enough points to edge Dain
Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana, odds are that Kiraly won't be fit to
compete in Sydney next month. If so, Johnson would have to go with
another partner . . . Tough Olympic draw for the US men's indoor
volleyball squad, which gets the world's top two teams in Italy and
Russia, plus defending bronze medalist Yugoslavia. If the Yanks
beat Argentina, they'll get to the quarterfinals, but a medal will
be a tall order . . . Rough tuneup road for the US men's water polo
team, which went winless at the recent Italian Trophy tournament
without main man Chris Humbert. Then they pulled out of a major
event in Yugoslavia featuring eight of the 12 Olympic qualifiers
after the US State Department advised them that the Americans might
be targets after the US bombing of Kosovo. Half a dozen members of
the 1996 team (Humbert, Gavin Arroyo, Dan Hackett, Chris Oeding,
Wolf Wigo, Kyle Kopp) will be in Sydney. On the squad, too, is
swimmer Brad Schumacher, who won two relay gold medals in Atlanta.
Schumacher also qualified for the swimming trials, but scratched.

   The incredible shrinking Yugoslav team, down from six republics
to two, probably will be down to one after the Sydney Games.
Montenegro wants to compete under its own flag, which leaves only
Serbia under the Yugoslav banner. Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, and
Macedonia all compete under their own names . . . Even though the
US women's field hockey team failed to qualify for Sydney, coach
Tracey Belbin has been rehired through 2004. Since she didn't sign
on until January of last year, Belbin had little time to shape up a
squad that was rebuilding from Atlanta and the federation
understood that . . . Who are James Morrison, Human Nature, Julie
Anthony, John Farnham, Olivia Newton-John, Vanessa Amorosi, and
Tina Arena? They'll be the star entertainers at the opening
ceremonies in Sydney. All of them are Aussies and all except
Newton-John are strangers to most of the planet.

TIGER PHENOMENON NOTHING SHORT OF RUTHIAN

   Mark Calcavecchia was playing a practice round with Tiger Woods
at St. Andrews a few weeks ago when they began talking about major
championships. The British Open, suggested Woods, would be the one
he would win the most.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia looked at Woods with surprise. ``I told him I
thought he'd win the US Open the most,'' and Calcavecchia explained
his reasoning that that tournament demanded more of a player in
terms of being long, straight, deft with the short game, and deadly
with the putter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me, and said, `Hmmm, maybe you're right,' '' said
Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the structure of the pro golf world these days that most
players can only dream of winning one major (David Duval? Colin
Montgomerie? Phil Mickelson? Take your pick for the lead man in the
``Best Player Never to Win a Major'' category) while Woods can
seriously ponder which leg of the grand slam he will win the most.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the midst of something truly remarkable, for Woods is
giving us a glimpse of what it must have been like to have been
around in the days of Babe Ruth. That is not going overboard,
folks; the kid is that good.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, others have gone on major tears before in golf _ Ben Hogan
won eight majors in 11 starts from 1950-53; Arnold Palmer won five
majors in 11 starts from 1960-62 _ but no one ever has blown away
the competition the way Woods has. Even Jack Nicklaus conceded that
he never won touranments by the incredible margins Woods has, a
point that has prompted people to claim that the competition today
isn't what it was in the '60s, '70s, and '80s when the Golden Bear
was on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   That is simply not true, but it's an argument that will rage
forever. However, to involve yourself in it is to chance losing
sight of the phenomenon going on before our eyes _ Woods. He faces
superb talent week in and week out, and his skills are so superior
it is frightening how inferior the opposition looks.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will bring his magic to Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville
this week to try to win his second straight PGA Championship. If he
succeeds, he will join Hogan as the only players to win three legs
of the grand slam in one year (Hogan did it in 1953). It also would
give Woods victories in four of the last five majors and would have
to make you wonder: How in the name of Bobby Jones did Woods not
win the Masters in April?
</P>
<P>
   Some will choose to bemoan the fact nobody can compete with
Woods. I'll choose to marvel at a young man who is taking us on a
most incredible ride. Just like the Babe did many years ago.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A real crowd pleaser
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of a victory that was received with more open
arms than Lorie Kane's last Sunday at the Michelob Light Classic.
After finishing second four times in 1997, once in '98, three times
a year ago, and once in 2000, the personable native of Prince
Edward Island was more than due for her first win. No one had
smiled through more disappointment than Kane, who is arguably the
most popular player in women's golf. When, in her 122d start on the
LPGA Tour, Kane held off a host of challengers, including Karrie
Webb, she was greeted at the 18th hole by many of her colleagues.
This just never happens at pro tour stops when most players are on
to the airport five minutes after that scorecard is signed . . .
Her college season ended in bitter disappointment _ a round of 85
to plunge into her a tie for 34th at the NCAA Championships as her
Duke Blue Devils, the overwhelming favorites, stumbled to a
stunning 14th-place finish _ and there have been signs that more
polish is needed, but Beth Bauer feels otherwise. Thus, the
long-heralded youngster is forgoing her final two years at Duke to
turn pro. Her amateur farewell was not what she would have wanted
as she got ousted in the third round of the US Women's Amateur when
Marcy Newton rattled off six straight birdies to fuel a 3-and-2
triumph. Bauer will make her pro debut at the State Farm Rail
Classic Sept. 2-4, but has already played in four LPGA Tour stops
this year. She missed the cut twice and finished T-35 and T-38 in
the others, and barring a near-miracle, Bauer knows she'll have to
go through Q School . . . While Bauer leaves, Duke coach Dan Brooks
prepares to welcome Leigh Ann Hardin, so the rich stay rich. Hardin
was medalist at last week's US Women's Amateur, though she got
knocked out in the third round . . . Dottie Pepper skipped the du
Maurier this weekend, still bothered by that sore back that forced
her to withdraw from the US Women's Open a few weeks ago. Grace
Park was another WD in Canada, citing a rib injury . . . People
have made a big deal out of Woods's appearance at this weekend's
Buick Open, claiming it is because of an endorsement deal. But why
begrudge Buick its ace, particularly when it holds in its hand
three guys drifting far, far down the marquee list. We're talking
Ben Crenshaw, Chip Beck, and Steve Elkington, all of them big Buick
guys. In the Buick Invitational and the Buick Classic, those three
players combined to miss four cuts, withdraw once, and post
finishes of T-21 and T-63 . . . This weekend, Crenshaw (78-77) and
Beck (76-74) again missed the cut, but Elkington did not play . . .
Woods three times has played the week before a major, 1997, 1998
and this weekend _ all preceding the PGA Championship. But for what
it's worth, the only time he didn't play the week before the PGA
was a year ago, and he won at Medinah . . . Shockingly, Lee Janzen
(73-72 at the Buik) has just one top-10 finish in 17 starts. He's
missed six cuts.

   A round of applause for Eric McPhail of Sandy Burr and Brendan
Hester of Pleasant Valley CC, both of whom last week nailed down
berths in the US Mid-Amateur Championship, one week after securing
spots in the US Amateur. Considering the depth of talent and the
scarcity of spots, it's quite an accomplishment. McPhail survived a
playoff at Olde Barnstable to earn his way to Baltusrol (Aug.
21-27) for the amateur, but made it more easily at Oak Ridge GC,
shooting 70 to finish second and get a pass to The Homestead (Sept.
9-14) for the Mid-Am. As for Hester, it was a pair of extra-inning
victories as he survived playoffs at Salem CC (US Amateur) and Oak
Ridge to make the national tournaments . . . McPhail has something
more immediate on his plate _ the MGA Public Links Championship
Monday and Tuesday. The 1998 winner of this event, McPhail figures
to be in the thick of things at William J. Devine GC, known to all
as Franklin Park, though his competition will no doubt include
former champions Bob Bradley, Jon Fasick, Kevin Murphy, and Kevin
Hanlon, as well as young guns such as Tom Giles (Stow Acres), Kenny
Lewis (Dennis Pines), Michael Carbone (Dennis Pines), Josh Hillman
(CC of Greenfield), and veteran forces such as Bruce Carter
(Cyprian Keyes), Michael Fecteau (Rowley), Carter Fasick (Indian
Meadow), Rick Cunha (Plymouth), and Tom McManus (Cyprian Keyes).
The MGA should be commended for bringing this Public Links
Championship to Franklin Park, a course that is the epitome of
``public.'' The place is a true melting pot, and few courses in the
country can match its history, which includes Willie Campbell's
days as pro, Bobby Jones's visits, Donald Ross's redesign, and
Woods's visit for a junior clinic in 1992.

   One of the players in the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund golf
marathon Wednesday at Stow Acres was Michael Zmetrovich, who
represented Tedesco CC in Marblehead. Ironic that the fund-raiser
was being held opposite the MGA Junior Amateur because 15 years ago
Zmetrovich reigned as winner of that tournament. Back then, he
said, ``I thought for sure I'd play golf the rest of my life,'' a
thought that now makes him laugh. Though it sounds as if he were a
naive young man, Zmetrovich's life these days very much involves
golf _ not as a player on the course, but as one within the Jack
Nicklaus business empire. The Haverhill native is senior vice
president of Golden Bear Club Services with offices in North Palm
Beach, Fla., and in Beverly. In that capacity he is involved with
the running of some of the country's premier golf clubs, from
Muirfield Village in Dublin, Ohio, to the brand new Bear Club in
Palm Beach, to Pasadera, Nicklaus's breathtaking club in Monterey,
Calif., to Vermont National CC, which just opened last year. ``The
Ritz of the golf business,'' is how Zmetrovich, 32, describes the
work he is brought into contact with because of Nicklaus. ``The
best part of the job is being part of a quality organization and
being around these great clubs. You can have the influence on how
to open these clubs and create things that will be there for a long
time.'' Zmetrovich graduated from Florida International University
in 1989 and came in touch with Nicklaus's group while working as an
asset management consultant to a group looking into golf course
properties. ``I was involved in strategic planning. I would help
solve problems and make recommendations. But I never had the
satisfaction of seeing something through start to finish,'' a
problem that has not surfaced since he joined the Nicklaus team
four years ago. As for his week of glory that summer 15 years ago
at Kernwood CC in Salem, Zmetrovich said, ``I remember hitting
balls on the practice tee area the morning of the qualifying rounds
and hitting the ball almost better than I ever had in the past.''
He had finished second in the New England Junior Amateur a few
weeks earlier, but at Kernwood he made it to the top. Proving that
champions never really leave the game, Zmetrovich 15 years later
was out playing 120 holes to help a charitable effort . . . Another
of the hardy souls who took part in the Ouimet fund-raiser was
Harry Rose, the assistant pro at Needham GC. Of course, marathons
are nothing new to the 46-year-old Rose; he has run 18 marathons
throughout the country. Rose, one time, needed just 19 minutes to
play nine holes at Needham GC . . . The official tally for the
Ouimet fund-raiser was $230,000 . . . Among those who failed to get
through US Amateur qualifiers in our area were a pair of Division 1
golf coaches _ Buddy Alexander of the University of Florida (at
Salem CC), and Mike Moraghan of the University of Virginia (at
Crestview CC) . . . Finally, what have our local golfers been
eating (and can I get some, too?), because they have defied the
laws of reality. We are told that the odds of making two
holes-in-one in the same round are astronomical, something like
70,000,000-1, yet it has happened twice within a three-week span.
First, Christine Barrie made a pair of aces at her home club, The
International in Bolton, and now Bill Pierce has done the
near-impossible. Playing at Wollaston GC in Milton during a
fund-raiser for the Boston College Club, Pierce last Wednesday aced
the sixth hole, then did it again at the 12th hole.

AMERICAONE IS ON COURSE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Cayard is a pragmatic man.
</P>
<P>
   He does not sail in the America's Cup unless he has a decent
shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
   He does not jump into competition without a thorough analysis of
his strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks he may be good enough to beat one of the new
billionaires, but not four of them.
</P>
<P>
   So, the worst kept secret of Cup 2003 _ Cayard will join his
AmericaOne sailing syndicate with Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison
_ has come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Cayard announced Ellison bought the assets of the
2000 AmericaOne syndicate, forming a new syndicate combining the
sailing prowess of AmericaOne with the bottomless cash of Ellison,
who is a newly impassioned enthusiast of sailboat racing.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison joins three other such campaigns around the world _
Italy's Patrizio Bertelli, Switzerland's Ernesto Bertarelli, and
Seattle's Craig McCaw _ that have the advantage of starting without
financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
   More important to them, perhaps, than the $80 million bottom
line, is the upfront money that assures them a place in the
professional sailor/designer free agent market the Cup has
developed into.
</P>
<P>
   The other known player, at this point, is the New York Yacht
Club, which, just as it seemed resigned to sit out 2003, announced
a deal with Team Dennis Conner after two previous attempts over the
past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Conner brings his own management skills and a sailing team that,
on a shoestring budget in Auckland, made a strong run at the
semifinals with Newport's Ken Read at the helm and player-coach Tom
Whidden calling tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The exact proportions of New York's budget are unknown, but far
from the $80 million of the big four. Still in the rumor mill is
talk that Jim Clark (Netscape) and even Bill Gates _ both a
presence in Auckland _ are considering a dive into America's Cup
waters.
</P>
<P>
   But what is clear as time ticks away is that there is more money
out there than experienced Cup sailing talent, and that most of the
latter is already committed. New Zealand, ravaged by Bertarelli's
Swiss entry, which snapped up Russell Coutts and Brad Butterworth,
is going through the motions of trying to keep what remains of its
once powerhouse team by holding a national fund-raising drive to
pay sailors signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard does not blame Coutts and Butterworth for jumping ship.
``Russell Coutts is not only a two-time America's Cup winner, he
was an Olympic gold medalist in Finn Class,'' said Cayard. ``He's a
very accomplished sailor. And he probably was earning a tenth of
what (Italian skipper) Francesco deAngelis got paid last time. So
now New Zealand sees it needs to compete with the billionaire
challengers. On the other hand, with Coutts and Butterworth in
Switzerland, now the Swiss have a potentially very potent team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard thinks the broadening of the talent base and the infusion
of money only improves the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '20s and '30s, the Vanderbilt, Sopwith, Lipton sagas
were common to the event,'' said Cayard. ``The America's Cup has
always taken men of wealth to put it together. They were
industrialists, and now the leaders of high-tech have the capital
to play this game. It suits them because it is a high-tech game.
There may be fewer challengers (in 2003) than last time, but this
is the kind of thing great stories are made of. It will be
incredibly exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cayard announcement, made from his San Francisco compound,
throws the next Cup into two distinct tiers: at least four teams
are freed from constant fund-raising; and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to be realistic,'' said Cayard, noting that selling
``our child (AmericaOne)'' was a tough choice. ``But I feel good
about what we have done to find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem seeking that solution, said Cayard, is that
AmericaOne, engaged in the drag of constant fund-raising, would
have a budget of around $30 million, not enough to compete with the
super syndicates. So the choices were to fold AmericaOne, let the
time pass until they were out of options, or make a proactive move.
The Ellison deal became a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard would not disclose what Ellison paid for his syndicate,
but said the deal was good for both sides. ``AmericaOne has a lot
to offer anyone who would want to enter the America's Cup. We have
two great boats, a lot of good energy that went into them. The base
in New Zealand is a work of art. So I think we had a great platform
to offer the (Ellison) team, and we were fairly compensated for all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard's role in the new syndicate is still at question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally evaluating what I want to do. Some days I wake
up and say it's a lot of hard work to be the best skipper in the
world, and I want to spend time with my family. So I'm not going to
take a front-line position on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then there are other days I go to the gym and lift more
weight than I ever lited before, and say `Hell, I'm only 41 years
old. I can do it. I'm going to dedicate the time to be the best
sailor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With designs due in November, Cayard noted that Prada and the
new Ellison teams will have the early advantage, since both
syndicates already have proven designs to work from.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, so does Team New Zealand, which at this point may
still be their trump card.

PLAYERS APPEAR TIRED OF THIS SHOW

<P>
   You're not supposed to judge a man by the clothes he wears, but
in Arizona, you could lose your job for telling another man how to
wear his socks.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter, who signed a seven-year, $7-million deal with
the Arizona Diamondbacks two years before the D-Backs even started
playing, was under fire last week because his players reportedly
are fed up with his rule-for-every-occasion approach. That includes
a stipulation that the D-Backs wear their socks with the ``A''
facing up.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's need for control extends to off-field stuff, too,
according to the East Valley Tribune, the Arizona newspaper that
reported Showalter ordered video scoreboard operators to stop
showing the American League's home run leaders because former
Diamondback Tony Batista was on the list and that reflected badly
on the club.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic columnist Pedro Gomez created the latest furor
with a column last Tuesday. ``They can't wait around for Showalter
and his paranoid personality to change his ways,'' Gomez said.
``Ownership needs to seize the moment while there's still a moment
to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy could have ended there, but Arizona players did
little publicly to shoot down the column, and D-Backs boss Jerry
Colangelo, while saying he thought Showalter was doing a ``very
good job,'' left himself some wiggle room to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt there were changes that needed to be made, I would
have done it,'' Colangelo told reporters. ``My feelings are kept to
myself and I respond when I feel it's necessary to respond, one way
or another. And right now, I'd rather just concentrate on this team
playing good baseball, getting healthy, and winning games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A question has been raised. Some might come to a conclusion or
opinion. But from my standpoint, I don't need any advice from
anyone. I've been around too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, despite the acquisition of Curt Schilling to
pair with Randy Johnson as two 300-strikeout men at the top of
their rotation, have barely played .500 baseball over the last
couple of months. They haven't gotten the production they received
last year from veterans Matt Williams and Jay Bell, but it appears
to go deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter, a winner with the Yankees until he clashed one too
many times with George Steinbrenner, is a demanding boss who can
irk friend and foe alike. No one said a word last season when the
D-Backs won 100 games in just their second year of existence, but
with the club falling behind the Giants in the NL West, his style
is coming under increasing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter is one of the most meticulously prepared managers in
the game, one who is Joe Kerrigan-like in his devotion to studying
charts and tendencies and the like. His people skills, however,
have always been questioned, much like Dan Duquette in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this: The Giants, D-Backs, and Dodgers are running 1, 2,
3, in the West, and all three teams could have new managers next
season. The Giants want to keep Dusty Baker, but he is a free agent
after the season and could be in great demand. Showalter is under
the gun, and Davey Johnson's bosses at Fox are not satisfied with
the way the Dodgers have hovered just over the .500 mark.

   Checking out
</P>
<P>
   Rico Brogna still enjoys coaching basketball as much as ever,
but the Watertown (Conn.) High School freshman coach has put his
career on hold for a couple of years so that he can spend more time
with his daughter, Alexa, who turns 3 in October. Brogna coached
seven years at Watertown. ``I had a 12-5 record my last year,''
Brogna said with a smile. ``I guess I wanted to go out on a winning
note.'' Brogna said he also has written three or four football
playbooks for use by high school teams . . . Rod Beck, on the huge
turnover in the Sox clubhouse: ``There are a lot of veteran dudes
that I crossed paths with at some point. It only takes a couple of
minutes to remember a couple of at-bats I had against 'em. I know
when I first came up I used to think it was weird that big Don
Robinson would be standing next to the batting cage in every city
we played, talking to guys. I used to think, `How the hell does he
know all those guys?' Now I know. You just have to be around long
enough.'' How does the constant turnover affect clubhouse
chemistry? ``Chemistry comes in a lot of forms,'' Beck said. ``As a
player, I've been asked maybe 100 times to describe what it is. It
changes from clubhouse to clubhouse, and can change from year to
year. I can't put my finger on the word to describe it. It's not
like if you have X and Y you have clubhouse chemistry. It has a lot
to do with winning. Winning solves a lot of problems. Win a few
games, a team starts to jell.'' . . . When Beck was with the
Giants, he played with Deion Sanders, now a full-time football
player with the Washington Redskins. ``I genuinely liked and
respected Deion. He once told me he could fall out of bed and cover
a guy in football, but he had to work at this. And he did. Every
day I'd be on my way to the bullpen and Deion would be in front of
a mirror, working on his swing. He took balls off the bat in
batting practice in the outfield, and he worked on his base
running. You have to respect someone who respects the game like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Not worth it
</P>
<P>
   Count Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis among those who are
concerned about the use of protein and muscle-enhancing
supplements, not to mention the use of illegal steroids.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed at the large number of players on the disabled list
as evidence that some players are breaking down because of the use
of supplements. ``Guys are adding 15 to 20 pounds on frames that
just weren't made for it,'' he said. ``That's why you see so many
hamstring and other muscle pulls. You look at the number of games
we play, and the fact that we're traveling more than ever, the body
breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use any of that stuff. I make my living this way, the
way that I am. I'm not all of a sudden going to hit 20 home runs. I
try to keep my weight stable, get my rest and will continue to play
as long as my legs are good.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of the supplements, Lewis believes, stems in
part from the vast rewards available to athletes at an increasingly
younger age. ``You look at Venus Williams in tennis, who is barely
20 years old, Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, Darius Miles. You can
beome a millionaire before you're 20. You're willing to take risks
(with your body).''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, on how baseball is changing: ``This is just my opinion,
but we're seeing more and more of the same player. The guy who hits
20 home runs and drives in 80 to 100 runs, but his flip side is he
doesn't know how to bunt, he can't hit and run, and stealing a base
has become almost obsolete. You don't have the Willie McGee type
player anymore. To me, it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cox using mirrors?
</P>
<P>
   One National League general manager on the Atlanta Braves,
bidding for their ninth straight division title: ``For the last
three years, we, like everybody else, have said the Braves are
vulnerable to this and that. But this year, Bobby Cox has had no
closer, his team has really been banged up, they're not
overpowering offensively, and they're still the best team in our
league. I think Bobby Cox has done his best job ever of managing.
He's done an amazing job. He gets slammed when the Braves don't win
the World Series, but I think he's one of the best.'' . . . Carl
Everett's agent, Larry Reynolds, was successful in persuading Frank
Robinson that his client did not head-butt umpire Ronald Kulpa. In
1990, when Roger Clemens was ejected from Game 4 of the American
League Championship Series against the Oakland A's for his run-in
with umpire Gerry Cooney, the lawyers in charge of his appeal were
prepared to use a deaf woman from the New York Institute of the
Deaf who was an expert in lip reading to testify on Clemens's
behalf. The woman specialized in lip reading from videotape, and
had been used in the movie industry to recreate scripts. She was
prepared to tesify with ``100 percent certainty,'' according to one
source, that what Cooney claimed Clemens yelled at him, Clemens
didn't say, and that Clemens was 99 percent precise in his version
of what he said. But commissioner Fay Vincent refused to hear an
appeal after then-AL president Bobby Brown gave the Rocket a
five-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That didn't take long
</P>
<P>
   Did you notice that Jeff Frye is already out of the Rockies'
starting lineup? Manager Buddy Bell has elected to go with Todd
Walker, picked up from the Twins, with Frye limited to pinch hiting
. . . Left off the list of home runs hit to end marathon games: On
June 24, 1962, Jack Reed hit a two-out home run in the 22d inning
to end the longest game in Yankees history, a 9-7 win at Detroit.
Reed, a seldom-used backup outfielder, played for the Yankees from
1961-63, appearing in 222 games. In 129 big-league at-bats, that
was his only home run. Thanks to reader Bob Interato for that gem .
. . Former Sox pitcher Earl Wilson has been named CEO of the
Baseball Assistance Team (BAT), the organization founded to help
out former players in need. Wilson succeeds Joe Garagiola . . .
Jimy Williams makes it a rule not to talk about his family _ it's a
privacy issue for him _ but kudos go to his daughter, Monica, who
swam in the US Olympic trials after being named team MVP at Texas
A&AMP;M in a vote by her teammates. Monica Williams swam the
second-fastest time in school history in the 200 freestyle and
ranks third on A&AMP;M's all-time list in the 100 freestyle . . . Bell
on Brian Rose, after the former Sox righthander won his first start
for the Rockies, allowing a run in six innings: ``I was impressed
with his command more than anything, and his ability to make big
pitches when he needed them. Brian is a competitor. He throws
strikes. He's got an idea what he's doing.'' . . . The Giants'
starting rotation seems set for the foreseeable future after they
signed lefthander Kirk Rueter to a three-year, $15.6 million deal
that included a $3.35 million signing bonus. Rueter, eligible for
free agency after the season, almost certainly could have commanded
more on the open market _ he's 29 and had won 44 games in the three
seasons prior to this one _ but he said he wanted to stay with the
Giants. He is the senior member of a collection of young guns that
includes Livan Hernandez, 25; Russ Ortiz, 26; Shawn Estes, 27; and
Joe Nathan, 25. Injuries can wreck the best-laid plans, of course,
but it would seem the Giants are in a position to be competitive
for some time to come . . . Chipper Jones has yet to sign a new
deal reported to be for six years and $90 million, but Sammy Sosa
is already salivating about what it means for him. Sosa, who now
says he wants to finish his career with the Cubs, still aims to be
the game's highest-paid player, though it's debatable whether the
Tribune Company will give Sosa more than the $15 million annual
average of Jones's contract, which reportedly will also include two
option years. ``My value is going to go up, seeing the way they
took care of Chipper,'' Sosa said . . . After beating the Cubs
Friday, the Reds have gone 115 games without being shut out this
season. The only team to go an entire season without being blanked
is the 1932 Yankees, the team for which Babe Ruth supposedly called
his shot in the World Series against the Cubs . . . Jones's Atlanta
teammate, Greg Maddux, said he struggled the first year after he
signed a big contract with the Cubs. ``After a while,'' he told
Bill Zack of the Morris News Service, ``you start to realize the
money doesn't change the player. The only difference is you can buy
two of everything instead of one.'' . . . Are the White Sox hearing
footsteps? They were 14-14 since the All-Star break entering play
Saturday. Rocky Biddle Thursday became the fourth White Sox pitcher
to make his big-league debut since July 4, joining Jon Garland,
Mark Buehrle and Lorenzo Barcelo. Little wonder manager Jerry
Manuel is hoping the White Sox pick up another veteran pitcher . .
. Ex-Sox righthander Pat Rapp could be available. The Rapper has
won just three of his last 18 starts and is expected to be traded
or released by the Orioles . . . Another Bird in free fall is
Albert Belle, who has hit just three home runs in his last 37 games
and was 12 for his last 68 entering the weekend. Belle has a
painful hip injury, but it hasn't been bad enough for manager Mike
Hargrove to yank his slugger out of the lineup . . . Derek Bell,
Everett's Tampa buddy, was fined the other day by Mets manager
Bobby Valentine for showing up at 5:40 p.m. for a 7 o'clock game.
``I got caught in traffic and there was nothing I could do about
it,'' said Bell, who last month ran in from right field while
Everett was throwing his nutty . . . Everett, who was a perpetual
late arrival all season, was among the early birds all last week.
One veteran player on another club suggested it was unfair to
single out Everett for his tardiness. ``Nowadays, stars push the
rules moreso than they used to,'' the player said. ``But rules are
rules. Why should Manny Alexander be on time when Pedro (Martinez)
and Carl Everett are not. That shows a lack of respect for
teammates. From what I hear, Jimy Williams has three rules: Be on
time. Play hard. Dress code on the road. That's it. What's so hard
about that?'' Why doesn't Nomar Garciaparra stretch the rules?
``Nomar has respect for his teammates and the game,'' the player
said . . . The Yankees, with Roger Clemens poised to sign a
reported extension for three years and $30 million, have Clemens,
Denny Neagle, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez under their
control for the next three seasons . . . The Phillies have gotten
rid of five of the nine players in their Opening Day lineup:
pitcher Andy Ashby, first baseman Rico Brogna, second baseman
Mickey Morandini, shortstop Desi Relaford, and outfielder Ron Gant.
They also dumped ace Schilling. Who says the Phils are in
rebuilding mode?

FAMILY CARRIES ON MAN'S DREAM OF PEACH ORCHARD CROP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A breeze doesn't blow in a peach orchard.
</P>
<P>
   The trees seal off the wind like a long, green oven door.
Inside, leaves don't move. Peaches hang still. Sweat rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Wall picks until a half-bushel box is full, then reaches
for another. Her 12-year-old son and another boy pick other trees.
</P>
<P>
   It's midafternoon in this orchard southeast of Kansas City.
They've been at it since early morning. Horseflies buzz around
them. Grasshoppers fly past their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Wall stops, takes off her glasses and uses her shirt to
wipe sweat from her face. She doesn't dare look down the row. For
there waits her husband's dream.
</P>
<P>
   This is the summer his peaches came.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 trees, peaches thick as ornaments on Christmas
trees at Macy's. Prettier even. Red and gold, like balls of sunset.
</P>
<P>
   And Cheryl Wall, 45, is determined to pick them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part,'' she said, ``is knowing he will never see
any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion Wall died unexpectedly April 1 at age 55, leaving his
wife and son to tend the orchard. All told: 3,200 peach, apple,
pear, cherry and plum trees. And some grape vines.
</P>
<P>
   They could have moved back to the city. Cheryl Wall sure didn't
know how to run an orchard. Curtis, her son, was only a
sixth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   But they're learning. Picking, pruning and mowing. Twelve hours
most days. Carrying boxes, fighting bugs and wiping sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl does it for her husband, a man she described as being
hardworking, giving and with a laugh that came from his toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel him when I'm out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while many 12-year-olds spend summer days at the pool or
watching MTV, Curtis works alongside his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make this orchard work...for my dad.'' Nurturing a
dream
</P>
<P>
   They came from Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Wall worked construction there. Cheryl was a surgical
scrub nurse.
</P>
<P>
   But after 20 years of life in the city, they had a calling for
the country. During a 1994 visit to relatives in Missouri, they
happened upon a farm for sale, east of Garden City just across the
Cass County line into Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   They fixed up the place and started raising cattle. Later, came
the idea for the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it had always been his dream,'' Cheryl said.
</P>
<P>
   Marion kept his old job, commuting to Oklahoma City and
returning home on weekends to catch up with farm work.
</P>
<P>
   He was a spontaneous sort. One day, when he and Cheryl decided
the fireplace made the house too dark and a large window would be
better, Marion grabbed a 20-pound sledge and started pounding away.
</P>
<P>
   Life was good. The farm was beautiful. The trees were growing.
Marion and Cheryl had morning coffee in the gazebo that sits in the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Shandra, was married in that gazebo. Neighbors
came to the wedding in everything from overalls to suits. Marion
smoked ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came April 1 this year, a Saturday. Marion and Cheryl ran
errands that morning. They went to the feed store. Later, in what
would seem a quirk of fate, friends started dropping by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everybody he knew was coming to visit,'' Cheryl
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Marion was burning a brush pile. He came to the
house and coughed a cough Cheryl had never heard the likes of. He
said he didn't feel good. He was ashen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm hurts,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in the truck,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The white Ford pickup flew down gravel roads and blacktops
toward the hospital in Harrisonville. As always, he gave her
pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful now, you know that cow's always in the road along
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch for that cop that sits up there,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you just relax?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles farther, she looked over and knew he was gone. She
pulled into a driveway and yelled for help. Folks came out and
helped Cheryl pull Marion out of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack had killed her husband of 18 years, a man who had
never shown a sign of heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just worked himself to death,'' Cheryl says now.
``Driving back and forth to Oklahoma, cramming in all the work he
did here on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't grieve long. There wasn't time. Marion's peaches were
coming, and they would have to be her income. She had spraying to
do and trees to prune.
</P>
<P>
   But first, she had to learn how. She went to a longtime peach
grower and told him of her plans to run the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you want to do this?'' Bill Baxter, 73, asked.
</P>
<P>
   He knew how much work an orchard was _ and he had only 350
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Marion's dream,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But is it your dream?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   She just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, who runs a retail stand along Missouri 7 in Cass County,
gave her a crash course. He told her what sprays to use and when to
use them, how to prune and how to tell when the peaches were ready
to pick.
</P>
<P>
   Friends came to help in the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, she said. In a big city where you live on a crowded
block, you don't have that many close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``But out here, where nobody lives within a mile of you, friends
come from all over to help,'' Cheryl said.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, she hopes to go to the house where her husband died and
thank the people who tried to help her that day. But she can't _
not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``God will tell me when it's time.'' `The mominator'
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck!'' Curtis yells.
</P>
<P>
   And they all duck just as the branch whips above their heads. A
little six-wheeler truck is zipping between rows of peach trees.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, riding in the back, frowns and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta start prunin','' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His 13-year-old friend, Josh Hastings, rides beside him _
helping, as always, without pay. Booker, an Australian shepherd,
runs alongside. Cheryl, whom the boys call the ``mominator,'' is
driving the six-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   It's early afternoon. The boys haven't had lunch yet, but a
truck is coming at 3:30 p.m. to pick up 27 boxes of peaches. Later,
she will need to deliver 24 boxes to Bill Baxter's stand.
</P>
<P>
   Just another day in the orchard.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl is up around daybreak and not back into the house 'til 9
p.m. Then there's cooking and cleaning and laundry to do.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Scott, a wholesaler who buys from Cheryl, calls her the
workingest woman he's ever seen in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most wives in her place would have sold this place and moved
to town in a minute,'' Scott said. ``There ain't no quit in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl puts it this way: ``It doesn't get done if you just think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She won't hire help. Not until she learns what she's doing.
Anyway, she feels a need to do it herself this summer.
</P>
<P>
   They started harvest July 8 and are now more than halfway done.
</P>
<P>
   The days are long for Curtis, but he knows what's at stake. He
was 6 when he helped his father plant the trees, ``shoveling dirt
and sweatin' like a pack mule.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, it seems that just about the time they get the
orchard mowed and the trees tended, it's time to do both again.
</P>
<P>
   But he still finds time to fish and hunt, and not just for
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mom the more wild game I bring back, the less we
have to go the grocery store,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl calls this her learning year. Next year will be easier.
She plans on turning her barn into a retail stand.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend, Pam Huff, thinks Cheryl is holding up, though
maybe the work is a way of putting off the grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives in that orchard...the peaches are what keeps her
going,'' Huff said.
</P>
<P>
   And, to fulfill her husband's dream, Cheryl Wall has been going
as hard as she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a peach falls to the ground, it may just have to lay there
because I've done the best I can do,'' she said this week as she
filled her pickup with boxes overflowing with Biscos and Summer
Pearls.
</P>
<P>
   It is a great summer for peaches.
</P>
<P>
   It is the summer Marion Wall had waited for.

 VIETNAMESE IN aMERICA GATHER AT CARTHAGE FOR MARIAN DAYS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTHAGE, Mo. _ Dien Nguyen could not find peace in Vietnam,
even after the war ended, even after his family's meals were no
longer interrupted by explosions and dashes for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious Communists made it impossible for Nguyen to
profess his Catholic faith without fear of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Raytown man and his countrymen find such joy in
Marian Days, a four-day celebration that has brought about 50,000
Vietnamese Catholics from around the world to this small Ozarks
town. Marian Days began Thursday and will wrap up on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our faith is something we carry in here,'' Nguyen said,
pointing to his heart. ``We feel fortunate to be able to express
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after the war ended, Vietnamese Catholics
continue to thrive in this unlikely haven. Their seminary, the
Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix, has organized Marian Days
since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   At Marian Days, lively pop music blares from tents _ most of the
visitors will camp on the 30-acre seminary grounds. Teen-agers whiz
by on skateboards while families share tea with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   A choir's songs echo on the main square. Several dozen priests
hear confessions in a park dotted with trees. In the chapel,
worshipers solemnly light candles to honor loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Frivolity and faith emanate from every corner of this sprawling
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants say adversity has strengthened that faith,
since the days when it seemed bombs were all the heavens had to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the main plaza, the congregation erected a massive statue of
the Virgin Mary as patron of refugees. The baby Jesus rests on her
shoulder. A Vietnamese child reaches for her waist. Mary draws him
in with her hand. Fleeing to new land
</P>
<P>
   ``The church in Vietnam wrote her history with her own blood,''
reads a caption at a campus center that honors Vietnamese martyrs.
The Co-Redemptrix community shared that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   When Saigon fell, about 185 community members piled into boats
and sailed east. An American cargo ship picked them up and, after a
time, authorities took them to Fort Chafee, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop of the Springfield-Cape Girardeau diocese heard of
their plight and gave them an unused seminary in Carthage. After
faltering initially, the congregation has rebounded to more than
200 priests and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Father Anthony McGuire of the National Catholic Bishops'
Conference, who oversees pastoral care for migrants and refugees,
compares the community to the Poles, who suffered under Nazi and
Communist oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tends to draw people together. You see that in
Carthage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Thomas Dien puts it this way: ``These are people who
lived a hard life. They need something to lean on. They may have
come with no job, no money. So they lean on their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation started Marian Days to thank Mary for her
protection. About 1,700 attended the inaugural event. Early
accounts describe picketing and taunts from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Dien says some neighbors have moved, in part, to avoid the
hubbub of the festival. Several complain of traffic. Some
homeowners blanket their front yards with bright red ``Keep Out''
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Unease grew in 1995 when a Louisiana teen-ager was arrested in
Joplin for the gang-related shooting of another event participant.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the event has become part of the
town's heritage, like the Civil War battlefield nearby. Carthage
has created a citywide holiday, Vietnamese Day, even though the
number of Vietnamese residents still is relatively small.
Townspeople visit to sample the gantlet of food tents. Several
neighbors even open their front yards for camping.
</P>
<P>
   As jobs in poultry plants and agriculture bring a stream of
immigrants from Mexico and southeast Asia, some say Carthage could
be a preview of the changing face of southwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 to 1997, the Vietnamese population in America
quadrupled to more than 1 million. The numbers also are growing in
Missouri _ the 1990 census estimated 3,870 Vietnamese statewide,
25th highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lesson to be learned from Carthage,'' McGuire said.
``If you're open to it, these people are a gift. The changes are
something that enrich your life, rather than hold you back.''
Family rifts
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ozarks and Vietnam are worlds apart, participants
say the event also addresses rifts within the Vietnamese community.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Vietnam is a country of contrasts, a crossroads of
ancient traditions and modern influences. Many Vietnamese still are
divided by ideology, geography or religion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 80 million residents are Buddhist, with Catholics
comprising only about 10 percent of the population. Some, including
the government, consider Catholicism a religion of
``superstitions.''
</P>
<P>
   For those in the United States, Marian Days has become a
unifying cultural force.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors create small bazaars to sell CDs, religious icons and
imported knicknacks. Churches sell sandwiches, entrees and
pastries. Musicians play traditional and modern tunes.
</P>
<P>
   An Le of Joplin said only about a third of the 250 event
participants from his hometown are Catholic. The rest are Buddhist
or of other religions. He said the event highlights their
similarities, not their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have the same struggles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And organizers are amazed at how Marian Days bridges the gap
between first-generation Vietnamese and their U.S.-born children.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is clear. A middle-aged woman in a traditional gown
shares sidewalk space with a tattooed teen wearing a Kobe Bryant
basketball jersey. She converses in Vietnamese, he in English
slang.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers tailor events to specific groups: the elderly,
families and youth. A poster with teen idol Christina Aguilera
advertised Friday night's ``holy rave,'' a dance party starting at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's usually a generation gap in Vietnamese families,''
Dien said. ``This gives them some family time, camping together,
praying together. They can get away from the TV, the jobs and all
the distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bilingual Masses are at the event's core.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening ceremony, Bishop John Leibrecht of the
Springfield-Cape Girardeau diocese told worshipers of how God
helped Moses and his people survive the grueling desert journey to
the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is always with us,'' Leibrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen already knows that. The Raytown man vividly recalls his
own perilous six-day journey on a shrimp boat with 50 other
refugees crossing the South China Sea from Vietnam to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we knew is that we were the bait of the sharks. We only
had one place to turn,'' he said. ``That's why people are here
today, to give thanks to God. It's our faith that got us through
all of this.''

MONICA LEWINSKY'S SHADOW HANGS OVER CONVENTION &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As bomb-sniffing dogs and security officers combed
the Democratic National Convention hall, party leaders on Saturday
dismissed as ``bizarre'' a contention by Republican candidate
George W. Bush that Vice President Al Gore should repudiate
President Clinton for his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to counter Bush's effort to revive the Lewinsky
matter, Democratic chairman Edward G. Rendell insisted the Nov. 7
election is about the future, not the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was bizarre,'' Rendell told reporters, referring
to Bush's comments. ``These guys want this election to be about
Monica Lewinsky. Well, we have news for them. The American people
are not going to ... risk the quality of life of their families for
Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said Gore ``has made it clear that he in no way
sanctioned the president, that he was disappointed in the
president. That's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush told reporters that Gore should forcefully
condemn Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky, an affair that led to the
president's impeachment for obstructing justice and near-removal
from office last year. Clinton will speak Monday night in his last
convention as president and is expected to stress the Clinton-Gore
record on the economy, crime and welfare. He also is expected to
respond to claims by Bush and GOP vice presidential nominee Dick
Cheney that Clinton and Gore squandered eight years in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell confirmed that the timing of Clinton's convention speech
had been switched from Tuesday to Monday to put more distance
between the president and the convention's grand finale _ Gore's
acceptance speech on Thursday night. Clinton ``absolutely
understood,'' the need to give Gore the spotlight, Rendell said.
Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton plan to depart
Tuesday for a symbolic handoff to Gore at a campaign stop in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said Clinton will talk about his accomplishments in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to remind this country ... where we were on
Jan. 1, 1993 (just before Clinton took office) and where we've come
today,'' Rendell said. ``On all the things important to Americans,
we've come light years _ and it's no accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell also said it was likely that Clinton will touch on the
Lewinsky scandal and handle it in much the same manner as he did
earlier this week at a meeting of ministers outside Chicago.
Clinton said then that ``surely, no fair-minded person would blame
(Gore) for the mistakes I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic national co-chair Joseph Andrew took a shot the
Republican convention in Philadelphia earlier this month. ``They
had an `illusion of inclusion' convention where you saw a lot of
pretty pictures,'' Andrew said. ``We're having a convention based
on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Democratic confab, polls showed Bush
continuing to lead Gore. Four surveys, including three that focused
on registered voters, showed Bush's margin over Gore ranging from 9
percentage points in a Newsweek survey to 14 percentage points in a
survey for Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making a claim we're not behind,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell was more blunt. ``Polls are worthless,'' he said, adding
they are ``snapshots'' of an electorate in which no one is focusing
on the election.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show voters ``care about character and
leadership,'' Andrew said, they also show ``they care about
character and leadership on the issues they think are most
important. They don't just want a leader. They want a leader on the
issues they think are (important) to them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Communicating Gore's leadership qualities on those issues is
``our job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore and Bush clashed on the campaign trail over the
future of environmental cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore visited the Springdale, Pa., home of Rachel Carson, author
of the ``Silent Spring'' that helped spawn the environmental
movement, to underscore his pledge to fight corporate polluters and
the oil industry to clean the nation's air and water and reduce
dependence on foreign oil with energy-efficient vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made great strides,'' Gore declared, ``but I'm here to
tell you, you ain't seen nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Clinton-Gore administration had orchestrated the
cleanup of 500 toxic waste sites in the last seven years _ three
times as many as during the 12 years of the Reagan-Bush
presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the Pittsburgh airport by motorcade, Gore
repeatedly bounded out of his armor-plated limousine into adoring
crowds. At one impromptu stop, Gore asked the groom's permission
and offered a newly-married bride a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Bush's campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett
challenged the Clinton-Gore administration's ``failure'' on toxic
waste cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said the so-called Superfund toxic waste site cleanup
program ``has benefited trial lawyers more than the environment,''
adding that despite more than $30 billion in federal spending it
still takes an average of eight years to clean up a site.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid charges from the Gore camp that he was hogging the
limelight, Clinton had a low-profile Saturday, cancelling a series
of scheduled television interviews and choosing to play golf
instead with Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican, and
Clinton's chummy campaign finance whiz, Terry McAuliffe. Clinton
was scheduled to join his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Saturday
night for a fund-raising concert and tribute to his presidency that
was designed to raise as much as $4 million for the first lady's
New York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to her husband, who ducked the limelight, Mrs.
Clinton stepped eagerly forward, telling the Associated Press in an
interview that she had shouldered a substantive role at the White
House framing legislation for Clinton-Gore administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people to know that because if someone is going to
claim I sat around eating bonbons for the last five or six years, I
think it's only fair that the truth come out,'' Clinton said. Her
opponent in the race to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., has accused Clinton of
doing nothing for New York as first lady. Clinton said her
prime-time nationally televised address at the Democratic
convention on Monday night would focus on efforts to help America's
children ``to try to give every child a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's vice presidential running mates were in the news
for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes defended the $20 million
stock paying that the energy services firm Halliburton Corp., is
paying GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney. ``The American
people should be pleased they have a vice presidential nominee who
has been successful in business,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton's board voted to reverse contract language with
Cheney that had called for him to forego stock options if he left
his job at the Dallas-based firm before age 62. Cheney is 59.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lieberman made good on his pledge to continue
honoring the Orthodox Jewish Sabbath on Saturday by ceasing all
work. Lieberman, wearing a prayer shawl and a yarmulke on his head,
attended services in Reassignment, D.C., with his wife, Hadassah.
The couple's rabbi, Barry Freundel, urged the Liebermans' fellow
congregants not to act ``triumphant'' as a result of Lieberman's
selection as the first American Jew on a major party ticket. ``This
is a test case,'' Freundel said. ``We could squander this
opportunity.''

DEMOCRATIC LEADERS APPLAUD MOVE OF FUND-RAISER AWAY FROM PLAYBOY
PALACE &HT;    By JUDY HOLLAND
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democratic leaders applauded Rep. Loretta Sanchez
Saturday for canceling her plans to hold a fund-raiser for Hispanic
politicians at the Playboy Mansion. Her retreat followed weeks of
pressure from party officials and Catholic and Latino leaders, who
said that such an event there would hurt Vice President Al Gore's
efforts to paint his candidacy as pro-family.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday party leaders warned Sanchez that unless she gave
up the Hugh Hefner pleasure palace near here, they would revoke the
California congresswomen's speaking slot at next week's Democratic
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 40, finally caved in Friday and announced she was
moving the fund-raiser to B.B. King's Blues Club at Universal
Studios' CityWalk, a touristy street of restaurants and shops. In
return, Democratic leaders restored her speaking slot for this
Thursday and canceled their threats to consider ousting her as the
highest ranking woman in the Democratic Party. Sanchez is co-chair
of the Democratic National Committee, along with Detroit Mayor
Dennis Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign chairman, William Daley, said Saturday that he
would never go to the Playboy Mansion and that hosting an event at
the site of bacchanalian revelry where scantily clad women are
pursued by pajama-wearing suitors would ``send the wrong message''
about Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that she changed her mind,'' Daley said on CNN.
``There were many people in the Democratic Party who thought that
that location sent the wrong signal to Democrats and to America
about what the Democratic Party is all about. It's a location that
is used often for chaity events but (it) has also historically been
used for things that don't exactly highlight women.''
</P>
<P>
   Party Chairman Joe Andrew said on NBC that ``we're very happy to
have (Sanchez) back and to continue our work to make sure that all
voters, particularly Latino voters, know this is their party.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew dismissed Republican charges that Democrats are
hypocritical in accepting about $60,000 from Playboy for Democratic
federal campaigns since 1991 while condemning Sanchez for wanting
to hold her fund-raiser at the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people give us money, they're endorsing our cause, our
vision, our candidates, not the other way around,'' Andrew told
reporters. ``That is an important distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine, had also called Gore
and other party leaders hypocrites for attacking the mansion while
soliciting campaign contributions from Playboy executives.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, however, said that since Sanchez is a top party oficial,
the party should have some say about where she chooses to hold
fund-raisers. ``It's location, location, location here as well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   DNC general chairman Edward G. Rendell, said that if Sanchez had
not been a high-ranking party official, they wouldn't have become
involved. ``Had she been doing this on her own as a congresswoman,
it might have been a wholly different scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who will formally accept his party's nomination for
president Thursday at the convention, had also pressed for
relocation of the benefit for Sanchez's political action committee,
Hispanic Unity USA.
</P>
<P>
   The controversey delighted Republicans, who were preparing to
use it as a campaign issue in a year when polls show that moral
values are a key area of concern for voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's Republican opponent in November's election is Gloria
Matta Tuchman, who jumped on the isue last week, saying the
congresswoman ``has embarrassed her party and embarrassed the
people of the 46th congressional district.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez became a hero to Democrats in 1996 when she narrowly
defeated a Republican hardliner incumbent, Robert Dornan, for an
Orange County congressional seat. She beat him again overwhelmingly
two years later.

MONICA LEWINSKY'S SHADOW HANGS OVER CONVENTION &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As bomb-sniffing dogs and security officers combed
the Democratic National Convention hall, party leaders on Saturday
dismissed as ``bizarre'' a contention by Republican candidate
George W. Bush that Vice President Al Gore should repudiate
President Clinton for his affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to counter Bush's effort to revive the Lewinsky
matter, Democratic chairman Edward G. Rendell insisted the Nov. 7
election is about the future, not the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was bizarre,'' Rendell told reporters, referring
to Bush's comments. ``These guys want this election to be about
Monica Lewinsky. Well, we have news for them. The American people
are not going to ... risk the quality of life of their families for
Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said Gore ``has made it clear that he in no way
sanctioned the president, that he was disappointed in the
president. That's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush told reporters that Gore should forcefully
condemn Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky, an affair that led to the
president's impeachment for obstructing justice and near-removal
from office last year. Clinton will speak Monday night in his last
convention as president and is expected to stress the Clinton-Gore
record on the economy, crime and welfare. He also is expected to
respond to claims by Bush and GOP vice presidential nominee Dick
Cheney that Clinton and Gore squandered eight years in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell confirmed that the timing of Clinton's convention speech
had been switched from Tuesday to Monday to put more distance
between the president and the convention's grand finale _ Gore's
acceptance speech on Thursday night. Clinton ``absolutely
understood,'' the need to give Gore the spotlight, Rendell said.
Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton plan to depart
Tuesday for a symbolic handoff to Gore at a campaign stop in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said Clinton will talk about his accomplishments in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to remind this country ... where we were on
Jan. 1, 1993 (just before Clinton took office) and where we've come
today,'' Rendell said. ``On all the things important to Americans,
we've come light years _ and it's no accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell also said it was likely that Clinton will touch on the
Lewinsky scandal and handle it in much the same manner as he did
earlier this week at a meeting of ministers outside Chicago.
Clinton said then that ``surely, no fair-minded person would blame
(Gore) for the mistakes I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic national co-chair Joseph Andrew took a shot the
Republican convention in Philadelphia earlier this month. ``They
had an `illusion of inclusion' convention where you saw a lot of
pretty pictures,'' Andrew said. ``We're having a convention based
on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Democratic confab, polls showed Bush
continuing to lead Gore. Four surveys, including three that focused
on registered voters, showed Bush's margin over Gore ranging from 9
percentage points in a Newsweek survey to 14 percentage points in a
survey for Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making a claim we're not behind,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell was more blunt. ``Polls are worthless,'' he said, adding
they are ``snapshots'' of an electorate in which no one is focusing
on the election.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show voters ``care about character and
leadership,'' Andrew said, they also show ``they care about
character and leadership on the issues they think are most
important. They don't just want a leader. They want a leader on the
issues they think are (important) to them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Communicating Gore's leadership qualities on those issues is
``our job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore and Bush clashed on the campaign trail over the
future of environmental cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore visited the Springdale, Pa., home of Rachel Carson, author
of the ``Silent Spring'' that helped spawn the environmental
movement, to underscore his pledge to fight corporate polluters and
the oil industry to clean the nation's air and water and reduce
dependence on foreign oil with energy-efficient vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made great strides,'' Gore declared, ``but I'm here to
tell you, you ain't seen nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Clinton-Gore administration had orchestrated the
cleanup of 500 toxic waste sites in the last seven years _ three
times as many as during the 12 years of the Reagan-Bush
presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the Pittsburgh airport by motorcade, Gore
repeatedly bounded out of his armor-plated limousine into adoring
crowds. At one impromptu stop, Gore asked the groom's permission
and offered a newly-married bride a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, Bush's campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett

waste cleanup.

   Bartlett said the so-called Superfund toxic waste site cleanup
program ``has benefited trial lawyers more than the environment,''
adding that despite more than $30 billion in federal spending it
still takes an average of eight years to clean up a site.

LORIE KANE SHOOTS A 71 TO TIE ANNIKA SORENSTAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA D. MICKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYLMER, Quebec _ Lorie Kane is down to her last red shirt. The
Canadian golfer's timing is impeccable, since the du Maurier
Classic's championship is Sunday and she is tied for the lead with
Annika Sorenstam after 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to sleep with the lead, but I know that Annika is a
fierce competitor,'' said Kane, who managed a one-under-par 71
Saturday and tied Sorenstam at six-under-par 210 when Sorenstam
bogeyed the final hole. ``Today was an under-par round,'' Kane
said, ``but it was a shaky one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kane was not the only one who had a shaky round at Royal Ottawa
Golf Club. Sorenstam wobbled in at even-par 72. Diana D'Alessio,
the first-round leader, finished with a one-over-par 73 after
incurring a one-stroke penalty on the 13th green for a moving-ball
violation on top of what turned into a triple-bogey seven. She
stands tied for third at 213 with Meg Mallon, who shot a 72.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster, who charged up the leader board on Friday to put
herself into contention, never seemed to recover from her own
triple-bogey misfortune on the fifth hole. Inkster lost her uphill
approach shot in some trees, was forced to take a lost-ball
penalty, found a bunker and quickly gave away three shots to the
field. Inkster was last seen Saturday walking off the 18th green,
shaking her head and mumbling after a 74 left her four strokes off
the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, the tournament's defending champion, took a tumble
from seventh place after 36 holes to a six-way tie for 15th (219)
after a round of 76. Webb, who has won the Nabisco Championship and
the United States Women's Open this year, lost four shots on her
last five holes Saturday to damage her bid for a third major
championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   With Royal Ottawa's small greens drying in the August sun, the
third round became one of defensive maneuvering. Sorenstam, who
normally plays with the precision of a sharpshooter, appeared out
of sync. In a highly uncharacteristic showing, the Swedish golfer
stumbled on the back nine holes with three of her four bogeys, and
only one of four birdies. It was even more uncharacteristic for
Sorenstam to yank her drive left off the tee on the 552-yard,
par-five 18th hole. Sorenstam then punched out from under a tree,
laid up with a 5-iron on an improbable 250-yard approach to the
stamp-sized green, bumped a sand wedge from 75 yards to within six
feet of the pin and nearly saved par. The putt veered left, and
Sorenstam gratefully took the bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have mixed feelings right now,'' said Sorenstam, a
five-time winner this year. ``It's a downer to bogey 18, but the
positive thing is I'm still in good shape for Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane has the momentum, coming home to Canada a week after her
long-awaited, career-first victory, which came in the Michelob
Light Classic in Eureka, Mo. She also has the overwhelming and
unabashedly biased support of her fellow Canadians in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenstam has another weapon that most others in the field
covet. She has held a final-round lead 25 times in her career, and
has won 16 of those tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger is another factor and Kane, who was a runner-up nine
times before winning, does not want to be the tour's perennial
bridesmaid. What's more, in what appears to be the final staging of
the du Maurier Classic, every red shirt on the property knows that
only one other Canadian, Jocelyne Bourassa, has ever won the event.
She did it in 1973 at the tournament's predecessor, La Canadienne,
before it became a major championship. Canadian government
anti-tobacco legislation has banned cigarette advertising at sports
and cultural events, affecting the tournament's title sponsor,
Imperial Tobacco, and Sunday's final round is likely to be this
tournament's last hurrah. Tournament organizers have yet to find a
new sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to deliver at the du Maurier Classic for Jocelyne
would mean the world to me,'' Kane said, ``and I hope that
corporate Canada also is sitting out there watching to know what
this tournament means to this country. It's an exciting time for
me, but it's also a sad time. And I have a lot of work to do
tomorrow.'' &QL;

SHOOTOUT LOOMS IN BUICK OPEN INSTEAD OF A WOODS RUNAWAY

<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. _ The huge crowd that flocked to the Buick
Open Saturday had plenty to watch, and not just Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perry, shooting a third-round 65, snatched the lead
boldly, like a house guest taking the biggest steak at a summer
barbecue. Phil Mickelson, who also shot a 65, and Woods, who shot a
67, birdied themselves into contention. Woody Austin, who started
the day with a two-stroke lead, struggled to a 73 and was
overtaken. Meanwhile, proven winners like Hal Sutton, Vijay Singh
and Paul Azinger remained within an eyelash of the lead, ready to
strike.

should be birdie-filled and intense, an exciting prelude to next
week's PGA Championship. Perry ended Saturday at 15-under-par 201,
one stroke ahead of Rocco Mediate, who had a two-under-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   The list of players with a realistic chance to win was at least
15 deep. Sutton and Austin were tied for third at 13 under par;
Azinger and Joe Ozaki were 12 under; Singh, Brad Faxon, Dudley
Hart, Skip Kendall and Mickelson were 11 under; and Paul Goydos and
Jeff Maggert were 10 under. Woods was tied at nine under par with
four players _ Fred Couples, Jeff Sluman, Robin Freeman and Kenny
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could predict what would happen Sunday. But instead of a
Woods runaway, the final round should be shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shoot a 72 tomorrow, you're not going to win the
tournament,'' said Perry, who won the 1998 B.C. Open, his only
career victory on the PGA Tour. ``There are a lot of high-profile
players on the leader board, so somebody is going to shoot a low
number. Anybody five or six back has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, fans will come, because Woods will be
there. While the tournament does not keep an official attendance
count, Saturday's crowd was estimated at 50,000, by far the largest
ever at the Buick Open. Many came to see the marquee twosome, Woods
and Mickelson, with fans packed shoulder to shoulder outside the
gallery ropes, craning their necks to get a glimpse of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Other players felt somewhat ignored, including Austin and
Mediate, who played in the final twosome and teed off almost two
and a half hours after Woods. By the time Austin and Mediate played
their final three holes, many fans had left because Mickelson and
Woods were finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the weirdest final group I've every played in,''
Mediate said. ``Tiger took all the fans with him. It was eerie. We
got to the 17th hole, and there was hardly anybody there.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier in the day, the atmosphere was like a state fair.
With cheers and yelling echoing through the trees, the electricity
surrounding the Woods-Mickelson pairing resembled a major
championship, and both players rose to the occasion. Mickelson
birdied the first four holes and put himself in position to win for
the fourth time this year. While some players are rattled playing
with Woods, Mickelson fed off the energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy playing with Tiger,'' said Mickelson, who
stopped Woods' six-tournament winning streak in February by winning
the Buick Invitational. ``What he goes through every day, I can
take in small doses. I don't know how he does it. It's so loud and
there is so much hoopla, I can't even hear. It was just all a blur.
On the first hole, it took me five minutes after hitting into the
trees to get people out of the way so they were not in danger to
hit another shot. You basically need to keep it in play when you
play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mickelson kept his head, and he forced Woods to keep up.
Woods did not make his first birdie until the fifth hole, but then
he proceeded to birdie Nos. 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 to reach 10 under
par. Woods made a double-bogey at the par-4 No.15, however, hitting
a tee shot into the trees, his second shot into the front bunker, a
bad bunker shot 15 feet past the cup and a chip 4 feet past the
hole, followed by a missed putt.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods does not win, he will lament that hole as a turning
point. But the big picture for Woods this week is to prepare for
the PGA Championship. Based on his ball-striking and performance
Saturday, he appeared headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if I could make a few birdies, I could feed off of
Phil,'' Woods said. ``If not, I was going to get left high and dry.
I finally made a few, but I could have made a few more.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the crowd _ some fans chanted Woods' name between
shots and others chanted Mickelson's name, not to mention other
comments _ Woods smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty interesting, huh?'' said Woods, whose announcement that
he would be playing more than doubled ticket sales. ``They're the
biggest crowds I've ever seen here. And when the noise gets between
the trees, it starts to echo.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will be paired with Goydos on Sunday, while Perry and
Mediate will be in the final group. Perry, the son of the former
baseball pitcher Jim Perry and the nephew of the Hall of Fame
pitcher Gaylord Perry, is 39th on this year's money list and is
ranked No.24 in the world, so this week's performance is hardly a
shock. Yet, while Perry contends regularly, he has had trouble
finishing the job. Perry hoped to change that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play like I'm three or four strokes behind
tomorrow,'' said Perry, who shot 31 on the back nine, including an
eagle at No.14. ``I'm looking forward to the challenge.''

TORRES DIVES BACK IN AT 33 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ So this girl comes up to Dara Torres at a swim
meet this year and says something nasty about Torres taking away
her spot on the Olympic team. ``I'm like, whatever,'' Torres said.
``Who are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these kids who were still in diapers when Torres won her
first gold medal 16 years ago? Did they even know her as a swimmer?
Or just as the high priestess of Tae-Bo workouts on cable TV?
</P>
<P>
   Who is this 33-year-old with an 18-year-old body who stays out
of the water for seven years and thinks she can just show up at the
trials and make the Olympic team again? And not just make it, but
make it in a half-dozen events?
</P>
<P>
   Torres already has made it in the 100-meter butterfly, which is
the event she does for fun. She's favored to make it in Monday
night's 100-meter freestyle, which would guarantee her a place on
the 4 x 100 freestyle relay and probably on the 4 x 100 medley
relay, too. And if she's still humming a month from now, the
coaches could put Torres on the 4 x 200 freestyle relay, even
though she pulled out of the 200 freestyle here with uterine cramps
after the Friday prelims.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody her age has ever left this lung-busting sport, come back
two quadrennia later, and been faster than before. Nobody. Dara
Torres is simply too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the whisperers are saying. Just too good to be true.
Just like the East Germans in the 1970s. Just like the Chinese in
the '90s. Just like Michelle Smith, the Irish swimmer who won three
gold medals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It just doesn't happen that way. Not in this sport. ``Are you
insinuating that people think I'm on drugs because I swim fast?''
Torres said last week when the subject of raised eyebrows came up.
</P>
<P>
   Just because she has set American records in the 50 freestyle
and 100 butterfly this year at an age when most swimmers have
retired to motherhood doesn't necessarily mean Torres is on the
wrong side of the doping lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with (US coach) Richard Quick about this the
other day,'' Torres said. ``We talked about Lance Armstrong and how
people were insinuating that he was (on drugs) because he made this
miraculous comeback in cycling. And you see someone like (Dutch
swimmer) Inge de Bruijn and people are insinuating her and you
know, it's too bad. Why do people have to emphasize drugs because
someone does something really fast? I don't have words to describe
it. It just infuriates me. The bottom line is everyone has a
conscience. And for me, I know that I've done everything I can to
get where I am the right way _ and I'm ready to swim fast.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of things, Torres said. It's technique and
conditioning and stretching and nutrition and diet supplements and
maturity _ and talent. It's not like she was a former mediocrity,
like Smith, who came out of nowhere to win a fistful of medals.
</P>
<P>
   Torres held the world mark in the 50 free for three years before
it was an Olympic event. She won relay medals in three consecutive
Olympics and captained the US team in Barcelona in 1992. When she
made her comeback, her time was still ranked among the US top five
in the 100 free. It's not as if Torres was some age-grouper who had
to make a deal with the devil to get to Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no swimmer has ever left the pool for seven years and
come back anywhere near competitive. Most struggle to make two
Olympic teams in a row. Summer Sanders won four medals in 1992 and
didn't come close to making the 1996 team. Amy Van Dyken won four
gold medals in Atlanta and will be lucky to make a relay this time.
Beth Botsford won the Olymoic gold medal in the 100 backstroke four
years ago. She was last in the final here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Too many things work against a reprise _ age, injury, illness,
marriage, children, diminished motivation. Only one other American
woman (Jill Sterkel in 1976-80-84-88) has ever made four Olympic
swimming teams. And until the middle of last year, Torres had no
intention of even trying for this one.
</P>
<P>
   She went to Atlanta four years ago and watched everything but
the swimming. ``I had no idea who was competing, what was going on,
nothing. I had no desire to watch it, no desire to be involved in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That life was over. Torres was modeling and doing TV work. If
she wore a swimsuit, it was alongside the supermodels in Sports
Illustrated's annual issue. Then, suddenly, she was craving
chlorine again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody egged me on,'' Torres said. ``Planted a seed in my
head and the seed just grew. I couldn't get it out of my head. So I
said, OK, I'd better do something about this.''
</P>
<P>
   So Torres called Quick, who coaches Stanford, and asked if she
could train with the varsity. She was in the middle of her first
workout, cruising along (or so she thought), when Quick tossed a
kickboard into her lane. ``Dara,'' he informed her, ``we don't swim
that way anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven years might as well have been 700, everything was so
different. But Torres had several things going for her. She had the
ideal sprinter's body _ 5 feet 11 inches, 145 pounds. She was still
in terrific shape from her Tae-Bo workouts. She'd been a
world-class swimmer and knew what it took. ``I've been there,'' she
said. ``I've done it before.'' And she still had a sprinter's
competitive heart.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that she and training partner Jenny Thompson, who had
won three gold relay medals in Atlanta, ended up having to work
apart from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're training for the same events every single day, twice
a day, and both of you are going for the same thing and there's
only one of those things out there,'' Torres said, ``you know it
can get very intense.''
</P>
<P>
   With Van Dyken coming off shoulder surgery, Thompson had become
America's new sprint queen. She owned the world titles in the 100
freestyle and 100 butterfly and anchored the freestyle relay. Last
year, she had broken Mary T. Meagher's world mark in the 100 fly
that had stood for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now came Torres, back to her Olympian form in five months. She
went to spring nationals this year, won the 50 and 100 free, and
posted seven lifetime bests. She broke the US record in the 50 that
Van Dyken had set winning the Olympics. Torres wasn't just faster
than she'd ever been. She was faster than almost everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that people thought it was drugs rankled her. It was a
complex blend, Torres said. It was nutrition. ``I eat a lot more
protein now,'' she said. ``When I was younger, I used to carbo-load
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was months of demanding workouts. It was the modern technique
she'd picked up. It was the coaching of Quick, who has a knack with
sprinters. It was her special stretching routine, something called
Meridian Resistance Flexibility. Two trainers ``mash'' her before
each race, walking all over Torres's body and legs to relax the
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   It was the new Lycra bodysuits everyone's wearing. It was the
wisdom that comes with age. ``I know not to waste my energy
worrying about what other people are doing,'' she said. It's the
two dozen supplements like creatine, amino acids, proteins, and
multivitamins that she and Thompson and other elite swimmers take
to help them, as Thompson said, ``beat the cheaters without
cheating''.
</P>
<P>
   It was all that, Torres claimed, and no more. ``If I ever
thought an athlete of mine was possibly cheating,'' Quick insisted
last week, ``I wouldn't coach them for one more second.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, who says that a woman is washed up at 33 these days?
Maureen O'Toole is 39. She's on the US water polo team for Sydney.
Carol Skricki is 38. She's on the rowing team. Both Dot Richardson
and Sheila Douty are 38. They're on the softball team.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what happens in Monday's 100 free, the Americans
could have a sprint relay at Sydney that averages 30. By that
standard, Dara Torres is in the prime of life. Like Forrest Gump's
father, she's merely been on vacation. ``I think I just needed a
seven-year taper,'' she said.

BROWN WILL HELP CELTICS IN SEVERAL WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a steak dinner at Abe &AMP; Louie's, point guard Randy Brown
met with Celtics coach Rick Pitino for the first time. There were a
few phone calls between the player and coach before Brown signed a
free agent contract for the $2.25 million exception, but no
face-to-face conversations until the meat and potatoes. The meal
followed the official announcement of the deal Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino gave Brown plenty to digest over dinner, specifically
what sounded like ``30,000 stories'' to the newest Celtic. The men
discussed basketball and leadership, road games and buzzer-beaters,
and the playoffs for about two hours. ``We talked about me being
his voice in the locker room,'' said Brown. And by the time player
and coach left the restaurant, Brown had a copy of Pitino's latest
book on leadership in hand, having ``begged him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Chicago preparing for training camp with weightlifting
and conditioning drills, the 6-foot-2-inch, 191-pound Brown is also
working his way through ``Lead to Succeed: 10 Traits of Great
Leadership in Business and Life.'' Brown gives the book a
respectable review. ``It's good,'' he said. ``But it's different
from what I thought it was going to be by looking at the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   First impressions and free agents make an interesting
combination. Sometimes you get just what you expect. Sometimes a
little more. Sometimes a little less.
</P>
<P>
   Since exception-level players come wrapped in very few
exaggerated claims, it's not too hard to read Brown. Unable to snag
a more valued free agent, the Celtics got a 32-year-old backup
point guard for $7.5 million over three years (he makes the
mid-level exception this season and holds the option for the third
year).
</P>
<P>
   Brown comes with three championship rings, two surgically
repaired ankles, and the veteran leadership qualities Pitino has
pined for. (``You look at our basketball team and we've been void
of mature leadership,'' said Pitino. ``It's evident that he has
it.'') Brown purposely chose a situation where he would be a backup
to cut down on wear and tear and sustain his NBA career as long as
possible. He left his hometown of Chicago because the uncertainty
of rebuilding with the Bulls wasn't what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Brown believes his role with the Celtics is clearly defined:
Give starting point guard Kenny Anderson a rest in the middle of
games so he can be strong in the fourth quarter, help the second
unit sustain leads built by the starters, share the experience
gained during nine years in the NBA, lead whenever necessary. No
more. No less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to come in and throw these championship rings in
their faces,'' said Brown. ``I don't think they need to see that.
I'm just going to come in and be positive, give criticism where
it's needed, and get them in the frame of mind that every game is a
winnable game.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me being 32 and getting a chance to be a free agent
again, it was real important that I get a chance to venture out in
the NBA and get to know some new players and get to know a new
system. That's a challenge that's going to be put in front of me
(with the Celtics) and I'm a person that's always loved challenges.
Once I was (in the NBA), I made a vow that I was never going to be
kicked out. Each year I've tried to improve. I want to go out on my
own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   While he hopes his new situation in Boston will energize him and
prolong his career, the decision to leave Chicago and the team he
grew up rooting for was difficult for Brown. (Fellow Chicagoan
Antoine Walker called Brown and welcomed him to the Celtics.) His
first run through free agency allowed Brown to leave Sacramento,
which drafted him 31st overall in 1991, and return to Chicago in
1995. His family regularly attended games in the Windy City and he
fulfilled a childhood dream as part of the Bulls' championship
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Brown credits playing Chicago high school ball with giving him
the toughness that's helped his NBA career last. As a ``blue-collar
city,'' Brown said Chicago instills mental toughness and a strong
work ethic in its players. The city has produced an impressive list
of talented point guards, including Isiah Thomas, Quinn Buckner,
Tim Hardaway, Doc Rivers, and Maurice Cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Chicago, you learn to be tough,'' said Brown.
``You learn to fight through adversity and hard times. When you're
a point guard and you make it out of Chicago, it means you've
fought through a lot of adversity and done some good things. If you
can survive Chicago basketball, you can survive anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   While playing in Chicago's Public League at Collins High School
may have been about survival, competing for the Bulls was more
about learning. In fact, Brown admits that some of his basketball
development may have been slowed as a member of the championship
teams with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed with Chicago, I knew I was going to become a
role player,'' said Brown. ``But when you're playing with Michael
Jordan and Scottie Pippen, how many points do you have to score?''
Instead of scoring, Brown watched and learned how Jordan cultivated
a winning attitude among his less-talented teammates, getting
everyone to maximize their effort in games.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing little on offense, Brown was tagged a defensive
specialist. And it's a label he doesn't like. He would rather be
considered ``an athletic player who can score when needed and is
good on defense.'' If Brown had to choose a label, it would be ``a
basketball player who goes out and plays off energy.'' Over nine
years in the NBA, Brown has averaged 5.1 points per game, 2.2
assists, 1.1 steals, and 1.8 rebounds in the regular season. In 47
playoff games, the statistics drop dramatically (1.6 points per
game, 0.5 assists, 0.6 rebounds, 0.3 steals).
</P>
<P>
   Although he experienced the Bulls dynasty in the 1990s, Brown
doesn't dare compare it with the Celtics' tradition, noting his new
team is ``on a different wavelength.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that (the Celtics) have had some great
players,'' said Brown. ``It shows what type of players they've had
because I can't even get a number to go on my jersey right now.
Every number that a basketball player dreams of putting on is up in
the rafters. Maybe I'll wear the year I was born, '68, or
something. I don't think there's another organization in the NBA
that's going to have a problem with guys picking out numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Brown, the big numbers will stay on the jersey. He is
comfortable with his role as a backup with a big voice.

FOOTBALL IS NO. 1 OF BIG FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A game of 20 questions with an NFL geek:
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's obvious you're worked up over something. What's your
agenda?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm out to prove that football makes more sense than any of
America's four ``major'' pro sports. It's not even close. I don't
know who started this chatter about the poetry of baseball _
probably Bob Costas _ but football is the country's true national
pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you saying you don't like baseball, basketball, and
hockey?
</P>
<P>
   A. Typical reporter. Putting words in my mouth. No wonder Carl
Everett doesn't talk to you losers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My bad. I'll rephrase the question: Do you like the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. What I don't like is carrying around a glossary so I can
understand why a trade did or did not happen. All I've heard about
this summer is base-year compensation guys, sign-and-trade guys,
and midlevel-exception guys. No fan wants to hear that. We want to
hear about the next great point guard splitting defenses as if he
were a metaphorical Moses splitting the Red Sea. But when NBA
general managers talk, they all sound like CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about hockey?
</P>
<P>
   A. They make you wait until you're 30 for no-strings-attached
free agency. You can lose five first-round picks if you sign
certain ``free'' agents. Who did they consult when they came up
with that system? Fidel Castro? Come on. Next question.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your problem with baseball?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's for rich boys only. You always see the same names
(Yankees, Indians, Braves) on the World Series RSVP list. And at
the beginning of the season, you always have a group of teams
(Twins, Expos, Royals) who essentially declare themselves out of
championship contention. That would never happen in football,
America's true pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Q. That's a tough argument to make in Boston. Don't you know
this is a baseball town?
</P>
<P>
   A. Dude. You are so late 1980s in your view of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Maybe it used to be that simple. Now, people in Boston and
everywhere else love football. Small example: On Aug. 4, the
Patriots and Red Sox went head to head on television. The Patriots
were playing the Detroit Lions in a boring exhibition game. The Sox
were playing the sad Royals, but it was an August game, meaning it
had pennant-race implications. The Patriots easily won in the
ratings, 10.7 to 7.8.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're not going to anoint football as the region's/nation's
primary sport based purely on ratings, are you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Settle down, Sam Donaldson. As I told you before, I like
football because it almost always makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you give an example?
</P>
<P>
   A. I love how the sport constantly corrects itself. It gave us
instant replay and it was slow. Replay was junked. When replay
demands were renewed, the system returned, much cleaner and
quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But where was the clean and quick replay when Tennessee rode
what appeared to be an illegal pass all the way to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A. I know you ask the questions, but a better question is this:
Where was Buffalo's special teams coverage?
</P>
<P>
   Q. What else?
</P>
<P>
   A. I like that players receive 63 percent of revenues and that
owners have a hard salary cap. I like that well-managed teams _ not
well-bankrolled teams _ are rewarded. I like the fact that you can
see evolution happen before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Evolution?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yeah. Ten years ago, you didn't see a 280-pound linebacker
(Levon Kirkland) who could drop back into coverage. As recently as
five years ago, there were no Jevon Kearses. Soon, you'll see guys
like Michael Vick and Donovan McNabb turn the sport upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does that include NFL broadcasting, which gave us Howard
Cosell and now Dennis Miller?
</P>
<P>
   A. Maybe. But it would have been more innovative if ABC had a
different commentator each week working with Al and Dan. I would
vote for a rotating roster that had the likes of Miller, Eminem,
Camille Paglia, Chris Rock, Alan Keyes, Alanis Morissette, Cornel
West, Mr. Lif, and Cedric the Entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. More than 100 million Americans watch at least one NFL game
every weekend. Why is that?
</P>
<P>
   A. America loves the little guy. Green Bay, the smallest city in
the NFL, can win the Super Bowl. One reason is that the league has
the best TV deal in sports. When the current contract expires, each
team will have received $500 million over eight years. That
eliminates the ``Sorry, we're broke'' defense from owners and makes
them accountable to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you saying NFL teams can't lose money?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. If they lose money, it's in ``taxable losses.'' To me,
losing money is when you place a $50 bill on a desk, leave the
room, and come back to find it gone. That's losing real money. NFL
owners don't lose real money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Exactly. So why did owners such as Georgia Frontiere, Art
Modell, and Bud Adams move their teams, claiming they couldn't make
it in Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Houston?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because they're either greedy or bad owners. In Modell's
case, he was both. All of them could have stayed in their
respective cities; they simply saw an opportunity to make more
money elsewhere and left. That's as American as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I see some inconsistencies in your money talk. How do you
explain the Washington Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   A. Tremendous talent. Strange owner. Racist nickname. Could go
anywhere from 8-8 to 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   Q. No. I mean, how do you explain their manipulation of the
salary cap?
</P>
<P>
   A. Washington is not cheating. The organization has simply
decided to try to win now, knowing that it will have major cap
problems in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I find it interesting that you haven't mentioned the NFL's
alleged and convicted criminals. Where's the next expansion team
going to be? Sing Sing?
</P>
<P>
   A. You could say the same for any sport. The NFL just receives
more attention. And it's going to receive attention because it is,
clearly, the pastime. First game is three Sundays from now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Fair enough. But NFL coaches, as a rule, give awful press
conferences. Can you defend that?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I said the sport makes more sense than all the others. I
didn't say it was perfect.

THIRD TIME IS NOT THE CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patriots started the exhibition season with the lowly San
Francisco 49ers, lifted the bar against the Detroit Lions, and
Friday night played the highly regarded Washington Redskins. They
next face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and complete the slate with a
slightly easier game against the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots probably felt facing good teams would better
prepare them for the regular season, during which they play nine
games against playoff teams and have the fifth-toughest schedule in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   New England rolled past the weak 49ers (20-0), had a tough time
against the average-to-above-average Lions (13-10), and was
outplayed by what appeared to be a better team in Washington
(30-20). It's only the exhibition season, but does this show the
Patriots will handle the weak teams, evenly battle the average
teams, and struggle against the tough teams?
</P>
<P>
   So far, the same problems that plagued the team a year ago are
still there. Third down continues to be a nightmare on both sides
of the ball. The offense went 2 for 9 on third-down conversions
Friday night, and the defense allowed a couple of successful
third-and-long plays by the Redskins, who finished 9 for 17 on
third down.
</P>
<P>
   Time of possession also was a problem. The offense spent fewer
than 20 minutes on the field, the defense played more than 40.
There also were special teams breakdowns and fumbles. If this is a
more disciplined team than last year's, where's the proof?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a period of growing pains when you put in
something new, even though you're practicing it you're seeing it
live at a different speed,'' said Patriots coach Bill Belichick.
``That's part of it, but I don't want to make an excuse. That's
reality. Also reality is some of the stuff we've been practicing
for a long time we're missing a little timing too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said the offense needs to improve, but he's weighing
the breakdowns on defense and special teams as well.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't point the finger at quarterback Drew Bledsoe's
lack of protection, in fact he characterized it as ``reasonably
good.'' However, on the first play of the game, Bruce Smith turned
Jason Andersen inside-out and nailed Bledsoe. That didn't set a
great tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had expected things to be better in all three areas,'' said
Belichick after studying video of the game. ``I told the players
it's a combination of things. We need to coach better and players
need to play better. We're going to make it happen on the field, so
collectively we need to make it better. We have to pull together
and get things tightened up.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been more talk about Bledsoe's mechanics, with some
believing he's throwing off his back foot again, and about the
receivers running sloppy routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say we have to improve the passing game, I mean the
throwing, the catching, the route-running,'' said Belichick. ``I'm
talking about the precision of the routes, so that if the ball
doesn't go to one player then he effectively carries that coverage
out of the way so it opens it up somewhere else. We need to run the
routes at the right depth, with the proper execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of dropped balls. We had a couple of throws
that could have been better and we had a couple of protection
problems, a bad snap and all that. Several logs on the fire created
a situation where we need to tighten up a lot of screws. It would
be more of a concern if it was the same thing every time, if
protection broke down every time we tried to throw. But it seemed
that three or four things were pretty good and one thing was
missing, a different thing every time, which affected the success
of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is it wasn't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick lauded the play of Kevin Faulk, who was the primary
back in the multiple-receiver sets and had two 40-yard-plus kick
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also said something that was eerily similar to Pete
Carroll of last year: ``I thought we had a good week of practice.
We were crisp. Our Wednesday practice was probably the crispest
practice we've had all year. We pretty much hit everything. We were
sharp on everything, though all that counts is how you do it when
the lights go on. Everybody felt real good coming off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest and Chad Eaton continue to excel on the
defensive line, Lawyer Milloy and Ty Law (who had an interception)
in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think overall defensively it's been respectable,'' Belichick
said. ``The thing we haven't done a good job on is third down.
We're staying on the field too long. If we can get off the field on
third down that leads to more first downs and more time of
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively we're hurting our offense by not creating better
field position for them. If we can get the third-down situation
cleared up, it'll go a long way for us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belichick didn't believe rookie running back J.R. Redmond was
ready to play Friday night, even after he'd had a few days of
practice . . . Belichick held out linebacker Tedy Bruschi, who has
a broken right hand, but the coach believes Bruschi likely won't be
restricted by the cast when the regular season starts . . .
Belichick had the players in Smithfield, R.I., for film work and a
workout Saturday, but camp is officially over and the team shifts
back to Foxborough for the remainder of the season. Belichick
wasn't sure if he would reduce the workouts to one a day because
``we have a lot of things to cover and I want to make sure we have
the time to get it all in.'' . . . The Patriots are looking for a
defensive end. One veteran still on the free agent market is Neil
Smith.

WILLIAMS' STRATEGY IS PITCHER FRIENDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For many Red Sox fans, there has been nothing
more aggravating to watch this summer than teams running at will on
catchers Jason Varitek and Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are close to a stolen-base-a-game pace against the Sox,
with 108 steals in 111 games entering Saturday night's contest
against Texas. The Rangers didn't steal a base in the series opener
Friday night, but that's only because they are one of the league's
most plodding teams, swiping just 45 bases, a total not surpassed
only by the 28 by the Sox (of course) and the 27 by the A's, a team
built along beer-league dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, who threw out 26 percent of the runners who ran on him
a year ago (40 of 152), has succeeded in throwing out just 16 of 94
base runners this season, 17 percent. Of regular AL catchers, only
Greg Zaun (8 of 51, 15.7 percent) has a worse percentage, in far
fewer chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg has caught just 5 of 35 base stealers, or 14.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to look at the numbers,'' Varitek said recently.
``All I know is I'm doing everything I can.''
</P>
<P>
   You watch Varitek, and most of his throws are strong and on the
mark. Hatteberg, who had elbow surgery last year, doesn't have the
same arm strength, but he still can sling it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jimy Williams where Varitek ranks among the league's
catchers in terms of his arm, and the Sox manager puts him near the
top. ``He has a very good arm,'' Williams said. ``He throws a
stream of milk down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek has mentioned that he throws to second in 1.9 seconds,
which should give him a better than fighting chance against most
stealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a clock guy,'' Williams said. ``I've never had a
stopwatch. I've been watching these catchers throw. I have my own
clock.''
</P>
<P>
   So if it isn't the catchers, then what's the problem? Williams
offers a simple explanation. Red Sox pitchers, with runners on
base, don't use the slide-step, the technique designed to cut down
on their leg kick and thus shorten the time in which they deliver
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   A dumb move? Hardly. Williams pulls out a sheet of paper listing
the league's pitching statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we in ERA?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   First, with a 4.14 ERA, almost a full percentage point under the
league average (4.97).
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we rank in walks?''
</P>
<P>
   First. They've walked just 339 batters, 22 fewer than the next
closest team, Detroit, with 361.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we in wild pitches?''
</P>
<P>
   You know the answer. First, with 19. And by now, you've probably
figured out that the opposition batting average of .257 is the
lowest in the league, 19 percentage points below the league average
of .276.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitcher has a better chance of misfiring when he uses the
slide-step,'' Williams said. ``The slide-step can affect both stuff
and location.''
</P>
<P>
   But, but . . . but what about all those stolen bases?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Williams said, ``you can't steal
first.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes a compelling argument, of course. If all those steals
were leading to more runners crossing home plate, then the Sox
would have to adjust. And late in the season, especially in
October, when the games generally are lower-scoring and every run
becomes more precious, the Sox' inability to shut down the
opposition's running game could become magnified.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, the decision to abandon the slide-step was not made
lightly by Williams. The supposed seat-of-the-pants manager
carefully has weighed the pluses and minuses, and his way works.
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason he's down on the slide-step. ``As long as
I'm here, I want our pitchers to have the longest career they
possibly can have, and with the slide-step you can't do it. You
have a better chance of hurting yourself when you slide-step. First
of all, it's not normal. You're asking a pitcher to change his
delivery, and when you do that, you increase the chance he might
hurt his shoulder or elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Pedro Martinez two years ago, `Pedro, I want you to
pitch a long time. I don't want you to ever feel that I asked you
to do something that might hurt you.' I'd rather have a guy steal a
base. I really would.''
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez, Varitek has thrown out just one of eight
attempted base stealers. With Derek Lowe on the mound, Sox catchers
are 0 for 6, not unusual when a closer is in the game and focusing
all of his attention on getting the batter out. John Wasdin left
this as his legacy. All 12 runners who attempted to steal when
Wasdin was in the game succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   And with Tim Wakefield, the knuckleballer on the mound, only 1
of 24 would-be stealers have been caught.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you turn to the guy on the next barstool and
complain that Sox catchers couldn't throw out 80-year-old Johnny
Pesky, have a little compassion for the Sox' masked men. It's not
their fault.

FOLLOWERS KNOW TRUTH ABOUT RUIZ 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ One in the Boston crowd marveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny and Stoney and Gabe all went out to Smith &AMP; Wollensky's
(steakhouse) the other night on the Strip,'' the story began.
``Just the three of 'em. And the bill? It was $364 . . . for just
the three of 'em. Give all of us $364 to eat and we'd be eating
three squares for a week and still come back at you with change.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   Once again.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the boxing world can call Saturday night's heavyweight
fight a scam and a charade, because despite being considered the
World Boxing Association's No. 1 contender, Evander Holyfield's
opponent still goes by the extra-long name ``Someone Named Johnny
Ruiz.'' And doesn't the whole world know that Lennox Lewis is the
heavyweight champion regardless of what happens here?
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Just a body to put in the ring. Just a body to ensure that
promoter Don King once again pulls off a scam, in the meantime
praising the stars and stripes and saying _ perhaps for the 50th
time in the last hour _ that no country on the face of the earth
can compare to America. ``Isn't America great?'' bellows King.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others here, from Chelsea and Somerville and
Cambridge, Mass., others who've watched for years and years from
2,500 miles away the glitter and glitz and kitsch of a title fight
in Las Vegas. Perhaps with envy. But now they are here, part of the
entourage of Johnny Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   And, for them, this is no charade. This is no scam. This is
living.
</P>
<P>
   They saw their man, Ruiz, stand up at the weigh-in and then
heard him say afterward, ``I feel great. I feel comfortable. I feel
ready for the big fight.''
</P>
<P>
   About 500 of them bought their tickets for the fight directly
from the Somerville Boxing Club, Ruiz's gym, and once word got out
about the big crowd headed out to the desert, approximately 500
more bought tickets. ``The sales went off the chart,'' said Norman
Stone, ``Stoney,'' Ruiz's manager. ``Just imagine . . . 500 from
our gym alone.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to remind any of them that the reputation _ nay,
redemption _ of Boston heavyweights was in Ruiz's hands. ``We know,
we know,'' said Tony Cardinale, Ruiz's lawyer. ``We all know about
Peter (McNeeley). Johnny's no Peter. Don't even mention them in the
same breath.''
</P>
<P>
   And they lingered around as Gabe Mari, Ruiz's trainer, said he
has seen Ruiz go ``from a 1 to a 9 1/2'' on a scale of 10 since
Mari started working with Ruiz. ``And he'll be a 10 once he knocks
off Holyfield,'' said Mari.
</P>
<P>
   They wandered around the new and plush Paris Hotel and swapped
stories. One in the Boston entourage buttonholed one and then
buttonholed all, saying he had heard that Lou Duva was at a boxing
card last week in Connecticut ``and Lou says Johnny's got a shot.
That's what Lou Duva says. Johnny's got a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And when any skeptical souls from outside of Massachusetts
mentioned the name David Tua, and how Ruiz had gotten knocked out
by Tua after a mere 17 seconds of the first round, all had their
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago,'' the Bostonians said. ``And Johnny's a lot
smarter since then. Johnny made a big mistake when Tua knocked him
into the ropes. He bounced right back off the ropes and into Tua's
punch. If he didn't bounce off the ropes, Johnny maybe survives.
Now Johnny knows what to do if he's hit into the ropes . . . but
Holyfield's not going to hit him into the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   When skeptical talk by outsiders centered back on how Lewis is
the only true heavyweight champion, the Bostonians would gather
around King, the bombastic promoter, for verbal nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis wouldn't fight the WBA's No. 1 contender, ``so I went to
federal court to have Lewis's WBA title taken away from him. And
one of the great jurists of the age, a judge that even Louis
Brandeis could not equal in his wisdom, the most honorable Judge
Lewis Kaplan, ruled that no one is above the law. Isn't America a
great country when our judges are so wise?'' King said with a
straight face.
</P>
<P>
   And Ralph Palmacci wasn't missing a beat of it. Palmacci, 81,
who is from Cambridge and goes to the Somerville gym as often as
possible, was basking in every moment of the week. And don't dare
say a negative word about Ruiz in Palmacci's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of detractors in the beginning,'' said
Palmacci, ``and you know what'd they say? And they'd say, `He has a
jab . . . that's all he has.' '' The ultimate putdown for a
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner from Palmacci, workmen were putting up
the final staging for the grandstand in a huge ballroom of the
Paris Hotel. The boxing ring looked so out of place on a deep
carpet in the middle of a room ornate with gold. But, still, this
was for the title, no matter where it was being held, and Palmacci
was in the spirit of the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of great fighters in my time,'' Palmacci was
saying, ``and I've never ever seen one with the concentration of
Johnny. The concentration he has when he works out . . . he just
seems to wipe everything else out of his mind. Then I hear people
ask what kind of strategy is he going to have against this guy
Holyfield. And I say Johnny's going to be doing what he's been
doing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Working the jabs . . . a right cross . . . stepping over . . .
12-punch combinations he throws without missing a punch.''
</P>
<P>
   A 12-punch combination?
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it in one of his fights and I counted the punches . . .
12 of 'em,'' said Palmacci. ``Twelve that finally knocked him down
and knocked him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmacci's brother-in-law is Red Priest, one of the better
middleweights in New England from several generations ago (``He's
got Alzheimer's now, real bad''), and Palmacci went into detail
about how his brother-in-law ``filled up the (Boston) Garden three
or four times. So I've been around the game a long time. A lot of
years. It's a disease, this boxing game, but I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmacci spent his life as a roofer when he wasn't boxing and
now, being in Las Vegas for a title bout for a fighter he has seen
grow and grow for the last dozen years, is as close to paradise as
can be found on earth for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I say,'' Palmacci said again, ``boxing's a disease, and I
got it bad.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif _ When it comes to taking responsibility for the
welfare of his team, very few come close to the Angels' Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   After a 4-2 loss Wednesday to former team, the Red Sox, Vaughn
made it clear he was taking responsibility. In the game he went 0
for 4, stranding six baserunners, including four in scoring
position. He made the final out of the inning each time he left
runners on.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Vaughn sat quietly at his locker, staring
straight ahead, ice pack on his left biceps.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter approached, and before the reporter could utter a
word, Vaughn said: ``Wait. I only want to do this once. Let's get
everybody over here first.''
</P>
<P>
   A few other reporters wandered over and Vaughn was ready. But no
question was asked. Unprovoked, Vaughn started in on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take this game on my shoulders, on my back,'' he said. ``You
want to be a big-league hitter and hit third, you don't leave 10
runners on base. I'm hitting .190 against left-handers! That's the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has always prided himself on being able to hit
left-handers. Going into this season, he was hitting .299 against
them in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting left-handers has always been a part of my game,'' he
said. ``It's always been an asset. This has got to stop. It will
stop. I've got to make adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous. I've had too many opportunities all season.''
</P>
<P>
   TICK, TICK, TICK: Is Boston's Carl Everett another ticking time
bomb waiting go off?
</P>
<P>
   Everett served his suspension for head-butting umpire Ron Kulpa,
and on the day he was to return, Everett got into a heated argument
with Red Sox manager Jimy Williams. The subject: During his
suspension, Everett left the team during a road trip for a day
without telling anybody or asking permission.
</P>
<P>
   Williams explained to Everett how that was not acceptable, and
the argument followed. How will the Red Sox deal with a hothead?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make some adjustments in regards to that
behavior,'' Red Sox GM Dan Duquette said. ``And certainly Carl
will, too.''
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLE STANDARD: In a recent game between the Blue Jays and
Mariners, three Blue Jays were hit by pitches. Yet it was Blue Jays
pitcher John Frascatore who was thrown out of the game for throwing
inside to Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez. The pitch did not hit
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi was not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't pitch (Rodriguez) inside, and three of my guys
get hit and the umpires don't do a thing ... it's absolute B.S. by
the umpires,'' Fregosi said.

   BRONX REVIVAL: What is it about the Yankees and ex-Angels? The
Yankees always seem to have an interest in ex-Angels, from Chili
Davis to Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Again this season, the Yankees have quite a few _ reserve
catcher Chris Turner, infielder Luis Sojo, outfielder Luis Polonia
and relievers Jason Grimsley and Allen Watson.

   Apparently Rudy Meoli is unavailable.

   RESTLESS IN SEATTLE: Mariners manager Lou Piniella recently
hired an agent to negotiate for him at the end of the season when
his contract is up. Piniella is in his eighth season with Seattle,
and could command big money if the Mariners win the American League
West and play well in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a contract extension over the winter, but with
a new general manager (Pat Gillick), I thought it would be best to
wait and see how things worked out,'' Piniella said. &QL;

DODGERS MAY FIND OFFSEASON ARM SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Dodgers look to re-tool a pitching staff
that could need anywhere from one to three quality starters next
season, expect them to go the free-agent route.
</P>
<P>
   But just how many high-end pitchers will be available when the
free-agency market opens in November is open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   As it's turning out, the class of the free-agent market will be
Baltimore right-hander Mike Mussina and Mets lefty Mike Hampton.
But a baseball official said he expected the Mets to make a hard
run to re-sign Hampton before the free-agent market opens, and
added that Baltimore would do everything in its power to re-sign
Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   The market already was slimmed down this week when San Francisco
signed left-hander Kirk Rueter to a three-year, $15.6 million
contract extension. Rueter, who is 8-7 with a 3.36 ERA,
acknowledged he signed for below market cost, but added that he
wanted to stay in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to them and said, 'I want to stay here. What will it
take to keep me here?'`' said Rueter's agent, Tommy Tanzer. ``They
offered him a contract and he took it. There were very little
negotiations for me. It's a great deal for the Giants. Kirk is very
happy. This is what he wanted to do. This opens up a can of worms,
in my mind. They were a little leery of dealing directly with a
player. (But) it's a deal they couldn't refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were reportedly working on a deal to keep lefty
Denny Neagle and sources said the Dodgers will work hard to keep
right-hander Darren Dreifort. It could leave Mets right-hander Rick
Reed as one of the few mid-range pitchers available.
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY MAKEOVER: Philadelphia went into the All-Star break with
one look but a month later they're a very different team. And one
that is built to be competitive in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the trading of Andy Ashby to Atlanta for
left-hander Bruce Chen, but the big deal was Curt Schilling to
Arizona for pitchers Omar Daal, Vicente Padilla and Nelson Figueroa
and first baseman Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies also sent Desi Relaford to San Diego for David
Newhan and got Kent Bottenfield from the Angels for free
agent-to-be Ron Gant and dropped $1.3 million of payroll when
Boston claimed Rico Brogna off waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of things that would have been done at the end of
the season,'' GM Ed Wade said. ``Curt was the wild card. It was the
most difficult decision. There was no guarantee Curt was going to
open that window (i.e. waive his no-trade) again. So we were
looking at two scenarios. No.1, extend him for three or four years;
or No.2., lose him to free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   DRIVING MR. NO ONE: The Dodgers open a three-game series at
Florida on Monday, and one way to tell just how dire the situation
is for the Dodgers is to look at whether Luis Castillo drives in a
run. Castillo is challenging the dubious mark of failing to drive
in runs. He entered Saturday with nine RBI, leaving him on a pace
for 13. The mark for fewest RBI by a player with 450 at-bats or
more is 12, established by Enzo Hernandez in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's been absolutely paralyzed by it. It'll be a relief
when it's over,'' Marlins manager John Boles said. ``He wants to be
a complete player. He doesn't want that infamous record.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Cubs rookie right-hander Ruben Quevedo threw 133
pitches in a complete-game win against the Dodgers last Monday. The
reason he threw so many pitches? Pitching coach Oscar Acosta had
him with only 112 pitches. ... Colorado right fielder Larry Walker
has a no-trade clause in his contract, but the Rockies may look to
move him after the season because he's owed $12.5 million a year
through 2005. But Walker didn't want to talk about being traded
because he didn't want to give the wrong impression. ``Don't make
it sound like I'm asking to be traded because I'm not,'' Walker
said. &QL;

MATTHEWS JR. USED TO BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As long as he's not playing against Barry Bonds,
Gary Matthews Jr. feels like a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always one of my favorite players when I was younger,''
Matthews said of the San Francisco Giants outfielder. ``When I play
against him, I always get a kick out of it. It's sort of a weird
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Being overwhelmed or in awe of the major-league experience is
rare, though, for the 25-year-old Granada Hills (Calif.) High
graduate, who has less than a season's worth of experience at this
level.
</P>
<P>
   As a reserve outfielder for the Chicago Cubs, he plays alongside
Sammy Sosa, but being around the game's elite was something
Matthews got used to years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tagging along with his dad, whose career included time with the
Cubs in the mid-80s, made Matthews feel comfortable in major-league
surroundings at an early age, leaving him focused and ready to work
when he became a major-leaguer himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the biggest reasons I've been able to get
over the period of being nervous or intimidated,'' Matthews said of
his dad's career. ``That's something I really didn't go through,
that adjustment period. It didn't take me as long to get over it as
maybe some of the other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around the game a while. And growing up as a kid,
you're in the clubhouse with guys like Pete Rose, Mike Schmidt,
Ryne Sandberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list goes on as far as guys my dad played with. So just
coming here with guys like Sammy Sosa or (Mark) Grace, it's
different players today, but it's the same thing. I'm not really in
awe, it's a place of business. But it's a lot of fun, it seems
normal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews appeared in 23 games last season with San Diego before
being traded to the Cubs this spring. He began the season in
Triple-A Iowa, but was recalled June 2, making him the sixth son of
a former Cub to also play for the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true for me being here,'' Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the fresh start, realizing he would probably still
be in Triple-A if he stayed in the Padres organization.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Cubs coaching staff admit they questioned
Matthews' potential when he arrived. After all, he had spent four
years at the Single-A level and had a .263 career batting average
in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing how hard Matthews works, combined with his strong arm,
speed and good range in the outfield, helped change his new
employers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary works with me more than anyone,'' said Cubs hitting coach
Jeff Pentland. ``He's a tremendous worker, he knows what it takes
to play at this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came here. I didn't realize how good of an athlete we
were getting. It'll be a while before his hitting is as good as the
rest of his game, but he's definitely improving. He has a future
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews is also encouraged by his progress. Even though he
entered this weekend's series against Cincinnati batting just .206
with four RBI, he is adjusting to changes Pentland is making in his
swing. He also has made key defensive contributions, including two
highlight-reel catches in a recent game against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good so far,'' Matthews said. ``I'm beginning to
prove I can play at this level and that I belong here. Ever since I
was kid I thought I belonged here, so it's nice to see it
happen.'' &QL;

USC TALKING BIG, READY TO BACK IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC quarterback Carson Palmer talks about
playing for the national championship. Linebacker Zeke Moreno says
the Rose Bowl is not the ultimate goal, because the Trojans want to
play in the Orange Bowl, site of college football's title game.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Paul Hackett says he's never been more excited about
a group of players, and this could be a ``special'' year.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like something straight out of the 1970s, or a tone
more appropriate from the mouths of today's Florida State players.
</P>
<P>
   But this is actually USC, today, and the attitude and
expectations are high. No one is talking like they belonged to any
of the previous four teams that went 26-22 and made just one bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   There's an unbridled optimism that hasn't been present since
1996, when, like this season, the Trojans opened the year in the
Kickoff Classic against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people on the team in their fourth and fifth
year here, and they're fed up with what happened in the past,''
senior defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik said. ``It's time to start
winning, and dominating and getting back to the Rose Bowl. We're
seeing the type of guys we have and the chemistry and what can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he feels so good about the Trojans precisely
because of the senior leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the senior group has given me the indication this team
will be different than the last two teams,'' Hackett said. ``It's
not depending on a freshman quarterback (Palmer) or a maverick wide
receiver (R. Jay Soward).''
</P>
<P>
   The players are also feeding off Hackett's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realizes what we're capable of,'' Moreno, a senior,
said. ``He's excited about the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno said he is completely prepared to defend his remarks
about the Trojans, because he has never felt so confident in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some think I'm crazy but I'm not saying it for them,'' Moreno
said. ``I'm saying it because I believe it. It's not for attention.
It's what I think we're capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who is usually low key about almost everything, thinks a
national championship is realistic. He said the Trojans' mental
outlook was part of last season's downfall, and believes the
strength of this team will be its belief in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't very confident last year,'' Palmer said.
``Things are different now. We feel pretty confident about the team
and our schedule. We want to shoot for the highest goal. It's a
solid chance.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger, of course, with such lofty predictions. If
the Trojans lose to Penn State on Aug. 27, they could lose all the
confidence and momentum they accumulated during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in 1996. The Trojans were ranked seventh in the
Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll, then lost to Penn State
24-7 and went on to a disappointing 6-6 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no similarities,'' senior Eric Denmon said. ``I see a
lot of leadership and guys busting their behinds this year. I can
remember we were ranked seventh in the nation, and guys thought
since they were seventh, they didn't have to work as hard. I think
we took that too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much bickering between the units. At that time,
we didn't have leaders. Guys were just being individual players. We
have leaders on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Moreno is taking an aggressive role to ensure
things don't go sideways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my turn to step up and take control in situations,'' he
said. ``If I see a problem, I will address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Antoine Harris has also been more vocal and Palmer
said he is willing to share responsibility because of the
importance of being the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the team has become a tighter group, spending the
summer socializing instead of going their separate ways once summer
workouts concluded.
</P>
<P>
   This is one reason for Hackett's underlying confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've teased people before and won some games and then lost
our discipline,'' Hackett said. ``But I feel there's enough
maturity with the seniors to say they have a shot to do something
and they will respond. The difference is players are talking about
how good we can be as a team. Usually you hear players say 'How
good can I be?'''
</P>
<P>
   That mindset has even permeated down to the incoming freshmen.
Although there are several high school All-Americans, there haven't
been any early displays of ego.
</P>
<P>
   `I see a lot of young guys with accolades willing to come here
with a clean slate,'' Denmon said. ``We have no individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Added strong safety Matt Grootegoed, one of the most decorated
freshmen: ``No one's cocky out here.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the Penn State game. USC is a 3-point underdog, and
if the Trojans lost, wouldn't it suck away all their bravado and
ruin the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see us reacting that way because I don't think it will
happen, whatever the outcome of the Penn State game,'' Moreno said.
``And I don't see us losing. You don't think about it. It's just
something if it happens, it happens.'' &QL;

MADDUX SHUTS DOWN LIFELESS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This high-powered offense that's carried the Dodgers
through the first two months of the season is nowhere to be found.
For the past two weeks, even rumors of how good the offense was at
one point are now unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Atlanta isn't exactly a great way to break free. Going
against Greg Maddux is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   With Maddux working magic with his fastball that tails back over
the plate _ or relatively close _ the Dodgers hitters never stood a
chance in a 4-1 loss to Atlanta on an otherwise comfortable
Saturday afternoon at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' sixth loss in seven games came in a familiar way _
with the offense doing absolutely nothing _ and the players have
absolutely no idea what to do next to break the drought. All left
fielder Gary Sheffield knows is the blame shouldn't fall on manager
Davey Johnson, whose seat gets hotter with each loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were slated to play Saturday night, but at the time
of the Dodgers' loss they dropped to six games out of first in the
National League West, the same number by which they trailed at the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers are hired and fired because of us,'' said Sheffield,
who doubled in four at-bats. ``Davey's doing his job and we're not
doing ours. He lets us play. Guys are complaining when they're not
playing and they're struggling. Let him do his job and we'll do
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Maligned Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes did his required
duty, putting the shellacking he took against Milwaukee last
weekend behind him to pitch six solid innings. Valdes (2-6) allowed
three runs (two earned) in six innings, but a lack of offense made
it moot.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (13-6) allowed seven hits in 61/3 innings and relievers
Mike Remlinger and Kerry Ligtenberg pitched 22/3 innings of hitless
relief. During a 14-game stretch in which the Dodgers are 5-9,
they're batting .227 and averaging 3.36 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we had our opportunities in the game and we didn't
capitalize,'' Dodgers center fielder Devon White said. ``It's part
of the game. You have to roll with it and hopefully we don't sink
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the energy that was once part of the clubhouse has
disappeared. White was asked if it was time to worry about falling
too far behind in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' White said. ``I'm not going to do any worrying. I'm
going to do the best I can. Sometimes these things work themselves
out and sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, though, the offense is doing very little to ease
the burden and pressure being felt by many.
</P>
<P>
   The best Dodgers chance Saturday came in the first inning, when
Mark Grudzielanek singled with one out and Sheffield doubled. But
Maddux struck out Shawn Green looking, then got Eric Karros to line
out to right field to thwart the early threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, whose lineup produced huge days regularly during
the first two months of the season, got three runners to second
base after the first inning. The only one to score was Green, on a
Karros double in the sixth that pulled the Dodgers within 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, whenever a team comes to Atlanta the topic of a
struggling offense (ital) has to (endital) turn to just how many
calls the Braves' pitchers get off of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the last guy you want to run into when you're struggling
at the plate,'' said Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley, who went 1 for 2
with two walks. ``On TV, they look like good pitches. But when
you're hitting, they're not on the plate. When I watch it go by,
it's off the plate. But whenever it comes back, it's a few inches
on the plate when it hits the catcher's glove. It's an unhittable
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring in double digits 11 times in the first 45 games,
the Dodgers have reached 10 runs three times in the past 70 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in here still believes we have an
opportunity,'' Karros said. ``I've seen a lot of frustration. I
think everyone in here believes we can get something going although
it may not appear that way from the outside.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is under fire for
his managerial style and for not producing more wins with a payroll
of $98 million.
</P>
<P>
   If things don't improve, Johnson most likely will be gone. But
he's not the only manager in the National League West in jeopardy
of losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Showalter, long-regarded as an excellent manager with an
overbearing style and a penchant for trying to re-invent the way
the game is managed, is also in trouble. And while the rumblings
have grown during the season, a column calling for his job this
week in an Arizona paper has stirred debate in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter joined the Arizona organization a year before the
Diamondbacks started playing at the major-league level and has been
integral in building the club into a perennial playoff contender,
but is now in trouble because the clubhouse and organization is
about to crumble around him.
</P>
<P>
   Word out of Arizona is that Showalter, notorious for being a
control freak, has annoyed a bunch of people throughout the
organization. He's also shown a lack of respect, and those close to
the situation say he's angered people close to Arizona CEO Jerry
Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every manager has his own style,'' Colangelo said. ``Managers
are no different than players. They are who they are. They don't
change. Some are loose, some are intense. People are who they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   And Showalter is a control freak.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks lived with it through their first few years
because, at first, they were young and building. And, lately,
because they won.
</P>
<P>
   However, now the Diamondbacks are slumping. They've fallen two
games behind San Francisco in the West despite acquiring Curt
Schilling before the trading deadline. But while Schilling won his
first three starts with Arizona, lefty Randy Johnson hasn't won
since the deal went down.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling in Arizona is if the Diamondbacks reach the
playoffs, Showalter would survive. But if things don't improve,
Showalter likely would be axed.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said Showalter has ``done a very good job,'' but he
didn't give a full endorsement of his manager's standing in the
organization, nor state that he would be back next season.
Colangelo also said the feeling around this club was very different
from the one that won 100 games last season, though they've had a
bundle of injuries to deal with this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck was hired to do a job,'' Colangelo said. ``He's done his
job to the best of his ability, and we've had a lot of success
under his management. This year has been marred by all kinds of
adversity as far as I'm concerned, in terms of injuries and so on
and so forth, which has really taken its toll. I would say that he
has done a very good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that is noticeable, because of the adversity, it
hasn't been as much fun as we had a year ago because we had one of
those years where everything was fantastic. Because we've had the
adversity this year, the atmosphere hasn't been quite the same.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Colangelo will do is decide on Showalter's future
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't need any advice from anyone. I've been around
this business too long. I think my 34 years of experience in pro
sports qualifies me to make decisions and do what I believe is
necessary or required.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feelings are kept to myself and I respond when I think it's
necessary to respond, one way or the other. Right now I'd rather
just concentrate on playing good baseball, getting healthy and
winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning games is the key part. If the Diamondbacks do it,
Showalter likely will return. Otherwise, Arizona will be looking
for its second manager. &QL;

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE LIKES ITS CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Cal State Northridge quarterback Marcus
Brady is back. The Matadors defense is being billed as an improved
unit. And the goal of winning the school's first Big Sky Conference
title _ CSUN's final chance _ is very real.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who will move to the Big West as an independent
team next season, open football practice Monday with two-a-days at
CSUN. Second-year coach Jeff Kearin couldn't be more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a better offseason or summer workout period,''
Kearin said. ``It's really been a fabulous offseason. It's been a
fabulous offseason academically, and it's been a credit to the
kids. When (last) season ended they said, `We've got to win this
championship. We're stronger, we're bigger and faster than we've
ever been.' I'm real excited to go Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   And ready to put out of his mind the NCAA sanctions brought on
by former coach Ron Ponciano. Allegations of cheating that rocked
the program were upheld over the summer by the NCAA, which banned
CSUN from postseason play for a year and put it on probation for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said he is so focused on winning the Big Sky he hasn't
yet discussed the NCAA sanctions with players. Not that it hasn't
been a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been such a hectic and disruptive and distracting
offseason,'' Kearin said. ``We've lost a couple of kids to that but
that's OK. We'll go to battle with the guys that are here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the kids are so resilient and focused as far as
keeping their eye on the ball, so to speak. We certainly can't win
a national championship, but that's all right. We can win a
conference championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors finished 6-5 last year and 4-3 in the Big Sky. On
the field, CSUN went 5-6 but Northern Arizona forfeited its win for
using an ineligible player.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's offense was explosive, averaging 450.3 yards per
game, and six starters return. Running back Jaumal Bradley _ who
ran for 932 yards and seven touchdowns _ is gone, leaving the
position up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore wide receiver Drew Amerson, who had a team-leading 71
receptions, figures to be Brady's favorite target again.
</P>
<P>
   Brady passed for 3,326 yards and 24 touchdowns but also threw 15
interceptions. Kearin believes this year's offense _ despite a
young and inexperienced line _ can be even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady's arguably one of the best quarterbacks in the
country,'' Kearin said. ``Probably his biggest improvement is his
feeling of leadership on the team. He's more of a quiet leader, not
a screamer. But everybody's looking to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was less than careful with the ball _ (15) turnovers.
That's devastating. He feels he has to throw fewer interceptions.
That goes without saying. But to be honest, I take a lot of
responsibility for the turnovers. I inherited the group two weeks
before the season started, and I didn't have a firm grasp of the
offense. We've tweaked and adjusted and changed some things, and I
understand it better. We'll be more efficient as a coaching
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   And hopefully for the Matadors, more effective on defense. The
defense has just three returning starters in camp, but Kearin is
impressed with the speed of rookies and transfers. Newcomers
started camp Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cos Abercrombie returns to the linebacker corps, which Kearin
calls the most improved unit on either side of the ball. The
Matadors surrendered 431.1 yards per game last season, a trend
Kearin hopes to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we're certainly much more talented and much
faster as a defensive unit,'' Kearin said. ``We have a scheme in
place that is really effective. ... The young kids have developed,
and I think Ron Ponciano and ourselves have recruited some good,
young defensive players. We were not very strong last year as a
defensive front. We've filled some holes, and young guys have
developed.'' &QL;

HEALTHY DREIFORT MEANS EVERYTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson has done his best to
protect Darren Dreifort. He's limited Dreifort's innings and rested
him a few extra days when off-days made it possible, all in hopes
of keeping him strong during the last month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers will pay particular attention to how Dreifort
performs during the last month of the season. And if he performs.
If the tough right-hander doesn't have arm problems and is able to
finish strong, the Dodgers will try hard to re-sign the
free-agent-to-be, sources said. Dreifort's eligible for free agency
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to the Dodgers' decision, more so than the way
Dreifort performs over the final 47 games, is his health.
</P>
<P>
   The club has already decided Dreifort can be the dominating
starter that so many scouts predicted he would be. He enters his
start today against Atlanta with a career-high five-game winning
streak and a 2.67 ERA since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from his two months of inconsistency earlier in
the season, when he was 1-6 with a 7.03 ERA in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``His delivery is more consistent,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``He's repeating the same delivery, which allows
him to have better control and better command. It looks like he's
found it. His stuff has always been there, but he's found a
consistent delivery that allows him to throw the ball with more
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who is 9-7 with a 4.51 ERA, has gone through these
spells of dominance before, but the the Dodgers' brass remains
guarded about his durability. Johnson thought about pushing
Dreifort's next start back to Tuesday, giving him a few more days'
rest because the Dodgers had Thursday off.
</P>
<P>
   However, after consulting with Dreifort, the decision was made
to start him today and go with right-hander Matt Herges in Florida
on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure (Dreifort) was feeling good,'' Johnson
said. ``Sometimes he won't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season Johnson said he would try to limit Dreifort
to between 90 and 100 pitches as a precaution for his arm. In each
of the past two seasons _ Dreifort's first two as a starter with
the Dodgers _ he experienced arm troubles and didn't pitch for much
of September.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort is also nearing a career high in starts. Today will
mark his 23rd of the season. He established his career best last
season with 29. Dreifort's career high is only 180 innings, which
he achieved in 1998. He's thrown 131 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   2001 SCHEDULE: Major-league clubs have received a tentative
schedule for the 2001 season, and plenty of them are unhappy with
it. Include the Dodgers in that mix.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule has the Dodgers opening the season April 2 in
Milwaukee, then traveling back to Los Angeles for their home
opener, a baseball source said. It would also mean the Dodgers
would open up Milwaukee's new ballpark. The Brewers, in turn, would
then go on the road after the one game.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dodgers and Milwaukee have expressed displeasure at the
schedule, but it might be tough to get around, the source said. A
by-product of the unbalanced schedule next season is that teams
will have to stop in a city for one game. The tentative schedule
also calls for Atlanta to play one game in Cincinnati to begin the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also continuing to explore options of playing
exhibition games outside the United States before the regular
season begins. One of the areas being researched by the Dodgers is
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Because switch-hitting Devon White was 4 for 14
with a homer and two RBI against Atlanta right-hander Greg Maddux,
he got the start in center field. The left-handed-hitting Tom
Goodwin, who's platooning with White in center field, was 0 for 8
against Maddux. ... Third baseman Adrian Beltre was fine despite
getting hit in the head with the ball on a stolen base in the
second inning. &QL;

HEY, LET'S BREAK UP THE YANKEES LOVEFEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Come on, together we can do this. We need to
do this.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, life just hasn't been the same since the Yankees
became so, so ... (ital) respectable (endital).
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that hurt. Growing up in my little Southern California
tract home, we were taught never to use the word ``hate,'' unless
of course referring to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Then all manner of vile, repulsive vitriol was not only
acceptable, but absolutely encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking the damn Yankees. They were just so New York. Like
the entire baseball world began and ended in pinstripes. The
original ``best team money could buy.'' Team Smug.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they had this irritating habit of beating the
snot out of the Dodgers every World Series.
</P>
<P>
   One of the truly great moments in Los Angeles sports history
came when the Dodgers not only beat the Yankees in the 1963 World
Series, but swept them in four games. It still warms the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Then when the Dodgers became good again and finally got past the
Big Red Machine, who was there to thwart them the first two times
they reached the Fall Classic but the Bronx Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   Now they brought all kinds of new reasons to despise them. They
were owned by George M. Steinbrenner III, who offered a
never-before-seen personal catalog of egomania.
</P>
<P>
   His free-agency spending spree brought Reggie Jackson, the King
of Pompous. Some dictators were easier to love. It was always close
who offered the most disdain, you for Reggie, or Reggie for you.
OK, Reggie for you.
</P>
<P>
   They were managed, depending on the month, by hard-living Billy
Martin, a Napoleonic creature who always walked around like he was
looking for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   These were golden days for Yankees detesting. They made it so
easy. Lord, I miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Because now the Yankees are again America's dominant baseball
team, and what is up? They've won three of the past four World
Series. They are ripe for the ripping, and instead are almost
beloved.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very wrong. America is missing out. We need someone
in a black hat. We crave a bad guy. It's hard enough we don't have
the Soviets to get worked up over anymore, but now the Yankees are
admired?
</P>
<P>
   Willie Randolph, the longtime Yankee, brief Dodger and current
Yankees third-base coach, maintains the country remains full of
those eager to vilify the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may hate us, but right now you don't want to show your
face,'' Randolph said. ``You only talk trash when you can get away
with it. You can't do too much cracking when we're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, that's exactly when you're supposed to have your fill of
N.Y. This is when you need to dust off your finest anti-Yankee
jibes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we practically get testimonials. Where is the
tradition? Where is the venom? All across the land, fans who once
jeered the Yankees, embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' said Angels coach Alfredo Griffin. ``Times
change.''
</P>
<P>
   To wit: These Yankees are nice guys. They willingly play their
roles. Their egos are in check. They put the team ahead of the
individual. They don't always overwhelm you with power, but do all
the little things right. They are a real team.
</P>
<P>
   Their leaders are Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter and Tino
Martinez, pillars of the baseball community. They're managed by Joe
Torre, an honest, helpful, caring man.
</P>
<P>
   This is Steinbrenner's team?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time people really hated the Yankees was when they
had Reggie,'' said Irv Kaze, a former Yankees public relations
director who now hosts a sports show on KIEV-AM in Los Angeles.
``These really aren't people you dislike.
</P>
<P>
   ``People respect them for what they've done. They're not
controversial. None of them makes any news off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Making this animosity thing more difficult is that the Yankees
have had to undergo more than their share of personal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees won the first of their three most recent titles
in 1996, Torre lost one brother to a heart attack and had another
undergo heart surgery during the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, outfielder Darryl Strawberry came down with colon
cancer and three players _ Paul O'Neill, Scott Brosius and Luis
Sojo _ lost their fathers. Last year, Torre battled prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees have pulled at our hearts, not ripped them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to respect the character of this team,'' Randolph
said. ``You need individuals to hate. This team really doesn't have
anyone to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Steinbrenner did add Jose Canseco lately, so at least
there's somebody to boo again. It's a start.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty to get worked up over. They remain the
ultimate example of big-market excess. Their payroll is now a
record-breaking $112.3 million. Players keep going down, and
Steinbrenner just adds more bodies _ David Justice, Denny Neagle,
Glenallen Hill, Luis Polonia, Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   And they blend in and keep winning. It's absolutely disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of this group is pretty flexible when it comes to
change,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable how they extend their arms to anyone new and
make them feel welcome. On most clubs, new people have to prove
themselves. They're very unusual, very unique in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Very irritating, when you're trying to work up a good
anti-Yankees lather. Maybe the whole anti-Manhattan thing has
become passe.
</P>
<P>
   You seldom even hear a New York accent around here anymore,
unless you're trying to listen to L.A. sports radio.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, but it's not too late. It doesn't matter if Williams plays
the classical guitar, Jeter calls his mother every day or Martinez
helps little old ladies across the street.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Yankees. You are not allowed to admire them. It's
un-American. Work on it. &QL;

SO FAR, CAMPO FLAWLESS IN REPLACING THE HAT AND HAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hair has been tinted a bit to take out the gray, plus
cropped shorter. When laser surgery wasn't possible, the old
moon-eyed frame on his glasses gave way to designer snazziness. His
ride of pride had been a Trans-Am. Now it's a Cadillac. And for
street-wear, the wardrobe went from off the rack at any-old-place
to the best Neiman-Marcus has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   A down-home guy from Connecticut is promoted to his dream job,
and what's the first thing everybody attempts to do?
</P>
<P>
   Make him ``look'' like the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo is not alone. Makeover artists are in big demand
these days. ``W'' is being told not to smile. To look presidential.
Al is being told to smile more. To show a personality.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, has already assumed a higher office than those
two.
</P>
<P>
   So have you gotten cozy yet with the idea that he's now the man?
Can you come to grips with Campo suddenly holding the same job that
once belonged to The Hat and The Hair?
</P>
<P>
   His football credentials are in perfect order, but take another
look tonight. When the TV cameras zoom in on the Texas Stadium
sidelines, could you pick Campo out of a crowd of fifty-something
sportswriters or at a reunion of former Central Connecticut State
shortstops?
</P>
<P>
   Campo's best friend growing up was John Ellis, a member of the
Rangers in the 1970s. To this day, Ellis is considered the toughest
player ever in Arlington, plus he had the ``look.'' If Hollywood
had been asked to cast the head coach of the Cowboys, it would be
John Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jerry Jones gave us Ellis' little pal.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, how has Campo handled the assignment thus far?
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawlessly,'' was the answer from Brad Sham last week in
Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   That's just an opinion, although as a longtime Cowboys radio
voice, Sham speaks with qualifications. He knows where all the
bodies are buried, including his own after Sham once told the truth
(on the air) about a former pseudo head coach.
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, the football stuff is by far the easiest part
of this job. Between ``handling'' Jones, and the largest army of
media in professional sports, and the largest collection of spoiled
fandom in pro sports, and the blimp-sized egos in the locker room,
Campo can also keep everybody happy by winning a minimum of 12
games a season and going to three Super Bowls in the next four
seasons. Oh, yeah. It'd be best to win at least two of those Super
Bowls. And have a darn good alibi for the third.
</P>
<P>
   Given the job back in January to something less than rave
reviews, Campo has been laying down his head coaching foundation
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Without a game being played, how does Campo currently stack up?
</P>
<P>
   Flawlessly. (There's an echo in here).
</P>
<P>
   Without a game being played, this has been a perfect debut in
all areas. No names, please, but I know one guy who didn't think
Campo should have gotten the job, and now the same guy screams at
peaheads who wonder why Campo doesn't ``look'' like the head coach
of the Cowboys is supposed to look? What does being short and
normal have to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   How tall is short? I don't know. I never asked Campo for his
height when he was defensive coordinator. Why is it important now?
</P>
<P>
   This just in from the Cowboys' media relations department:
</P>
<P>
   Campo is as tall or taller than the winning coaches of the first
four Super Bowls (Lombardi, Lombardi, Ewbank and Stram).
</P>
<P>
   This just in from Troy Aikman:
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you read the new book about Lombardi?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it. Part of it ties in with what Dave is going through.
It took Lombardi forever to get his first head coaching job because
it was said he didn't project the presence of a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Campo?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has established himself as the leader of this football
team, if that's what you mean,'' Aikman said. ``If we win, Dave is
going to look like a head coach and I'm going to look like a
quarterback. If we don't win, both of us will look like...''
</P>
<P>
   Valid points, Troy.
</P>
<P>
   But while they dress him, groom him and put him in Cadillacs,
Campo just grins, good-naturedly. He also knows what you are
thinking. He knows winning can change your mind, and he knows Brad
Pitt wouldn't survive around here without the winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me I should now attempt to have the conservative
look of a successful executive,'' said Campo, shrugging. Actually,
it was his kids who ordered dad to ditch the out-of-style eye-wear,
and his wife wanted the shorter hair. The other look was fine for
one of the best defensive coordinators in the NFL. But as the head
coach of the Dallas Cowboys, well...
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing, however, is changing about me,'' Campo said. ``I'm
always going to be the same ol' guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Attaboy, coach. Stand tall.

RARELY USED RULE SETS NASCAR LINEUP AT WATKINS GLEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Bobby Labonte has the pole. Brett Bodine
figures he and Scott Pruett got the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Winston Cup interlopers Ron Fellows and Todd Bodine
landed two controversial starting spots yesterday at Watkins Glen
International, where a second day of unsettled upstate New York
weather prompted NASCAR to invoke a seldom-used rule to fill out
the grid for today's Global Crossing at The Glen.
</P>
<P>
   Postponed by showers Friday afternoon, Winston Cup pole
qualifying was 11 cars deep yesterday morning when showers began
pelting the back portion of the 2.45-mile, 11-turn road course.
Anticipating a lengthy additional delay, and mindful of a TV
commitment to a Busch North Series race, NASCAR officials canceled
the remainder of Cup qualifying and went to the rulebook.
</P>
<P>
   The starting lineup for today's 90-lap/220.5-mile event was
determined by Section 9-5 of that book. The top 35 positions were
set by car owner's points, meaning native Texan Labonte and points
runner-up Dale Jarrett will be sharing the front row in the cars
owned by Joe Gibbs and Robert Yates, respectively. Section 9-5
provides that the 36th position be awarded to a past Cup champion _
a spot filled by three-time champion Darrell Waltrip for owner Carl
Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Article No. 8 of Section 9-5 provides that the next
positions be assigned according to the random draw for qualifying.
That opened the door for Cup regulars Mike Bliss, Kyle Petty and
Rick Mast, who drives for Texan A.J. Foyt. Also making the cut at
40th via the draw was road-racing specialist Fellows, in a
Chevrolet owned by Cup regular Joe Nemechek, and Busch Grand
National driver Todd Bodine, 43rd and last in the No. 34 I Love NY
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Purely by the luck of the draw, Fellows and Todd Bodine knocked
Cup regulars Pruett and Brett Bodine out of the starting lineup.
And neither of the latter was a happy camper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My race team commits to attempt to race every weekend in the
Winston Cup Series,'' said an agitated Bodine, whose wife, Diane,
owns the No. 11 Ralphs Supermarkets Ford Taurus. ``Evidently, that
doesn't mean anything, because there are teams that are going to
start this race that haven't even attempted to make one race this
year. I just do not see the logic in that procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine is 38th in points, having qualified for 16 of 20 races to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to start this race because I wasn't lucky in
what number I drew in my qualifying order,'' Bodine said outside
his hauler. ``How can luck of the draw override hard work,
determination, dedication and commitment to something?''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine's primary sponsorship reportedly is worth $5 million a
year. That is only half of what Tide reportedly is paying to fund
rookie Pruett in the No. 32 Tide Ford owned by Cal Wells III.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me. I've been here 33 years and I'm out of here,''
said veteran Dave Marcis, who has only qualified for 10 races this
season but was a victim of the draw. ``Cal Wells, what's he got on
the line? He's out of here. I'm sure the CEO or whoever's in charge
of their sponsorship will call up NASCAR next week and ask, `How is
this place run?' I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Pruett, 39th in points but coming off his first
career top-10 finish at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a rookie, I don't understand all the ins and outs of the
rules,'' Pruett said, ``but I think NASCAR should take a close look
at that rule. If you base it on speed and you're not fast enough to
get into the race, fair enough; you don't deserve to be there. But
if you are fast enough to get into the race and you've been
committed to the sport all year long, and are going to be committed
to the sport like we are for the rest of the season, we shouldn't
be one of those guys going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Road-racing hired guns Boris Said and Brian Simo also were sent
packing. But not before Said, driving a car entered by Cup regular
Jimmy Spencer, vented his frustration to Mike Helton, NASCAR's
senior vice president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mad at NASCAR,'' said Said, who posted the fastest speeds
in both practices in the No. 23 Ford. ``I went up to Mike Helton
and I said, `Hey, you're killing me over here. I've got 300 people
from Federated Auto Parts coming, one of the best sponsors I've
ever had.' They probably made the right decision, but I'm still mad
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton said he understood the angst of the five drivers who will
miss the season's second and final road race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the procedure is laid out in the rulebook, and everybody
knows going into the year what the procedure is,'' Helton said.
``We tried the best we could to qualify, but circumstances wouldn't
permit us to do that. Then somebody goes home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can happen anywhere. We've had our share of
\Rweather\S problems everywhere, including Texas.'' nn

IRWINDALE BREAKS GROUND FOR DRAGSTRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Irwindale is once again Drag City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 23 years after Irwindale Raceway was closed to make room
for the Miller Brewery, officials of two-year-old Irwindale
Speedway broke ground Saturday for an eighth-mile drag strip that
will be used primarily for National Hot Rod Association junior
dragsters and street-legal cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Irwindale Dragstrip will be the first Southern California
drag racing facility built since 1974 and the first NHRA-sanctioned
facility since the now-defunct Orange County Raceway was
constructed in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a dream come true for us,'' said Irwindale
Speedway CEO Jim Williams, who was joined at the ground-breaking
ceremony by NHRA founder Wally Parks and other racing dignitaries.
``When we build Irwindale we kind of had something like (a drag
strip) in the back of our minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody asks, 'Is this an afterthought?' It certainly wasn't
an afterthought, we just didn't think we would be able to pull it
off as fast as we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip, half the length of the traditional quarter-mile, will
be located on the southeastern corner of the track property. It
will cover roughly 1,400 feet from a burnout area to shutdown area.
The track surface will consist of a 220-foot concrete launching
pad, which is used for increased traction. There will be
grandstands for 1,000 spectators and a timing and scoring tower.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected to be ready by the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a dream come true,'' Parks said. ``We have waited
so many years to add a drag-racing facility to this part of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we once had about a dozen tracks operating (in the
area), we now have two _ Pomona Raceway and (Los Angeles County
Raceway) in Palmdale. So there is just a tremendous need for young
people who like acceleration racing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Irwindale Dragstrip comes into play. Following
an agreement earlier this year between NHRA, Los Angeles County
Fairplex officials and La Verne city officials, the NHRA
street-legal program will be nonexistent at Pomona Raceway
beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at Pomona wasn't part of our plan,'' Williams
said. ``It's ironic that they are closing (the street legal
program), so we're going to fill the void.''
</P>
<P>
   And Parks, who founded the Glendora-based NHRA in 1951, doesn't
think using an eighth-mile circuit will hurt. In fact, he thinks it
may enhance the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approve and am in favor of the eighth-mile racing distance
as opposed to the standard quarter-mile,'' Parks said. ``I think
eighth-mile racing is going to be more and more of a popular form
of competition. And this one at Irwindale will provide our best
chance for a showcase.'' &QL;

TEUSCHER WINS 200 MEDLEY, AND A SECOND TRIP TO THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ By her sophomore year of high school, Cristina
Teuscher was an elite international swimmer. Her graduation present
in 1996 was a gold medal in the 800-meter freestyle relay at the
Atlanta Olympics. She could have attended any of the major swimming
powers, such as Stanford or Southern Cal, which were more than
willing to give her a full-scholarship ride through college.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Teuscher chose to stay close to home, attending
Columbia University and shelling out $34,000 a year. Do not worry
about cost, her father, Enrique Teuscher, a psychiatrist in New
Rochelle, N.Y., had told her. Just be happy. So she remained close
to her parents, balancing the academic rigors of an Ivy League
education with the demands of a high-level swimming career, minus
the pressures of having to justify her scholarship by leading her
team to national collegiate titles.
</P>
<P>
   She chose a road not often taken in the swimming world, and her
career has benefited demonstrably. Teuscher now has a degree in
psychology, four individual collegiate titles and yet another spot
in the Olympics, having qualified Saturday night for the Summer
Games in Sydney, Australia, by winning the 200-meter individual
medley at the Olympic trials in 2 minutes 13.36 seconds, her career
best by nearly a second. Gabrielle Rose, who competed for Brazil at
the 1996 Games, finished second Saturday night in 2:14.95.
</P>
<P>
   Teuscher had been a favorite last Wednesday in the 400-meter
individual medley, but apparent complacency and tentativeness took
her out of the race immediately and she finished third. Only two
swimmers qualify for the Olympics in each event. Saturday night,
not wearing a high-tech body suit because it constricts her
breaststroke, she swam much more aggressively, drawing away
steadily from her competition and winning by more than a second and
a half, a huge victory in a race that can be decided by hundredths
of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to prove to myself that I could get up after
being down,'' the 22-year-old Teuscher said.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200-meter butterfly, Tom Malchow of St. Paul,
Minn., was nearly a half second faster than his world-record pace
after 150 meters, but he perhaps went out too fast. He still won
easily in 1:56.87, but did not threaten record of 1:55.18. In
finishing second in 1:57.48, 15-year-old Michael Phelps of
Baltimore became the youngest American male swimmer to qualify for
the Olympics since 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can put together two great swims and dominate
this event,'' Malchow said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Benko of Elkhart, Ind., won the women's 200-meter
freestyle in 2:00.45, ahead of Owen Rada (2:00.54) of Arlington,
Va. In the semifinals of the men's 100-meter freestyle, Neil
Walker, who finished second on Friday in the 100-meter backstroke,
posted the fastest time of 48.55 seconds. Gary Hall Jr., the 1996
Olympic silver medalist, posted the second-fastest time in 48.92
seconds. Hall has been found to have diabetes since the Atlanta
Games, and was an uncertain presence before the trials began. He is
now a serious contender in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 200 individual medley, Teuscher said that her
choice to remain close to home for college had been long validated
and did not depend on a victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people go off to college and have difficulty balancing
academics and the responsibilities of a college scholarship,''
Teuscher said. ``They are away from home and their defenses are
always up. I'd rather be in a comfortable setting, around people I
know who would give me unconditional love. I could let my guard
down.''
</P>
<P>
   She won the first two collegiate swimming titles for Columbia in
1998, then stunned her competitors by leaving the national meet
early to go home and study. While in school, she trained in the
morning at Columbia with Coach Diana Caskey and in the afternoons
at Lehman College in the Bronx with John Collins, her longtime
coach at the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont. Grants from the United
States Olympic Committee and the national swimming federation
helped defray tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the best of both worlds with a female and male coach,''
the 6-foot-1-inch, 150-pound Teuscher said. ``I hate to generalize,
but a woman coach seems more in tune about how I feel. I'm an
emotional person. John really knew what I needed physically to be
in shape. The mixture was perfect for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Caskey said, ``I think this allowed her to develop her own sense
of self-confidence and maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Atlanta Games, Teuscher, then 18, said she was in a
``catatonic state,'' unnerved by the crowds of 18,000 people at
Georgia Tech. After winning the 200-meter freestyle at the 1996
trials and finishing second in the 400 freestyle, her best
individual finish at the Olympics was sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like a scared rabbit,'' Collins said. ``Some people
step up in those kind of situations. With Cristina, it didn't work
that way at all. I'm proud that she was able to recover to get a
gold medal in the relay.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending Columbia provided a sort of protective cocoon, Collins
said, allowing Teuscher to rebuild her confidence and to gain a
broader world view in a rigorous academic environment. Team
swimming was stressed, relieving the pressure of individual
accomplishment. Four years later, she entered the 2000 trials
relaxed and self-assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said I looked like a five-year-old on TV, ready to
cry,'' Teuscher said with a laugh about her performance in Atlanta.
``I felt all the pressure on my shoulders. I think I've learned to
brush that off and just get in the pool and swim. I've definitely
come a long way since then. The secret to it is to be relaxed and
have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She may have been too relaxed in the 400 individual medley after
a superb early season, Collins said. He said the third-place finish
had the effect of waking up a somnolent Teuscher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she concentrated enough to be to do what she had
to do to win,'' Collins said. ``It was a wakeup call. Everyone
needs that once in a while, but it came at an inopportune time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday night's race, Teuscher spoke to Jenny Thompson,
a five-time Olympic gold medalist, and to Summer Sanders, who won a
silver medal in the 200 individual medley and a bronze in the 400
at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. She also covered
herself with ladybug stickers as sort of good-luck charms.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson told her to remain controlled and Sanders said, ``Just
have fun and go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you need to hear that from people beside your family
and coach,'' Teuscher said. ``I was really more aggressive. I
wasn't taking any chances.''

<HEADLINE>
ERVIN SPRINTING INTO LIMELIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Anthony Ervin showed why he is on the short list
to earn a U.S. berth to Sydney in the 50-meter freestyle on
Saturday. There was just one glitch. He chose to declare his
Olympic candidacy during the 100-meter freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   After clocking a sizzling 23.19 on the first lap of his 100
preliminary race _ an eye-popping 0.14 seconds under Russian
Alexander Popov's world-record split _ the Hart High of Newhall,
Calif., product had to gut out another lap before he could accept
handshakes and congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ervin touched the wall in a personal-best 49.75, he
was in no shape to stump. He was so overwrought, he got sick to his
stomach while slumped on the steps of the warmdown pool at the
IUPUI Natatorium.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his swift ascent from 1999 CIF champion to 2000 Olympic
hopeful gave him the bends; nearly an hour after his first race the
Valencia, Calif., native still looked a little green around the
gills.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, the face of sprinting's future looked more
steely than sickly. Ervin, 19, who will begin his sophomore year at
California next week unless the Olympics happen to beckon, swam a
much more controlled race _ and went even faster.
</P>
<P>
   He took the first 50 out in 23.56 on his way to a 49.37, which
qualified him fourth for tonight's final. Truth to tell, Ervin
probably would have gone faster in the morning, fatigue and all, if
he hadn't been such a good sport.
</P>
<P>
   On the second lap, he moved to the side of his lane so his
teammate, Jon Olsen, who was swimming in the next lane, could draft
off him. Olsen finished in 50.10, barely qualifying for a second
swim, then quipped, ``I told Anthony I owe him cab fare.''
</P>
<P>
   Such esprit de corps is commonplace wherever fast men are found.
In contrast to the U.S.'s top women's sprinters, who appear
reluctant to embrace one another literally or metaphorically, this
country's male sprinters are as friendly as fraternity brothers
(Phi Zoomin Groomin?).
</P>
<P>
   Top qualifier Neil Walker, whose speed has rocketed him to
Olympic medal contention in the 100 backstroke, the 100 freestyle
and the 100 butterfly, went out of his way to introduce himself to
Ervin after the prelims Saturday. Later he went on about how he
welcomed _ not resented, not loathed, but hailed _ the challenge
Ervin's presence will provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw his NCAA performances and his swims leading up to this
meet and they were very impressive,'' said Walker, who flirted with
the American record in his semifinal heat before settling for a
personal best of 48.55. ``It's great seeing young kids like
Anthony. We need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinting in the U.S. needs something. The races that Robin
Leamy, Tom Jager and Matt Biondi once kept on a very short leash
have since run away to Russia and South Africa and Holland and
Italy and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr., the top U.S. performer last year in the 50,
ranked only sixth in the event globally. Walker was the highest
U.S. swimmer in the 100 freestyle world rankings at fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Ervin's meteoric rise? His coach credits the very
fast company he is keeping. Ervin has been training this summer in
Phoenix with 10 other world-class sprinters. ``The World Team,'' as
they call themselves, are the swimming equivalent of UCLA coach
John Smith's ``Handling Speed Intelligently'' coterie of Maurice
Greene, Jon Drummond and Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
   The group is coached by ex-USC standout Mike Bottom, an honorary
1980 Olympian in the 100 butterfly. Membership is by invitation
only. Rumor has it that more than one Olympian has petitioned to
join the group and been turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin's entree was his NCAA championships debut this spring. He
won the 50 and 100 freestyles and showed an upside so conspicuous
he gained easy admission to the training lanes occupied by the
likes of U.S. Olympians Olsen and Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen and Hall collected four gold medals, two silvers and a
bronze between them at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. A
swimmer can be pulled along to greatness, trying to keep up with
the likes of them every day at practice.
</P>
<P>
   That would appear to be the case with Ervin, who didn't crack
the top-25 in the 50 or 100 freestyles in the U.S. rankings in
1999. Going into this meet, he was seventh in the world in the 50
freestyle (second in the U.S.) and fifth nationally in the 100
freestyle and had a short-course meters world record to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in a group like ours,'' said Hall, who is making
a comeback after being diagnosed with diabetes 16 months ago, ``you
have this sense of, 'If he can do it, I can do it, too.' It really
enables you to find your limits and push yourself to those
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of relay considerations, the top six finishers in
tonight's 100 final will earn Olympic berths. If today is not
Ervin's coronation, his day is coming. Hall is convinced of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can expect a lot of great things from Anthony,'' Hall
said. ``He's still learning. When he does gain a little experience,
he's going to be tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ervin reminds Nort Thornton, the head coach at Cal, of another
sprinter he worked with a few years back. A guy by the name of
Biondi.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi also didn't pop up on U.S. Swimming's radar until after
he enrolled at Cal. Like Biondi, ``Anthony has an exceptional feel
for the water,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   So did he expect Ervin to come this far, this fast? Thornton
shook his head emphatically. ``He was talented, obviously,''
Thornton said, ``but I didn't really think he was (ital) that
(endital) talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Ervin will try to win over a few more people. His
candidacy is definitely picking up steam. &QL;

SCIOSCIA SHUFFLES ANGELS' LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With an eye toward beefing up production
against left-handed pitching, Angels manager Mike Scioscia gave his
lineup a good shuffle Saturday night, the most notable change the
shift of third baseman Troy Glaus to the No.2 spot for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll give us a little boost against left-handed pitching,''
Scioscia said before the Angels went up against New York Yankees
lefty Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No.2 hole is a lot different in the American League (which
employs the designated hitter) than it is in the National League
(where pitchers generally bat ninth),'' Scioscia explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, Troy is both a table-setter and a run producer,
and this gets him up there in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who started the night hitting .273 with a team-leading 32
home runs and 70 RBI, has hit No.6 in the lineup in 102 games, No.5
in eight games and No.4 in three games. But never No.2.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia also shifted right fielder Tim Salmon from the clean-up
spot, where he'd started 108 games, to No.3 for just the third
time, and moved first baseman Mo Vaughn from third to fourth for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get caught up in who's batting fourth, fifth, sixth,
whatever,'' Scioscia said. ``It's who's hitting behind or in front
of someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled a little against left-handers with our run
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, a right-handed batter, has hit lefties well _ .355 going
into Saturday night's game _ and so has center fielder Garret
Anderson, a left-handed batter (.353). But Vaughn was hitting only
.199 against lefties, and Salmon .216.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo isn't close to his recent career numbers against
left-handers,'' said Scioscia, noting that Vaughn hit .336 against
left-handers last year. ``You rarely see that much dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to juggle some things.''
</P>
<P>
   STRESS NOT ALL BAD: Disabled Angels left-hander Jarrod Washburn
is treating the diagnosis of his sore left shoulder _ a stress
fracture _ as a good news, bad news situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's welcome news,'' Washburn said. ``No surgery.
The biggest thing was finding out what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn is on the Angels' disabled list for the third time this
season. He came off the DL on Monday night to start against the
Chicago White Sox. By the end of the night he was back on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll be able to come back and help the club this
season,'' said Washburn, who's 7-2 _ tied with reliever Shigetoshi
Hasegawa for most wins on the staff _ with a 3.74 ERA. ``As soon as
the pain goes away the doctors say I can pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, right now I'm pretty much doing nothing. I can't even
play catch yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Tim Belcher is also cautiously optimistic,
explaining, ``I feel like I'm on the mend.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is disabled because of a strained flexor muscle, which
was operated on in December. He threw well in the bullpen Friday,
said he felt fine Saturday and plans on throwing again before this
evening's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No date, no time ... we'll see,'' is how the 38-year-old
Belcher left it.
</P>
<P>
   RELIEF HARDER TO COME BY: The loss of Angels reliever Mike
Fuyrie because of inflammation in his right elbow leaves the
bullpen on the wobbly side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big hit,'' Scioscia said of Fuyrie, who faced two
batters Friday night before coming out. ``He's been a pleasant
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuyrie appeared in 25 games and had a 2.28 ERA, best on the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said the most likely scenario to replace Fuyrie is the
combination of Juan Alvarez, Lou Pote and Eric Weaver, who was
summoned from Triple-A Edmonton to take Fuyrie's spot on the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY'S IN TOWN: Former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda dropped by
the ballpark and had quite a reunion _ in both clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, the Angels' manager, and three of his coaches, Mickey
Hatcher, Ron Roenicke and Alfredo Griffin, all played for Lasorda,
and so did Yankees infielder Jose Vizcaino and Yankees coach Willie
Randolph. Lasorda also visited with his longtime pal, Yankees coach
Don Zimmer, and onetime managerial rival Joe Torre, the Yankees'
pilot, as well as former Yankees and Angels great Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   No word whether Lasorda talked Reggie into playing for the U.S.
Olympic team, which Lasorda will manage. &QL;

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 5 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

RUNNING BACKS ACTIVE IN TROJANS' SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC coach Paul Hackett wanted to emphasize the
running game in Saturday's first football scrimmage at UC Irvine,
and if one thing is apparent early, there will be plenty of
substituting in the backfield this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans alternated sophomore Sultan McCullough, junior
Malaefou MacKenzie and senior Petros Papadakis in the 84-play
scrimmage, and each had their moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the deepest position on the team,'' Hackett said.
``We're not going to be a team that has two backs and just plays
two backs. We want to play three guys and hopefully wear a team
down by bringing in a fresh guy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough had 85 yards in 12 carries, including a 48-yard run.
MacKenzie had 35 yards in seven carries while Papadakis had 40
yards in seven carries and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all did well,'' running backs coach Kennedy Pola said.
``That just makes it harder (to pick a starter). But I'm glad to be
going with a full load rather than no depth at all.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough would seem to be the likely starter, but Pola said he
would like to assess the tailbacks after the first two or three
games. And even if McCullough did start, MacKenzie could see more
playing time because of his value as a receiver and power runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that will play no matter what is Malaefou,'' Pola
said. ``Because he is so key in different personnel (formations).''
</P>
<P>
   Even true freshman Chris Howard played Saturday and had 16 yards
in five carries.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Carson Palmer had a solid scrimmage, completing
eight of 14 passes for 135 yards. Senior Mike Van Raaphorst
completed six of seven passes for 50 yards and a touchdown, while
freshman Matt Cassel of Chatsworth was 4 for 12 for 33 yards with
an interception by sophomore Kevin Arbet.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage did seem to raise the stock of several players.
Notably, junior Faasea Mailo seems to have taken the lead over
freshman Jacob Rogers for the starting right tackle position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a heck of a week,'' Hackett said. ``He might have a
little bit of an edge at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   And junior David Newbury is the solid frontrunner in the kicking
battle, after going 4 for 5 in the scrimmage with a long of 47
yards. Freshman John Wall of Birmingham High was 3 for 5 with a
long of 44, and senior David Bell was 1 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Newbury took a step ahead,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   If any freshman made an impression, it was strong safety Matt
Grootegoed, who made six tackles, including several hard hits that
drew gasps from the 1,000 or so fans.
</P>
<P>
   Grootegoed knocked Howard out of the game with a strong hit,
although Howard later returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability to absorb our defense in a week is remarkable,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Many key players did not participate in the scrimmage to nurse
minor injuries, including wide receiver Kareem Kelly, linebacker
Markus Steele, tight end Antoine Harris, strong safety Troy
Polamalu, defensive tackles Ennis Davis and Ryan Nielsen and
defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed. It's anticipated they will
return Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Zeke Moreno played only one series so Hackett could
look at other players at his position.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Trevor Roberts is expected to be out this week
with a sprained foot. Freshman Lenny Vandermade will fill in until
Roberts returns.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Harris, the tight end position received increased
exposure, as sophomore Doyal Butler and freshmen Gregg Guenther
(Taft) and Alex Holmes (Harvard-Westlake) all caught passes.
Guenther had a scrimmage-high three receptions for 42 yards,
including an 8-yard touchdown pass from Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   In a familiar note to last season, the Trojans had 12
penalties. &QL;

   (For release Sunday, Aug. 20)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; LONG REMEMBER &LR;  By MacKinlay Kantor. (Forge/Tom Doherty,
$14.95.) In this Civil War novel, Kantor tells the story of a man
who tries to live as a pacifist in, of all places, Gettysburg, Pa.,
but is inexorably drawn into the fighting. This is ``a very fine
book,'' Peter Monro Jack wrote in The New York Times Book Review in
1934, ``a novel that tastes and smells of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The war's Washington front is examined in  &UR; ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A
Press Portrait &LR; , edited by Herbert Mitgang (Fordham University,
$19.95). The anthology, with a new introduction, draws on more than
100 newspapers and periodicals from the United States and Europe.
Lincoln was a devoted reader of newspapers at a time when they had
little pretense of objectivity. The passages ``illuminate as only
contemporary writings can,'' Gerald Carson wrote in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEARTS IN ATLANTIS &LR;  By Stephen King. (Pocket Books, $7.99.)
This sprawling work _ two novellas, two short stories and an
epilogue _ is permeated by Vietnam and the survivor guilt among
those who did not go. ``We know now what Stephen King, the master
of horror, is afraid of,'' Caleb Crain wrote last year, even
though, he added, the war itself ``remains offstage.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIME, LOVE, MEMORY: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the
Origins of Behavior &LR;  By Jonathan Weiner. (Vintage, $14.) From his
study of the humble fruit fly, Seymour Benzer has achieved great
insights into the connections between DNA and behavior, both insect
and human. This is ``a lovely book about a lovely scientist'' and
``a wonderful description of biologists at work together,'' Lewis
Wolpert said in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad &LR; 
By David Haward Bain. (Penguin, $18.) The legendary golden spike
was an ordinary iron one, according to this definitive history.
From the drawing rooms of magnates like Leland Stanford to the
``hell on wheels'' where laborers binged, Bain brings an epic
project to life. ``The building of the Pacific railroad,'' Robert
M. Utley wrote last year, has never been recounted ``so thoroughly,
authoritatively and engagingly.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT &LR;  By Bill Pronzini. (Walker, $8.95.) In
this noir suspense thriller set in northern California, two men are
caught together in raging flood waters. One is a vintner tormented
by a childhood horror; the other is a trucker obsessed with finding
the hit-and-run driver who left his wife in a coma. ``It's a dark
and twisty road to the big smashup,'' Marilyn Stasio wrote in 1999,
``but these characters travel well.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SISTER WOLF &LR;  By Ann Arensberg. (Ballantine, $14.) A daughter of
a noble Hungarian family lives alone on 1,000 acres in the
Berkshires, which she has turned into a sanctuary for wild animals.
``This is a first novel of striking originality,'' Ella Leffland
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1980, calling it
``crisp, urbane, alive with wit.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PRODUCTIVE EDGE: A New Strategy for Economic Growth &LR;  By
Richard K. Lester. (Norton, $16.95.) The United States' standard of
living depends on authentic gains in productivity, and the nation
has much more to do to get its economy back on track, according to
this analysis by a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The book is ``a necessary corrective to all this
economic triumphalism,'' Jeff Madrick wrote in 1998, praising its
``cogent ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I COULD TELL YOU STORIES: Sojourns in the Land of Memory &LR;  By
Patricia Hampl. (Norton, $13.) This collection of essays explores
the art of memoir, as the author moves back and forth between a
series of recollections and accounts of reading others' memoirs.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1999, Linda Simon
called Hampl's prose ``rich and idiosyncratic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOY IN THE WATER &LR;  By Stephen Dobyns. (St. Martin's, $6.99.) In
Dobyns' 20th novel, the headmaster of a failing New Hampshire
boarding school investigates a murder on campus. ``His prose is
fluent and the plot races along like clockwork,'' Erik Burns wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE THE MOVIE: How Entertainment Conquered Reality &LR; , by Neal
Gabler. (Vintage, $14.) A cultural critic sees events like the O.J.
Simpson trial and the death of Diana, princess of Wales, as
national obsessions that overshadow ideas and ideology. Gabler
``has a fine old time showing how entertainment values have come to
permeate every nook and cranny of American life,'' Peter Biskind
wrote last year. ``It is impossible to put down this book
unconvinced of the cataclysmic effect of celebrity on every area of
American life.''
