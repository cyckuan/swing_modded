<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Massive Resources to Fight AIDS: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) said that countries in sub-Saharan Africa need a
massive infusion of resources to make significant headway against
the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS in the region.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said this in Lusaka
Wednesday when she presented a paper on strategies to reduce HIV
transmission at the on-going 11th International Conference on AIDS
and STDS (sexually transmitted disease) in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Poor countries need more encouragement in the fight against
AIDS and they need more income support, debt relief and resources,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also called on African countries to consider finding
new ways of attacking the crisis at country level.
</P>
<P>
She noted that since AIDS is straining a lot of resources,
African countries should consider setting up short-term targets
for prevention and treatment of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy noted that it was regrettable that Africa which deals
with four million new cases of AIDS every year only spends about
149 million U.S. dollars on HIV prevention while America spends
880 million dollars in the face of 40,000 new cases annually.

<HEADLINE> Mozambicans Urged to Vote on Voting Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has urged the people to vote in the country's second
democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the residents of the district of Manica in
central Manica Province Tuesday, the president called on all the
people to vote when the time comes but reminded them that in order
to vote, one must register first, and that voter registration ends
this Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chissano asked the people not to respond with violence to
provocations by any political party during the election campaign
scheduled to start mid- October, the Mozambique News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the electoral campaign runs peacefully. Let no
one intimidate anyone else," the president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chissano warned his audience that when the election campaign
starts, there will be intense political activity across the
country, and that he will be visiting many places as the
presidential candidate of the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front
Party (Frelimo) to explain his party's plan for governance for the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
"Those who like me, and those who do not, should go and say so
by voting. Those who like me, should not be afraid because nobody
will know which way have they voted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano refrained from making public his party's future plans
for governance, promising to do so during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he has been visiting various provinces and
districts during the past few weeks to hear what the people have
to say about the Frelimo government's record over the past five
years, and what they would like the future government to do as
priorities.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party Chief Raps Gov't Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- National Secretary of the
French Communist Party (PCF) Robert Hue criticized Wednesday the
economic policy of the Socialist government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, which he said is letting the market make the law.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with France Inter, Hue said it is "paradoxical
that the market continues to make the law while it is the
pluralist left who is running the country."
</P>
<P>
"A government of the left, a prime minister of the left, cannot
imagine not to find the answer, through the law, which will
prevent the market from crushing the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PCF, which is part of the ruling leftwing coalition, is
particularly unhappy about the government's failure to oppose a
layoff plan by the automobile tire group Michelin to downsize by
one tenth its 75,000 working force in Europe in three years.
</P>
<P>
Hue proposed during the annual festival of the PCF daily
"Humanite" last weekend that a "great national manifestation" be
made against unemployment and for employment of all.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said last week that the government could no longer exert
an omnipresent power in the economy.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President Calls for Helping Colombian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said Wednesday he would urge international organizations,
such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization of American
States (OAS), to back up the peace process in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan leader said that a foreign intervention in
Colombia would be ominous for the country, Venezuela and the Latin
American region.
</P>
<P>
Chavez confirmed that he would visit the U.N. General Assembly
next week and the OAS.
</P>
<P>
"Wherever I go, I will continue to announce publicly and call
on the world for joint contribution with Colombia in the search
for peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chavez denied that his government was helping the guerrilla
movement in Colombia, as was stated by the chief of the
paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, Pablo Catano.
He added that he would not be tricked into provocation.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president provoked the anger of the Colombian
government when he said he was willing to meet with the Colombian
guerrilla movement on Venezuelan territory, to put an end to the
rebel activities.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russia Ready to Promote Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said Wednesday that Moscow is ready to keep in touch with
all parties concerned to push forward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein, Yeltsin
said Russia would contact all parties concerned to help rebuild
confidence in the peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians,
Syria and Lebanon to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also expressed his appreciation for Abdullah's
"constructive role and efforts exerted to push forward the peace
process," Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The message is apparently reminding the parties concerned of
the fact that Russia does not want to be sidelined in the peace
process after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power in
July.
</P>
<P>
The former Soviet Union had been a key player in the Middle
East affairs with strategic relations with Israel's Arab
neighbors Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians during its
Cold War with the United States, which supported the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's influence in the Middle East has been steadily
declining due to its own chronic economic and political problems
at home following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia currently remains one of the biggest arms
suppliers to Syria and the two countries are still keeping their
traditionally strong relationships.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been playing a pivotal role in the peace process and
supports the resumption of peace talks on all tracks,
including the peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians,
Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Dismisses Iran's Allegations on POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday dismissed
Iran's allegations that Iraq still detains Iranian prisoners of
war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement that Iran
intentionally spread such lies to hide facts concerning the real
number of Iranian soldiers killed in the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war,
the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Najafi, an Iranian official in charge of POWs issue,
on Monday alleged that even the Iraqi negotiating delegation
confessed that Iraq are still holding Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said that the Iranian side knows very well
that Iraq has released all Iranian POWs under the supervision of
the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) while Iran still
detains a large number of Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a list of 3,199 Iranian
missing-in-actions (MIAs) and not POWs, claiming that Iraq has
shown a great deal of cooperation with the Iranian authorities to
find out information about those MIAs.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Iranian side of still refusing to offer more
information about those Iranian MIAs except a list of them.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has been an outstanding obstacle standing
in the way of normalizing ties between Iraq and Iran, two
former foes which fought an eight-year war in the 1980s in
which some one million people were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accuses Iran of still detaining 13,000 Iraqi POWs while
Iran says there are still 5,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq's prisons.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Urges for Consensus on SADC Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique Wednesday urged the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) to reach consensus
among its member countries before the implementation of the SADC
Trade Protocol, which aims to set up a free trade area in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said such a consensus should be
reached concerning the modalities of tariff reduction and the
rules of origin, taking into account the different levels of
development of the member countries, so as to avoid "the stronger
economics suffocating those that are still developing".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Mozambique/Germany Forum, organized by
the German NGO, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Simao stressed
that the Mozambican government needed to continue its negotiations
with other SADC countries on the matter so that by December
consensus will have been reached leading to Mozambican
ratification of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
SADC had hoped that the trade protocol would take effect as
from January 2000, but that depends on at least two thirds of the
member countries ratifying it. So far, only five of the 11 SADC
members that signed the document have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Simao said that in the case of Mozambique, one should take into
account that the economy is still recovering after a devastating
war, and "it needs a longer restructuring time before it attains
the levels of competitiveness of the other countries of the
region".
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Mozambican Association of Young Businessmen
Hipolito Hamela argued that the protocol should be implemented
sector by sector, thus protecting the most sensitive areas, such
as sugar, glass, and grain.
</P>
<P>
In the initial stage, Mozambique should enter the protocol with
the fishing, tobacco, timber, tea and cotton industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hamela insisted on a clear definition of national industrial
policy and, most of all, the relationship between formal and
informal trade.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the free circulation of people within the region,
Simao said that this should be an important complement of the
circulation of goods and services, since it is essential that
business people may easily come and go within the region.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that freedom of movement "should be done in
such a way that it does not create situations that may upset the
relations between the member states and, as a result, the regional
integration process itself".

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Civilian Wounded in Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese farmer was wounded
in Israeli shelling on a mountainous area in south Lebanon on
Wednesday, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Akla, 65, was moderately hurt when Israeli warplanes
fired missles on the mountain near Labbaya just north of the
eastern sector of the Israel-occupying border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There have been no apparent reasons for the Israeli air raids
which were the second in two days, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been
launching rocket and heavy machinegun attacks nearly on a daily
basis on Israeli troops inside the border enclave.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli troops out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> GCC Oil Ministers to Meet on Market Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will meet in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh on Saturday to discuss the situation in the world oil
market, GCC Secretary General Jamil Al-Hujailan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which comes ahead of a session of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) due in Vienna later this
month, will be an opportunity to assess the market condition and
put forward new proposals aimed at achieving a more balanced
market, Al-Hujailan was quoted by the Kuwait News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The oil-dependent GCC states have voiced satisfaction over the
improvement of oil prices in the past few months and promised a
continuous adherence to the OPEC production cut agreement signed
last March.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have bounced back dramatically since OPEC members
and non-OPEC producers began to impose a daily output reduction of
2.1 million barrels on April 1.
</P>
<P>
But, the GCC states, along with other OPEC members, are still
looking forward to additional improvement in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the ministers will also review a
number of issues concerning the cooperation among GCC states in
the fields of oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss a possible feasibility study on
promoting gas trade between the European Union and the GCC
states, which account for 13.7 percent of the world's natural gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance, comprises
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Once Close to Solution of Kashmir: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz disclosed on Wednesday that a four-point agreement
envisaging the resolution of the Kashmir dispute in nine to 12
months had once been very close to a conclusion during the Kargil
conflict.
</P>
<P>
But New Delhi backed out at the eleventh hour on the plea that
a caretaker government cannot make such a commitment, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to points of order in the Senate on reports
that the Kashmir dispute was to be solved by September or October
and the Kargil issue disrupted this process.
</P>
<P>
Aziz rejected the reports, but admitted that after the Lahore
summit in February this year, a process of "back channel"
diplomacy had started which remained active for about two months
and came to a standstill when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
collapsed in April.
</P>
<P>
During the Kargil crisis that broke out late May, India
approached Pakistan through back-door diplomacy in a bid to solve
the problem and a four-point understanding was developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziz, the understanding included time-bound
negotiations on Kashmir leading to its resolution in nine to 12
months, respect for the Line of Control (LoC) as per the Simla
Agreement, defusing of the Kargil situation and accepting the
significance of the Kashmir problem.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said it was almost finalized and as per
the understanding, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was to have a brief
stopover in New Delhi after his China visit in late June. He was
to issue a joint statement in this regard.
</P>
<P>
But India backed out from the understanding on the plea that a
caretaker government should not make such vital commitments, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kargil conflict, Aziz said there was "credible"
information to suggest that India was trying to cross the LoC.
Keeping this in view, Pakistani troops also moved on the LoC and
established some new posts.
</P>
<P>
During this course, Kashmiri Mujahideen (holy war fighters)
also occupied some posts in the Kargil-Drass sector in the
India-controlled Kashmir, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said some circles were trying to create misunderstanding by
giving an impression that the action of the armed forces disrupted
the process of dialogue with India.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Kargil crisis, he said, India was under
intense international pressure to have meaningful dialogue with
Pakistan for resolution of the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Question Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police started
Wednesday an investigation of former prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on suspicions of bribe-taking and misuse of public funds.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his wife Sara were summoned to the police
headquarters here Wednesday afternoon for questioning, a police
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The police did not give details about the questioning, but
said both Netanyahu and his wife should be given chances of
cleaning themselves of the charges, it said.
</P>
<P>
The case broke Tuesday when the local Hebrew paper Yediot
Aharonot ran a promotion of its own investigation into Netanyahu's
dealings.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Netanyahu received various domestic
maintenance and home renovation services from Avner Amedi, a
58-year-old Jerusalem businessman who owns a maintenance company.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Amedi's company supplied the Netanyahus
with a variety of services during his term as prime minister, but
Amedi neither requested nor received any payment for the
services, which carried out not only at the prime minister's
office, but at the couple's home and their official residence.
</P>
<P>
According to the story, after Netanyahu lost the May election,
Amedi presented the Prime Minister's Office a bill for 440,000
shekels (about 100,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said Netanyahu claimed he never asked Amedi to
carry out work for him.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Amedi on Tuesday on suspicions of having bribed
Netanyahu and the Tel Aviv Magistrate Court remanded him for two
days.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said Wednesday
Hurricane Floyd caused minimal damage at the Kennedy Space Center
in Cape Canaveral of Florida State.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane stayed 110 kilometers offshore, bringing
sustained wind of 100 kph, with gusts of 128 kph, NASA spokesman
George Diller said.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, workers had yet to check the two shuttle
launch pads. But a preliminary inspection of the buildings housing
the four shuttles and all the equipment for the international
space station uncovered no serious problems, Diller said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a piece of sheet metal blew off the 175-meter-high
Vehicle Assembly Building early Wednesday morning, and the phone
lines were down a few hours Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"It's minimal, very minimal," he said. "You can get this kind
of damage in a severe thunderstorm. We're just really pleased."
</P>
<P>
NASA planned to reopen the space center Thursday morning. Some
12,500 workers at the center were evacuated Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel said Wednesday that
the Palestinians have fulfilled one of their obligations in the
latest peace deal by presenting Israel the name list of the
Palestinian police force.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said in a statement that
Israel would begin to review the name list according to the
procedure stipulated in the revised Wye agreement signed in Egypt
last week.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest agreement, the Palestinians have to continue
to fulfill their obligations set down in the Wye agreement signed
last year, such as reducing the number of the Palestinian police
forces and collecting illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Former hard-line Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
froze the Wye agreement last year, two months after he signed on
it, accusing the Palestinians of failing to fulfill their
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Under signed accords between Israel and the Palestinians, the
number of Palestinian police should be kept at around
24,000. Israel said the current number was over 30,000.
</P>
<P>
In signs that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has got
back on the track, Israel has fulfilled its obligations in the
first stage of the latest agreement, handing over 7 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians and releasing 199 Palestinian
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also launched the permanent talks Monday with the
aim of resolving the thorny issues in the century-old conflict,
such as the Palestinian statehood and Jerusalem, within a year.

In the last 20 years, the total debts of African countries
increased by 53%, mainly because the interest rates of the loans
offered by public or private banks have duplicated from from 5.5%
to 10.4% during this period, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Tomas also mentioned the fluctuating exchange
rates as a progenitor for the augment of the debts under the title
"The External Debt of African Countries and the Impact on
Development and Democracy", saying that this kind of fluctuation
has made the reimbursements swell.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the African continent has seen the dropping prices
of coffee, cocoa, wood and other primary products, which has
seriously affected the export of the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 36th session of AIPU, a preparatory meeting for the 22th
Conference of the organization, also approved projects on the
resolutions for public administration and terrorism in the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Annan on Pros and Cons of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday listed pros and cons of globalization, saying,
"Globalization has become the essence of modern life. It must
become second nature in our thinking."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the U.N. chief is addressing the 52nd
Conference of the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) and
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO).
</P>
<P>
"Many experience globalization not as an agent of progress, but
as a disruptive force, almost hurricane-like in its ability to
destroy lives, jobs and traditions in the blink of an eye," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"For many there is an urge to resist the process and take
refuge in the comforts of the local," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization may be exacerbating inequality," he said. "It
may also be disturbing cultural traditions and increasing our
sense of spiritual disorientation."
</P>
<P>
"It gives me no pleasure to recite this litany, because
globalization is undeniably improving standards of living and
creating more opportunity," he said. "It is making us more
familiar with diversity."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that on the whole, over the long term, globalization
has been positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are all consumers in the same global economy," he said. "We
are all influenced by the same tides of political, social and
technological change."
</P>
<P>
"The ill winds and fouled waters of the earth's environment
likewise show no regard for the niceties of borders: pollution is
our common problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"People and cultures are increasingly hybrid," he said. "The
same icons, whether on a movie screen or a computer screen, are
recognized from Berlin to Bangalore."
</P>
<P>
"We are connected, wired, interdependent," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the world is becoming increasingly interdependent, countries
are feeling the pros and cons of globalization from various
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
Globalization will be one of major issues discussed at the
General Assembly general debate, scheduled to begin on September
20, and the conference of NGO meetings during the debate.

<HEADLINE> OIC Warns Disney Against Controversial Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) on Wednesday urged Walt Disney Co., the
U.S. entertainment giant, not to hold an Israel-financed
exhibition with the theme of "Jerusalem, Israel's Capital."
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli exhibition is a flagrant attempt to change
historical facts about Jerusalem," OIC Secretary General Ezzedin
Laraki said in a letter to Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said as "Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine," the
Israeli participation in the exhibition would negatively affect
the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the exhibition, if held, would offend more than
1.5 billion Muslims in 56 countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said Israel intended to finance an exhibit at
Disney world's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida of the United
States, which will depict Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Saudi billionaire Prince Waleed Ibn Talal, who is one
of the major investors in Disney Land Company in France, said on
Monday he had received assurance from Eisner that the exhibition
would not be held under the controversial title.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Doubles Tobacco Export to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Industry and
Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira Wednesday signed a five
million U.S.dollars tobacco export agreement with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the agreement would see Zimbabwe's tobacco
export earnings to Egypt more than doubling from about five
million U.S. dollars to 12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Eastern Tobacco Company of Egypt Mohamed Sadek
Ragab said the move by the Egyptian government to sign the trade
agreement followed the country's joining of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) this year.
</P>
<P>
!0Being a member of COMESA, it means that Egypt is now exempted
from high import taxation. This will increase our imports of
tobacco from Zimbabwe to Egypt,!1 Ragab said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is now able to import quality tobacco from
Zimbabwe at a subsidized duty of a reduction of about 90 percent,
hoping that the trade agreement with Zimbabwe will boost the
economies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been importing tobacco from Brazil at very high
import duties over the past years, he added.

<HEADLINE> First HIV Vaccine to be Tested on Human Beings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Production of the first ever
HIV vaccine with strains of the virus most common in Africa has
started.
</P>
<P>
President of the international AIDS vaccine initiative Seth
Berkley told journalists at the on-going 11th International
Conference on AIDS and STDS (sexually transmitted disease ) in
Africa (ICASA) in Lusaka Wednesday that the vaccine would be the
first ever to be produced between African researchers and those
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said the early clinical trials of the vaccine on human
beings begin in January 2000 in Britain before being introduced in
Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Berkley added that a vaccine is the only chance to end the
global AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"We need to get commitment from all levels of society that the
development of an HIV vaccine is a critical goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, Omo Anzala from the University of Nairobi said
the vaccine being developed, targeted the "Clade A" sub type, the
strain of HIV most common in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the vaccine contains fragments of getting the
body's immune system to recognize the virus and respond to it.
</P>
<P>
Anzala added that the vaccine would be tried on 40 healthy
Kenyans and a similar number of British volunteers to see the
expected immune response.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official: Better Trade Union Cadres Needed In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, said today that there
needs to be better training for more better trade union cadres.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also president of the All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, made the remark at a ceremony for the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the Chinese Workers' Movement Institute.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's reforms have entered a crucial period, a
time when new problems are popping up one by one. If trade unions
hope to play a role in China's reforms, they must have higher
quality cadres that are comfortable with the new situation and new
tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei said he hopes that the Institute will help train more of
these much-needed cadres for the country's trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The Institute is affiliated with the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions and has trained more than 70,000 trade union cadres
and other personnel.

<HEADLINE> Survey Backs Elected Lords in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 percent of
Britons favor an elected second chamber once the reform of the
House of Lords is completed, according to a survey released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1,000 people suggests only 11 percent
of the public back a system whereby the country's second most
important government institution would be solely appointed by the
prime minister of the day.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates strong support for a chamber with
strong powers to delay government legislation.
</P>
<P>
The research was commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Trust and
carried out by ICM.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggested 84 percent wanted an elected second
chamber, while only 11 percent opted for the appointed chamber,
which is one option being considered by ministers.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates strong support for a second chamber
with increased powers.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half, or 46 percent, said it should be able to delay
government bills to which it objected "indefinitely" unless it
could agree to a compromise with the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
A quarter thought it should be able to delay a new law for one
or two years and only a fifth would restrict the period of delay
to "a few months."
</P>
<P>
The new contributions on the future of the House of Lords come
as the bill ending the traditional right of hereditary peers to
sit and vote in the Lords -- the first stage of reform -- is due
to clear Parliament this autumn.
</P>
<P>
A ballot for the 92 hereditaries who will be allowed to stay
until stage two of reform is completed is scheduled to take place
in October.

<HEADLINE> MFC Bancorp to Provide Swiss Private Banking on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- MFC Bancorp Ltd. announced
Wednesday that it will provide Swiss Private Banking and Brokerage
services over the Internet through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
MFC Merchant Bank S.A.
</P>
<P>
The SwissNetBanking.com web site will offer investors the
opportunity to open a private Swiss bank account to trade
securities over the Internet beginning October 15, 1999, MFC said.
</P>
<P>
"MFC intends to be the first bank to offer small and
medium-sized investors the advantages of both Swiss private
banking and discounted brokerage services on a global basis
through the Internet," said Michael Smith, president of MFC
Bancorp Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Smith said, "Swiss banks are the largest offshore market in the
world, currently managing assets of approximately 1.5 trillion
U.S. dollars, which is 30 percent of the worldwide market for
international private banking."
</P>
<P>
"However, Switzerland, Europe and the rest of the world
significantly lag the U.S. in the development of Internet-based
discount stock brokerage services."
</P>
<P>
Peter Jessop, first vice president, MFC Merchant Bank S.A.,
said, "Our first trading services will be offered for stocks and
options traded on the U.S. exchanges. By the end of next year we
will offer trading facilities on the European, South &AMP; Latin
American, and Asian exchanges, and will provide concurrent
multilingual services."

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Lodges Protest With U.S. Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
expressed its displeasure and annoyance with the U.S. news
magazine Time for its failure to include the name of Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman in its special edition on prominent Asians of the
century, the official BSS news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter faxed Tuesday to the Time magazine in New York, the
United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its
"surprise" at the dropping of the name of "Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman" from the weekly's cover story entitled "The most
influential Asians of the 20th century."
</P>
<P>
The letter, addressed to the editor of the magazine, said
Sheikh Mujibur was acknowledged as one of the world's charismatic
leaders and a forceful advocate for peace.
</P>
<P>
"His name would feature in any list of prominent Asians of the
20th century," the letter was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry in its letter expressed the hope that the magazine
in future would take appropriate steps to reflect reality and
facts, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of the country's incumbent Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina, was born in March 1920 and was
assassinated in August 1975. He was the first prime minister of
independent Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Last Day of Strike in Bangladesh Passes Off Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The last day of a three-day
hartal (general strike) sponsored by the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance passed off almost peacefully
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Life was basically normal throughout the country, including the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 85 people in Dhaka on Wednesday during the
hartal for their alleged involvement in violence.
</P>
<P>
Different front organizations of the ruling Bangladesh Awami
League brought out anti-hartal processions and paraded different
city streets during the hartal hours.
</P>
<P>
Home, Post and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim
bitterly criticized the opposition for calling the three-day
hartal, saying that the opposition had tried to hold the people of
Dhaka city hostage by hurling bombs and creating panic.
</P>
<P>
The combined opposition declared a three-day hartal across the
country from Monday to demand the resignation of the government
and immediate parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Heightened Attention to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is urging greater
international and local response to the security concerns for the
on-going violent attacks against non-Albanian minorities in
Kosovo, U.N. officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for more outspoken attention to this matter,
not only by the international community, but by local leaders at
all levels," Kris Janowski, spokesman for UNHCR, said.
</P>
<P>
The message that violence was unacceptable must reach at the
community level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with cold months coming, UNHCR's winterization
program is well underway, in an attempt to ensure that each family
has one weatherproof room prepared.
</P>
<P>
Already, a great many Kosovars living in the mountainous
regions are feeling the autumn nip, he said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR and partner organizations have distributed nearly 8,000
shelter kits, roofing kits and other materials to aid Kosovars who
are "working feverishly to rebuild their homes," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is also providing 15,000 all-weather tents with stoves,
plus 20,000 tents to provide shelter to those whose homes will not
be rebuilt by winter. The agency has already distributed 800,000
blankets and more than 300 hectares of plastic.
</P>
<P>
With the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army returning to the Serbian
province in Yugoslavia after the end of the NATO air strikes,
non-Albanians, including Serbs, were suffering from persecutions,
and they were driven out of their homes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Pay for Arms Deal Over 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will pay
21.3 billion rands (3.55 billion U.S. dollars) over the next eight
years for new defense equipment, with the option to buy 8.5
billion rands (1.42 billion U. S. dollars) more, Defense Minister
Patrick Lekota said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The conversion of 30 percent of the original contract value of
31 billion rands (5.17 billion dollars) into options ensured that
the defense force could obtain the required equipment as needed,
without creating immediate fiscal pressures, South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted Lekota as saying at a media briefing in
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet at its fortnightly meeting had decided to buy the
following:
</P>
<P>
-- nine Grippen and 12 Hawk aircraft from British
Aerospace/Saab, to replace the current Cheetah and Impala
aircraft, with a further option to buy another 12 Hawks and 19
Grippens;
</P>
<P>
-- four patrol corvettes from the German Frigate Consortium,
to replace the present aging strike crafts;
</P>
<P>
-- 30 light utility helicopters from Italy's Augusta company,
to replace the Alouette helicopters; and
</P>
<P>
-- three submarines from the German Submarine Consortium, to
replace the aging Daphne submarines.
</P>
<P>
The 21.3 billion rands covers all statutory costs such as VAT,
custom duties, freight, export credit guarantees and program
management.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said that should the South African government decide not
to buy the outstanding equipment, it would not face any
cancellation penalties or costs.
</P>
<P>
The option has to be exercised by 2004.
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, the total equipment cost would increase by
8.5 billion rands to 29.9 billion rands (5 billion U.S. dollars),
over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
On whether the option would be exercised, Lekota said: "Most
probably."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet was fully satisfied with the arms-for-investment
offset arrangements, which would benefit the economy and advance
the socio- economic interests of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was unable to give details. Instead, he spoke
broadly about " some job creation" as part of the production which
would take place in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Lekota added that greater security for the country, linked to
the region, would also have spin-offs for investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
On which part of the defense force would benefit first, Lekota
said this was still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
"But personally, we are concerned with the state of the navy...
and then, of course, the air force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said the result of the procurement process was an
"affordable defense package combined with an industrial and
economic investment package spanning a variety of industrial
sectors and underpinning the government's industrial strategy".

LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Ukrainian delegation arrived
here Wednesday, trying to secure the release of nine Ukrainians
arrested by Zambian authorities earlier this month for alleged
espionage.
</P>
<P>
The delegation discussed the matter with Deputy Foreign
Minister Valentine Kayope and two other deputy ministers from the
Ministry of Home Affairs and the Defense Ministry of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Kayope told the delegation that his country is committed to
global stability, peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Most developing countries are faced with conflicts which often
take up much more attention and resources that would be best
utilized in development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said that in its efforts to
contribute to global stability and peace Zambia has pledged to
work together with other countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Head of the delegation Yuri Kostenko told the Zambian officials
that his country is looking forward to establishing bilateral
relationship with Zambia as the two countries have a lot in
common.
</P>
<P>
One Zambian, nine Ukrainians and a South African were arrested
for allegedly passing over a protected military place called
"PAPA4" at the Lusaka International Airport on August 15 this year
while flying over the airport.

<HEADLINE> Athens Quake Death Toll Rises to 135 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from last
Tuesday's earthquake in northwestern Athens has climbed to 135,
and it is likely to reach 140.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing Wednesday, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that rescue teams have so far
pulled 85 people alive from the rubble of collapsed buildings.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, a strong earthquake registering 5.9 on the
Richter scale rocked Athens with its epicenter being in the Mount
Parnitha region, some 20 kilometers northwest of the Greek
capital.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which is estimated to cost the country more
than 200 billion drachmas (about 645 million U.S. dollars), left
more than 2,000 people injured and some 60,000 others homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has taken a series of measures to help
earthquake victims. So far a number of tent cities have been set
up for homeless people and the government has promised to move
these people from tent cities to more durable housing within
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
As aftershocks occur on a daily basis, seismologists insist
that this is natural following last Tuesday's powerful earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Although seismologists say it is unlikely that aftershocks will
exceed 5 on the Richter scale, this critical period may last
several weeks.

<HEADLINE> France Expects Europe's Economy to Catch Up With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy and
Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Wednesday that Europe's
economic power will catch up with that of the United States in the
first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"If the decade of the 1990s was that of American prosperity,
the primary decade after the year 2000 can be the return of growth
and power of Europe," said Strauss-Kahn at a press conference when
presenting the government's budget for 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that next year, the global economic growth will be more
balanced as the United States will no longer be the only
locomotive of world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The growth will re-start everywhere in Europe," he said. "Most
of the economies in Asia, not Japan but Korea and Thailand, will
go better."
</P>
<P>
The minister also predicted that the biggest risk to be faced
by Europe is the impact from a forthcoming "touchdown" of the U.S.
economy, whose growth rate will fall by half in 2000 as compared
with 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Obtaining growth without the social inequality of the United
States" is the objective of Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that the major block faced by the French
economy is that it is much less supported by new technology than
that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of new technologies remains much slower in
France. To make up this backwardness can be one of the elements of
sustained growth in the coming years," he said.

MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Wednesday that all terrorists have been driven out
of the troubled Daghestan republic, the Itar-Tass news agency

Sergeyev told Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that dispersed

Chechnya, but law enforcement agencies and federal forces were

On August 7, some 1,200 Chechen rebels sneaked into Daghestan
and seized some villages. They were driven out by federal troops
after a two-week campaign.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Greece Hold Talks in Friendly Atmosphere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official have
signalled that the signing of an agreement on joint action against
terrorism will not be a precondition for bilateral cooperation in
this controversial area.
</P>
<P>
The issue of fighting terrorism and organized crime will be on
the agenda of the two-day Turco-Greek talks, which start on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talks the last session of the second round of dialog which
started in late July.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing like 'first agreement and then
cooperation'...An agreement is not a precondition. It is a means
of facilitating the cooperation," a Turkish official said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that "in our point of view, an agreement on
terrorism is necessary. It is still an objective for us, but it is
not being put forward as a precondition."
</P>
<P>
The official added that Turkey has worked productively in
cooperation with many countries on objectives not based on
defined agreements.
</P>
<P>
The thorny Turco-Greek ties went through a severe crisis in
February when Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
leader Abdullah Ocalan surfaced at the Greek Embassy compound in
Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had long been accusing Greece of supporting the PKK and
harboring PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece immediately improved bilateral ties
after the two neighboring countries were hit by strong quakes
separately.
</P>
<P>
After a 7.4-magnitude earthquake hit western Turkey on August
17, Greece sent a strong rescue team to help Turkey extricate
survivors trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings in western
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Later, Turkey was the first country to send its 20-member
rescue team to help Greece rescue the Greeks trapped in the
debris after a 5.9-magnitude quake hit Athens on September 8.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), have long been at odds over the
limits of air space, sovereignty over some Aegean islands and
the Cyprus issue.

CARACAS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said Wednesday he would urge international organizations,
such as the United Nations (U.N.) and the Organization of American
States (OAS), to back up the peace process in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan leader said that a foreign intervention in
Colombia would be ominous for the country, Venezuela and the Latin
American region.
</P>

Chavez confirmed that he would visit the U.N. General Assembly

<P>
"Wherever I go, I will continue to announce publicly and call
on the world for joint contribution with Colombia in the search
for peace," he added.

Chavez denied that his government was helping the guerrilla
movement in Colombia, as was stated by the chief of the
paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, Pablo Catano.
He added that he would not be tricked into provocation.

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Iraq to Accept Nothing Less Than Total </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said on Wednesday that Iraq will accept nothing less
than the total lifting of sanctions imposed on the country more
than nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters Wednesday evening on the sideline of the
on-going 9th International Popular Islamic Conference which has
been intended to show solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We are not concerned with the London meeting," said Aziz,
adding that Iraq has made a legitimate and clear-cut demand for
totally lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A meeting attended by representatives of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, namely Britain, China,
France, Russia and the U.S., is underway in London to discuss the
Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the U.S. launched a propaganda campaign against
Iraq recently, which will not convince any fair-minded person,
because U.S. lies about Iraq has been widely exposed before the
international community.
</P>
<P>
He also said the just-concluded 112nd Arab League foreign
ministers meeting chaired by Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said
al-Sahaf was successful and was held in a positive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq,
deliberations inside the Security Council on the Iraqi issue
have reached an impasse.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. resolutions, the U.N. economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait should be
lifted after U.N. weapons inspectors verify that it is free of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, weapons inspections have not been resumed after the
withdrawal of the U.N. weapons inspectors from Iraq last December
before the U.S-British bombardment of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly announced that the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq is "dead" and accused the commission
of spying for the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The London meeting will reportedly discuss the British-Dutch
proposal on the Iraqi issue, of which Iraq has time and again
voiced rejection.
</P>
<P>
The proposal recommends a temporary suspension of the
restrictions on Iraq's oil sales if Baghdad fully cooperates with
an enlarged body of weapons inspections which will replace UNSCOM
and agrees to the creation of strict financial controls of its oil
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has rejected the plan outright, insisting that it will
accept nothing less than a total lifting of the embargo.

<HEADLINE> China: UN Resolution 2758 Solves Issue of China's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The 26th session of
the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 which
confirmed the "one China" principle and solved the issue of
China's representation at the U.N. in a just, thorough and
comprehensive manner, China stressed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the issue of so-called Taiwan's participation at
the United Nations raised once again by a small number of
countries, Chinese Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin
Huasun said at the 54th session of the General Assembly that
Resolution 2758 corrected the historical mistake created by the
Cold War by recognizing clearly and unequivocally that "the
representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China
to the United Nations is the only lawful representative of China
to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of China is
one of the five permanent members of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Qin said restoring the legitimate rights of the People's
Republic of China at the United Nations and expelling the Taiwan
authorities from the Organization are two indivisible aspects of
the one issue of China's representation at the United Nations, and
one cannot be without the other.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the adoption of the resolution defeated the attempts
of a handful of countries to create "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" at the United Nations, and the resolution is in
conformity with the historical trend of the times and accords with
the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
As of the day when the legitimate rights of the People's
Republic of China were restored at the United Nations, the
Government of the People's Republic of China rightfully represents
all Chinese, including the Taiwan compatriots, in the United
Nations and all organizations related to it; thus, there is simply
no such issue as Taiwan's so-called "representation at the United
Nations," Qin added.

sovereign states and the Charter of the United Nations clearly
stipulates that U.N. membership is open only to sovereign states,
China said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the issue of so-called Taiwan's participation at
the United Nations raised once again by a small number of
countries, Chinese Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun
said at the 54th session of the General Assembly that as a
province of China, Taiwan is in no position to participate in the
work or activities of the United Nations or its specialized
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the issue of Taiwan is fundamentally different from
those of Germany and Korea and cannot be placed on a par with
them, and the Germany and Korea issues were results of a series of
international agreements reached during and after World War II
while the issue of Taiwan is a leftover of China's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the principle of parallel representation does not
apply to Taiwan at all, Qin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a small number of countries which once again
raised the issue of so-called "Taiwan's participation at the
United Nations, Chinese Permanent Representative to U.N., Qin
Huasun, said at the 54th session of the General Assembly that
numerous international instruments, including the 1943 Cairo
Declaration and the 1945 Postdam Proclamation, reaffirmed time and
again China's sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qin said according to international law, the change of
government in a country does not change the composition of its
territory or citizens, and the founding of the People's Republic
of China in 1949 ended the history of the government of the
Republic of China, and the government of the People's Republic
of China has been the sole legal government representing the
whole of China ever since.
</P>
<P>
Qin said as a matter of fact, the Government of People's
Republic of China, inheriting all Chinese territories under the
jurisdiction of the previous government of the Republic
of China, has exercised sovereignty over the whole of China,
including Taiwan province and become the sole legal
representative of China in the international community.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 160 countries in the world have
diplomatic relations with China, and they all acknowledge that
there is only one China in the world, that Taiwan is a part of
China and that the Government of the people's Republic of China
is the sole legal government representing the whole of China,
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin said although the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are in
a state of separation now, that does not change the status of
Taiwan as a part of China, nor China's sovereignty over Taiwan,
and the two sides of the Straits are by no means two countries,
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Thus it is nothing strange that the minute it was dished ot,
lee Tenghui's "special state-to-state relationship" theory met
with unanimous opposition and condemnation of all Chinese within
and outside of China, as well as wide criticism by the
international community, Qin added.

<HEADLINE> Localization to Be Major New Trend in 21st Century: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Localization, the growing
economic and political power of cities, provinces, and other
sub-national entities, will be one of the most important new
trends in the 21st century, according to a new World Bank report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Together with accelerating globalization of the world economy,
localization could revolutionize prospects for human development
or it could lead to chaos and increased human suffering, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Development Report 1999/2000: Entering
the 21st Century, improved communications, transportation and
falling trade barriers are not only making the world smaller, they
are also fueling the desire and providing the means for local
communities to shape their own future.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is like a giant wave, that can either capsize
nations or carry them forward," said World Bank Chief Economist
and Senior Vice President Joseph Stiglitz, who oversaw the team
that prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
"Successful localization creates a situation where local
entities and other groups in society -- the crew of the boat if
you will -- are free to exercise individual autonomy but also have
incentives to work together," Stiglitz said.
</P>
<P>
When localization works, decentralizing power to the provincial
and local level can result in more responsive and efficient local
government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But localization can also result in over-burdened local
governments being unable to provide local infrastructure and
services. Localization can threaten macroeconomic stability, and
hence economic growth, if local governments borrow and spend
heavily and need to be bailed out by national governments. And at
the extreme, demands for local autonomy can lead to ethnic strife
and civil war.
</P>
<P>
Globalization and localization are both inevitable, the report
said. Whether a country succeeds in the 21st century will depend
on how well it manages these twin forces.
</P>
<P>
The report said that given current projections, the number of
people living in absolute poverty will continue to increase. At
the start of the new millennium, an estimated 1.5 billion people
will subsist on the equivalent of a U.S. dollar a day, up from 1.2
billion people in 1987. By 2015 the number of people subsisting
below this international poverty line could reach 1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, based on recent trends, income disparities between
industrial and developing countries will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a growing number of the world's
poorest people will live in cities. In 1950, the number of people
living in cities was about the same in industrialized and in
developing countries -- about 300 million. By 2000, some 2 billion
people will live in cities in developing countries, more than
twice the number of urban dwellers in industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Many cities in developing countries are already having
difficulty coping with this surge in population. About 220 million
urban dwellers, 13 percent of the developing world's urban
population, lack access to safe drinking water, and about twice
this number lack access to even the simplest of latrines.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, stressed that even in those countries with
large numbers of people living in poverty, sound policies and
effective institutions can do much to improve the quality of
people's lives.

<HEADLINE> China: Issue of Taiwan is Purely an internal Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To solve the question of Taiwan and realize reunification of
the motherland, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping came up with
the creative concept of "peaceful reunification and one country,
two systems" which later became and still remains a fundamental
state policy, and President Jiang Zemin put forward an eight-point
proposal for developing cross-straits relations and promoting
peaceful reunification of the motherland, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
All these policies and proposals have taken into account the
paramount interests of national development and the long-term
interest of the entire Chinese population, and they have also
accommodated and helped protect the fundamental interest of
Taiwan compatriots and Taiwan's need for development, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Qin pointed out these policies and principles are warmly
supported by all Chinese, including Taiwan compatriots, and well
received by international community, and the smooth return of Hong
Kong in 1997 and the return of Macao by the end of this year have
proven the policy of "one country, two systems" is the aspiration
of all Chinese, including Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Chinese Government has taken a
series of measures in recent years to promote dialogue,
personnel exchange, economic relations and trade between the two
sides of the Straits, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The separatist remarks by Lee Tenghui and the Taiwan
authorities's attempt to create "two Chinas" in the international
arena have severely damaged cross-straits relations, built up
tension in the area and endangered peace and security in the
Asia Pacific, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the small number of countries would only fan
the flames of Taiwan's separatist activities, hinder China's
peaceful reunification and undermine peace and stability in the
Taiwan straits area and the Asia pacific as a whole, Qin added.

LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Wednesday that
representatives of the five permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council made progress in talks held here to find
ways to ease sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The permanent five political directors had a useful and

</P>
<P>
"Progress was made but eventual success is not certain," a

position to put pressure on Iraq to meet its international
obligations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The report said the meeting had achieved "some steps forward."
</P>
<P>
All five representatives stated they wanted to reach a
consensus on Iraq and suspend some of the trade sanctions in place
since the 1990-91 Gulf War, the report said.

of Kosovo Albanian separatists "as an additional milestone in
consolidating peace and security in Kosovo".
</P>
<P>
They urged the KLA leadership and "all Kosovar armed elements to

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
on Wednesday that it sends hundreds of American troops to East
Timor as part of a multinational force in order to protect its
military and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Indonesia stands
astride critical sea lanes and lines of communication, which are
critical to the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
"If Indonesia is unable to deal with a situation like East
Timor, if it were to continue to spin out of control, it could
affect the future of Indonesia and thus our national security,"
he said in defending the limited U.S. military intervention
approved by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the U.N. Security Council authorized a
multinational force "to take all necessary measures" to restore
peace and ensure that the territory moves toward independence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has announced to send hundreds of troops to
participate in the multinational force in East Timor, but has
decided to exclude the troops from potential combat situations.
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of American troops would perform logistical,
intelligence and communications duties, keeping clear of any
outbreaks during U.N. peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Boy of 13 years Old Convicted of Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Youth Court in Alberta,
Canada, convicted a 13-year-old boy of manslaughter Wednesday months
after he shot an even younger boy to death at a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
According to a news dispatch from the province, the boy was told of
the conviction he "will live with for a long time". A pre-sentencing
report is due on November 5 for the 13-year-old, who was originally
charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
In what the court judge called "a horrible tragedy" on March 13, a
boy of 11 years old was shot while playing games with the convict,
whose father had 16 guns at home and was out around 10 p.m., leaving
five children unattended in the house at his son's birthday party.
</P>
<P>
After a horseplay, the two boys began challenging each other by
taking up guns. The victim was aimed at and got shot with a 30-30
calibre hunting rifle.
</P>
<P>
The 13-year-old later called police for help in a panicky voice: "I
just shot this guy. I didn't mean to... He's bleeding everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Individually owned weapons have caused increasing concerns in
Canada. A recent official survey shows "10 percent of Grade 9 boys
said their friends carry weapons." Of the 161 cases of expulsion from
Edmonton schools last year, 62 students were expelled for weapons
offenses, local media said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty, Excessive Consumption Major Causes of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The continued poverty of the
majority of inhabitants of the planet and excessive consumption by
the minority are the two major causes of environmental
degradation, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) said.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP revealed the key finding in its Global Environment
Outlook 2000 report issued in Nairobi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report is the most authoritative assessment ever of the
environmental crisis facing humanity in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
It also finds that the present course is unsustainable
development and warns that postponing action is no longer an
option.
</P>
<P>
"Despite successes on various fronts, time for a rational and
well- planned transition to a sustainable system is running out
fast," UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer was quoted as saying
in the report.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas, it has already run out. In others, new problems
are emerging which compound already difficult situations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Until recently, few individuals cared about or even knew of
the environmental issues facing the planet. Today, popular
movements in many countries are forcing authorities to make
changes," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted by the scientific team for the report,
200 scientists in 50 countries identified water shortage and
global warming as the two most worrying problems for the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
Desertification and deforestation at national and regional
levels was also a frequently cited concern in many regions.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ambassadors Urged to Improve Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Wednesday charged heads of the country's foreign missions
to help "retrieve" the country's image, which suffered from years
of isolation during the past 15 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of a four-day seminar for some 106
ambassadors-designate approved by the country's Senate before its
recess last week, Obasanjo acknowledged the past "few years have
been difficult for the country."
</P>
<P>
"Many countries severed relations with us and some even imposed
 sanctions on us," the president told the envoys, the first set
appointed after the May 29 inauguration of his administration.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, whose speech was aptly titled "New Horizons for
Nigerian Foreign Policy," urged the envoys to help "clean up the
country's image" and revive the confidence of Nigerians in the
ability of their 97 missions to protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who has submitted a bill to the country's 469-member
legislature to check public sector graft, reminded the envoys that
profligacy and "misapplication of public funds would no longer be
tolerated. "
</P>
<P>
"The era of lack of accountability is over," he warned the
envoys, some of whom were among those recalled some four months
ago as part of a restructure of the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The president said they would be evaluated "periodically" on
the basis of the "specific objectives of their charters," and on
such parameters as the prudent management of resources, the stock
of goodwill generated for the country.

<HEADLINE> Crime Can Be Addictive, Says UK Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- People who have committed
criminal offenses tend to continue their activity at the risk of
getting caught because they are addicted to their behaviors, a
leading British criminal psychologist said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Normal criminal "motives" such as financial gain, revenge or group
activity do not seem to be sufficient to explain why some people
continue their life of crime despite the high probability of getting
caught.
</P>
<P>
John Hodge, from Nottinghamshire's Rampton Hospital, Britian's
most secure hospital where criminals with mental disorders are
housed, believed addiction may be the reason.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the British Association's Festival of Science in
Sheffield, England, Hodge said repeat offenders such as serial
killers, rapists and arsonists may be committing the same crimes
again and again because of the feeling that is produced by the act.
</P>
<P>
He said that when criminals carry out an activity to which they
are addicted, it makes them feel good. They then need to spend an
increasing amount of time on the activity in order to achieve the
same positive feelings.
</P>
<P>
Recent research has identified that addiction is not just about
chemical dependancy, and the concept of "behavioral addiction" has
been created to describle gambling, internet use and criminal act.
</P>
<P>
Using these new ideas, Hodge has found that "the criminal
activity can itself become an end in itself with no other purpose
than to help the perpetrator feel better".
</P>
<P>
He believed that examining the possibility of criminal behavior
itself being addictive may develop the understanding of both
addictions and of criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
"It also opens up to criminals the wide range of interventions now
available to help people with addiction," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Recovery Needs Time: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
said Wednesday that the country's economy is expected to remain
weak for the rest of this year and into early 2000.
</P>
<P>
In its September monthly economic review, the bank said that
Kenya's economy could recover in the second half of 2000 if the
government takes reform measures and appropriate economic
policies.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has
made a series of changes including several cabinet reshuffles in a
bid to recover the country's collapsed economy.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Moi announced a major government reshuffle, cutting
the number of ministries from 27 to 15 in order to improve the
efficiency of public services and reduce the expenditure of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The changes, especially in the public services, are greeted
with the welcome from some international agencies and also with a
glimpse of hope for resuming the negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a suspended loan package.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economic growth has declined dramatically since the IMF
 suspended the loan in July 1997. Its gross domestic product
(GDP) growth dropped to 1.8 percent in 1998 from 2.3 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Its GDP further declined to 1.4 percent in the year to June,
due to poor infrastructure, increased insecurity and poor
governance, which lowered production efficiency and reduced
investors' confidence, according to the central bank's economic
review.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of Finance Ministry Martin Oduor said that
last week' s reshuffle was one of the first steps in Kenya's
journey toward economic recovery and the economy could not turn
around overnight.
</P>
<P>
A senior economist in the central bank held that recent efforts
taken by the government to turn the economy back on track would
need time to produce results.

MADRID, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Spain will do everything
possible to preserve its relations with the Chilean government,
said Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Matutes told the Congress that Spain will continue to respect
the legal principles in the Pinochet case, although Chile will
have the last word in the issue.
</P>
<P>
Matutes said that his government would continue working so that
the bilateral relations would not deteriorate.

<P>
At the same time, he insisted that the decisions of the
tribunal would be respected, "even against our desire and at the
cost of the good relations".
</P>
<P>
Chile's ex leader Augusto Pinochet has been under arrest in
London since October 16 on a warrant from Spanish Judge Baltasar
Garzon. Spain wants him extradited to its territory for trial. A
hearing on the request is to begin September 27.
</P>
<P>
Chile has repeatedly demanded that Pinochet be allowed to
return home to face trial. It has asked Spain to agree to
international arbitration on who has jurisdiction over the case.

<HEADLINE> London Market Ends At Five-week Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- London stock market ended
Wednesday at a five-week low as U.S. inflation data failed to
completely reassure traders about the Federal Reserve's next rate
move.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 Index opened in negative territory and stayed
there for most of the day, eventually closing 48.3 points down at
6067.7.
</P>
<P>
The index was weighed down by heavyweight oil stocks suffering
losses, as together, the oil giants constitute around 13 percent
of the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco and Shell followed Brent crude oil futures lower after
American Petroleum Institute data slightly disappointed market
makers. BP Amoco was down 34p at 1144p and Shell lost 7.75p to
497.25p.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eurotop 300, a broader measure of the largest
pan-European shares, was 0.22 percent lower at the close, at
1312.99.
</P>
<P>
News that U.S. inflation is firmly under wraps provided only a
temporary boost to blue chip shares in London.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a pretty volatile session with the U.S. data
causing gyrations in the market," said the head of trading at a
U.S. bank here.

<HEADLINE> CIS for Joint Action Against Threats to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The defense officials of nine
member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States vowed here
Wednesday to work together to fight threats to their interests.
</P>
<P>
Any actions undermining the stability and security of CIS
countries "will be regarded as a threat to their national and
collective interests," said a joint statement approved by an
extraordinary meeting of CIS defense ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers confirmed their readiness "to take adequate joint
steps to prevent and eliminate" threats to their interests in the
framework of multilateral and bilateral understandings, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They aired their support for the efforts of Central Asian
countries and Russia to stabilize the situation in Kyrgyzstan,
where large militant formations have occupied areas in the south.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door conference addressed the situation in southern
Kyrgyzstan and mapped out urgent measures to render military-
technical and other assistance in stabilizing the situation to
Bishkek, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
They expressed grave concern over the operations of terrorist
groups and said that such actions "create a threat to the security
of Central Asia as a whole, not just Kyrgyzstan."
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary meeting was called at the initiative of
Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev for the discussion of military aid
and supplies to Kyrgyzstan, which has been invaded by militants
from Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
It is being attended by the Armenian, Belarussian, Kazakh,
Kyrgyz, Tajik and Russian defense ministers. Azerbaijan and
Georgia have also sent representatives.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin addressed the meeting,
saying international terrorism plans to destroy the CIS and set up
military dictatorships throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
"Those who pull the strings want the armed gangs to destroy the
common policy and the very unity of the Commonwealth countries,
subvert their security and establish pseudo-theocratic but
essentially military dictatorial regimes in countries which have
traditionally been close to us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the plans should be nipped in the bud.
</P>
<P>
"We must use all the resources of our organization and will" to
tackle the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Moscow's special interest in continuing the
dialogue and working out a common position with Trans-Caucasian
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The governments of Azerbaijan and Georgia will hopefully join
our consultations soon," he said.

maintain the vigor and vitality of the organization;
</P>
<P>
-- actively press ahead with the mutually beneficial
cooperation among APEC members.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that Jiang pointed out the future development
direction of regional economic cooperation and that his appeals
have received "wide attention and praise" from other APEC members.

and U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks and exchanged views on
bilateral relations and other issues of common concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Legislation to effectively
save energy in the Chinese capital was approved today by the
Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the
city's legislative body, and will take effect December 1.
</P>
<P>
Energy shortage and mismanagement have been major problems for
economic development in Beijing, officials here said. The city
consumes huge amounts of energy every year, and is second only to
Shanghai in energy use.
</P>
<P>
Much of Beijing's energy comes from coal, which is the major
culprit in the city's heavy air pollution, they said, so the "
methods of implementing China's energy-saving law" call for
transforming Beijing into an energy-saving city, limiting energy-
consumption by industries, and adjusting its energy structure.
</P>
<P>
The methods say that all capital investment projects will have
to have preliminary energy-use studies and major energy users will
be put under stricter controls and supervision, and energy-saving
will have to be worked into the market mechanism.

<P>
Both countries have been able to establish confidence in good
faith, Lee was quoted as saying.

Lee also made it clear that government to government
cooperation on the economic front can be carried out only if
enterprises are commercially viable, TCS said.

Fourth Meeting of the China-Singapore Joint Steering Council on
SIP with Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing.
</P>

At the meeting both countries endorsed a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) signed by Chinese and Singapore teams on June
28, 1999, which charted out the SIP's next phase of development.
</P>
<P>
In the MOU, Chinese and Singapore teams agreed on the package
of solution to put the SIP project on a more successful footing.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, from January 1, 2001, the Chinese Consortium
will increase its shareholding in the Chinese-Singapore SIP
Development Co. Ltd. (CSSD) from present 35 percent to 65 percent
while the Singapore Consortium will reduce its shareholding in the

<HEADLINE> Cai Upbeat about Another Clean Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Cai Zhenhua, who guided
the all-conquering Chinese team home from last month's 45th World
Table Tennis Chinese Championships full-handed with all five gold
and silver medals on offer, predicted another Chinese clean sweep
this time here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese head coach said unless something extrordinary
happens, China, who fielded a first-string paddlers to '99 China
Grand Prix which started here today, will sweep the board, once
and again.
</P>
<P>
"I am being cautious to say that we can at least land two of
the possible four golds. The fact is, it's every inch possible for
us to make another clean sweep," Cai, himself a world
championships men's singles silver medallist in 1981, said.
</P>
<P>
Though it's a little bit hard to get players motivated after
the Eindhoven world championships - they took some days off to
have a rest from hectic schedules - the Chinese superiority is
clean and clear, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
All the female players - they are all Chinese - who made the
podium at the world championships are competing here while the men
's field appeared depleted as some of the top European players -
such as Jan-ove Waldner of Sweden, Vladimir Samsonov of Russia,
Zoran Primorac of Croatia, failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang and Wang Nan, newly-crowned men's and women's
singles world champions respectively, could be struggling to
defend their titles since both of them had injury problem, Cai
revealed, but this would be a good opportunity for other Chinese
players.
</P>
<P>
But Cai, who masterminded the Chinese monopoly at Eindhoven
which saw the table tennis individual worlds transform into a
domestic championship with all the finalists in the five
catogaries are Chinese, refused to predict who are going to emerge
the winners from the ITTF Pro-Tour event.
</P>
<P>
China Grand Prix, inaugurated back in 1988, run from 16-18 with
114 players from 18 countries and regions vying for a 61,000 US
dollars prize money.

<HEADLINE> Companies Losing to Save Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Stiff competition is underway
among multinational cosmetic companies in efforts to save brands
at a substantial loss, the Globe and Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The insolvent T. Eaton Co. Ltd. is busy negotiating deals, not
of liquidation sales, but of profit-making reselling of cosmetics
to famous suppliers such as Estee Lauder Inc.
</P>
<P>
The industry leader is reported to have cleared its goods
ranging from fragrances to skin care products out of Eaton's,
leaving behind empty shelves that were used for the proud display
of Estee Lauder, Clinique and Prescriptives brands.
</P>
<P>
Chanel Inc., Shiseido Co. Ltd., Elizabeth Arden Canada and some
other high-profile cosmetics makers are still in talks with Eaton'
s liquidators to buy back their products at the stores.
</P>
<P>
Executives of the cosmetic companies would not disclose how
much they offered to buy back their products. But insiders have
expected the repurchasing deals at about 80 percent of their
retail value.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Estee Lauder, up to 20 million Canadian dollars
(about 14 million U.S. dollars) may have been paid for the goods
that were originally sold to Eaton's at 15 million dollars (about
10 million U.S. dollars), the newspaper quoted insiders as saying.
</P>
<P>
The companies don't want to see products they have spent
millions of dollars marketing sold at steep discounts in a fire-
sale atmosphere, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The cosmetic companies began taking steps to retrieve their
products after Eaton's was awarded court protection from creditors
on August 23.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's New International Airport Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong
International Airport opened to traffic today.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern Airlines and Shanghai Airlines, which are based
in Shanghai, had inaugural flights this morning from the new
airport to Xiamen in southeast China's Fujian Province and Kunming
in southwest China's Yunnan Province, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The new airport covers a 12-sq.km. area and has a runway which
is 4,000-meter long and 60 meters wide and a terminal building
with a total floor space of 280,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
It can handle 20 million passengers and 750,000 tons of cargo
annually.
</P>
<P>
The construction work cost 13 billion yuan (about 1.6 billion U.
S. dollars) and has taken more than two years. The new airport
will make Shanghai the first Chinese city with two large
international airports.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's air traffic has grown 23 percent annually on average
in recent years and it had 13.7 million passengers in 1998,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Its other airport, Hongqiao, has an annual handling capacity of
9.6 million passengers, which is far from adequate for the rapidly
increasing demand, so the new airport will help the city increase
its capacity to meet the needs of future development, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Remain Low Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that the number of new claims for unemployment benefits
declined slightly last week.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that 288,000 people filed first-time
claims for jobless benefits the week ended Sept. 11, down by 4,000
from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out week-
to-week volatility, changed a little, falling by just 250 to 288,
750 last week.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an
indication of an extremely tight labor market. Claims have hovered
below that mark for eight consecutive weeks now, and have not
strayed far above it all year. So they worry that employers may
feel pressure to raise wages and benefits, which could drive up
prices.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the Federal Reserve has twice raised interest
rates as a pre-emptory strike against possible inflation.
</P>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate in August remained at a 29-year
low of 4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaeological Landmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered 80 pieces of stone armors and 30 stone helmets in a
burial pit at the tomb of China's first emperor, which has been
called by some "the eighth wonder of the world".
</P>
<P>
The 13,000-square-meter pit is in the southeast part of a
burial ground and is similar in shape to the two large pits that
were found earlier.
</P>
<P>
The armors and helmets are made of dark blue stone plates of
uniform thickness that are attached with copper strips,
archaeologists said at a press conference in Xi'an today.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the stone came from a mountainous area 50 km
north of the tomb and some say that it is hard to imagine how
large stone could be worked into small flat plates with holes
drilled without the use of advanced machine tools.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese scholar called the find "unprecedented" and said
that "such perfect craftsmanship has never been recorded and that
the items fill a gap in the understanding of Chinese military
equipment in ancient times."
</P>
<P>
They could be important to the study of political, economic,
military, scientific and cultural developments of the Qin Dynasty,
according to Wu Yongqi, the curator of the Qin Shihuang Terra-
cotta Warrior Museum.
</P>
<P>
The stone helmets help correct a traditional misconception that
during the Qin Dynasty people were unable to make helmets, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Another treasure dug up from the new pit is a 212-kg bronze
tripod, the heaviest found since New China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Last May, archaeologists unearthed a dozen colored pottery
figurines, some of which have big bellies. One archaeologist
surmised that they are doing Qigong, a system of deep breathing
exercises, or doing acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the emperor Qin Shihuang
forced 800,000 workers to build the tomb for him when he was only
13 years old.
</P>
<P>
This splendid archeological find was accidentally discovered in
1974 by a farmer who was digging a well. Since then, three huge
pits have been discovered near the tomb.
</P>
<P>
More than seven thousand 2,200-year-old life-sized terra cotta
warriors and horses and tens of thousands of weapons have been
discovered in the three pits.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the warriors and horses, which are less than a
mile from the emperor's tomb, was to protect the spirit of their
ruler through eternity, an archaeologist explained.

<HEADLINE> Two Stages Cancelled after Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The second and the
sixth stages of the first-day route in the China Rally, the 11th
round of the World Rally Championship, are to be cancelled for
rain damage, a top organising official said on Thursday here.
</P>
<P>
Overnight heavy rain on Wednesday caused unpassable damages on
the road in the Qidaohe stage, the longest one of 33.07 kilometers
in the first leg, with 20 stages left in the rally, which is for
the first time included by the FIA in the World Champoinship.
</P>
<P>
The traditional super-special had been cut off due to the rain,
which continually hit the area on Thursday, and the opening
ceremony was postponed to Friday's morning before the start of the
race on eight o'clock of the local time.
</P>
<P>
A total of 67 cars entered the rally, the only round held in
Asia in the World Rally, with defending champion Tommi Makinen of
Mistubishi leading the drivers to start the first leg.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Possum Bourne, leader of the Asia-Pacific Rally
Championship, pulled out of the race because he crashed in a
domestic competition before he came to China.
</P>
<P>
Yoshihiro Kataoka of Japan, who is sharing the top place with
Bourne on 35 points, is set to win the regional race because the
China Rally is the last stop after Rally de Nouvelle Caledonie was
cancelled.

<HEADLINE> Van Gogh Drawing Unveiled 60 Years After Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- British auctioneers unveiled
on Thursday a pen-and-ink drawing by Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh,
which was returned to the family of a Jewish collector 60 years
after being looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
L'Olivette (Les Baux), showing twisted olive trees set in front
of rolling French hills, will be sold in December by an elderly
relative of manufacturer Max Silberberg, who died in a Nazi
concentration camp, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
The drawing could fetch about 3 million pounds (4.8 million U.S.
dollars) at auction.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it may be the first of a wave of art coming to the
market which was seized in Nazi Germany and is now being returned
to its owners' descendants.
</P>
<P>
L'Olivette was returned to 85-year-old Gerta Silberberg last
month after she was able to prove the drawing was seized from her
father-in-law in a "forced sale" before ending up in Berlin's
National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Silberberg's drawing was handed over by the Berlin gallery once
it became clear there was a legitimate claim on it.
</P>
<P>
Experts said more valuable looted art was likely to be returned
to its owners as archives in eastern Europe, hidden during the
Cold War, were opened up.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paleontologists Getting Close To Origin Of Birds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese paleontologist and
his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology have published a new
study on the origin of birds in the British journal "Nature".
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old paleontologist Xu Xing and his colleagues have
published 6 articles in "Nature" and in the U.S. journal "Science
" on a feathered dinosaur, Sinornithosaurus, which may be the
ancestor of birds. Xu offers a lot of information for use in the
study of the origin of birds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he and the other scientists wrote that the
feathers of modern birds most likely originate from a down-like
integumentary structure on a new kind of dinosaur they found in
northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Hou Lianhai of the same institute disagreed
in an article in "Nature" and challenged the widely-believed
theory of the bird links.
</P>
<P>
After that, Swisher Carl of the Berkeley Geochronology Center
in the United States and Wang Yuanqing and other scientists at CAS
pinpointed the age of many fossils found in Liaoning Province in
northeast China, including several kinds of feathered dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
The results, which were published in "Nature," say that the
fossils were younger than was previously thought and have forced
scientists to re-consider the complexity of evolution.

<P>
XI'AN, China, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Famous coach Ma Junren's
disciples finished one-two in the women's 1,500-meter finals in
the fourth Chinese City Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Top favorite Lan Lixin, the world junior champion who clocked 4:
10.05 in France in July, 1998, broke away in the last 500 meters
to stand atop the podium in 4:11.62, as her Dalian teammate Wu
Qingdong finished second in 4:14.11.
</P>
<P>
Seven runners coached by Ma Junren, entered the field of the 12
competitors and wounded up six of the top seven spots as Tian
Xiaoxia of Chengdu, Sichuan province, became the sole woman to
break the otherwise clear sweep by the Dalian runners, who took
the bronze medal in 4:14.58.
</P>
<P>
"Our runners are a competitive group," said Lan Lixin, "Coach
Ma has told us prior to the finals to run for the gold medal by
displaying our strength along the track."
</P>
<P>
"And I will run for more medals in my specialities of the 5,
000m and 10,000m later," said 20-year-old budding star.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren stole the limelight in the world track arena in 1993
when his women disciples took titles in the 1993 world
championships in Stuttgart, Germany with two games records.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1993, three world records were created by his
women runners, including Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia, in the 1,500m,
3,000m and 10,000m races at the seventh Chinese National Games in
Beijing.
</P>

KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will send a
team of military officers to join the U.N. Multinational Force for
East Timor to restore order, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia, having reviewed the latest developments in East
Timor including requests by ASEAN member countries particularly
Indonesia, has decided to be part of the Multinational Force," he
said in a statement here.
</P>
<P>
With this view in mind, the Ministry of Defense is organizing a

it is constituted, Syed Hamid said, adding the Multinational Force
will be as authorized by the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1264 (1999) adopted on September 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama news agency, Malaysian Defense Minister
Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha said that the strength of Malaysia's team
of military officers would depend on the U.N. which would

The First Phase Multinational Force would be in East Timor for
six weeks, to be followed by the Second Phase U.N. Peacekeeping
Force, the defense minister said, hoping that the Second Phase
will comprise ASEAN countries under the auspices of the U.N.

He also hoped the U.N. force commander would be an officer from
an ASEAN country as East Timor is in the ASEAN region.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Sell Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Donors have urged the Zambian
government to sell quickly the country's remaining copper mines,
Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia should weigh all options for the purpose of disposing
Nchanga and Nkana mines of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), the donor community was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, both bilateral and multilateral donors
are anxious to see what the government will do next since the
Chilean mining company, Codelco, has pulled out of a partnership
deal with Angol-American Corporation (ACC) last month.
</P>
<P>
ACC reached a memorandum at the end of last month with Zambia
on the purchase of Nchanga and Nkana mines, which account for more
than 60 percent of ZCCM assets. However, no final deal has been
made.
</P>
<P>
The pulling out of the deal by Codelco will further delay
Zambia's privatization process of its ailing mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The International Finance Company (IFC), which is in the
process of contemplating a financial partnership with ACC, is also
on hold, the newspaper quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot say that the IFC is out but they, like everybody
else, are waiting to see what the government will do next," they
said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been trying to privatize its mines in order to get
foreign investment, expertise and advanced management into this
sector.

JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A black lieutenant went

Thursday morning, killing six white soldiers and a female military
employee and injuring five others, South African Press Association

<HEADLINE> Algerians Vote on National Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Algerians began voting
Thursday in a referendum on a plan raised by President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika that is meant to achieve national reconciliation in the
war-torn north African country.
</P>
<P>
The 17.5 million eligible voters will cast their votes in 8,553
polling centers and 38,789 stations across the country, the
Algerian news agency reported. Polls will close at 8:00 p.m. (1900
GMT).
</P>
<P>
The ballot in Thursday's voting asks Algerian voters a single
question: "Do you agree with the steps by the president of the
republic toward civil concord?"
</P>
<P>
National reconciliation has been Bouteflika's top priority
since his election in April.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech on May 29, Bouteflika called for
national reconciliation and taking a new stride towards the
reawakening of national consciousness, to free the nation of the
present crisis and to engage in building a prosperous and just
society with the advent of the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been dogged by a civil war that started in early
1992 after the military-backed government canceled elections that
the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. So far,
100,000 people have died in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In response to Bouteflika's call for national reconciliation,
the Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of the Islamic
Salvation Front, announced on June 6 the end of fighting
definitively and the willingness to use its forces for "the
defense of the people and in the service of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abbas Madani, the founding member of the front who
is serving a 14-year jail term, also presented message to
Bouteflika on June 11, voicing absolute support of the truce
endeavour.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon all his armed men wherever they may be, in
and out of the country, to respect the effort.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Bouteflika's national reconciliation call also drew
wide support among various parties and organizations, which
expressed hope to end the bloodshed and restore security and
stability in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The initiative raised by Bouteflika in July has been passed by
parliament, but he wanted public approval as well. On August 1,
the president signed a decree to hold a referendum on the proposal
on September 16.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the peace plan is an amnesty and reduction
in prison terms for Islamic insurgents found innocent of rape,
murder or planting bombs and provided they give up their weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a goodwill gesture, Bouteflika granted an amnesty Wednesday
to more than 1 million draft dodgers, which would let them get
identity cards necessary for employment and to hold a passport.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika, Algeria's first civilian leader in 24 years, has
said he will resign if voters fail to approve his proposal.

<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Wednesday that
Egypt stands by Syria concerning the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel should withdraw from the Golan Heights,
a strategic plateau Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war, for a comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Education Minister Hussein Bahuddin has said that,
by the end of this year, 25,000 schools nationwide will be
equipped with up-to-date labs and computers that can get access to
internet.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of a new national project of technology
renaissance which President Hosni Mubarak has announced recently
to take Egypt to the 21st century with advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>

Antiquities sector.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Gamal Bayyoumi, Egyptian chief negotiator in talks with the
European Union (EU) on a partnership, has said that the 15-nation
bloc had agreed to increase Egypt's quota of agriculture exports.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the three contentious issues that block Egypt
from being tied up with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Wednesday on the sidelines of the ongoing
Euromoney economic conference. He expected a partnership agreement
with the EU to be reached by January 2,000 at the latest.

ABUJA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Guinea's President Lansana
Conte and Liberian President Charles Taylor has arrived in

</P>
<P>
The border crisis between Liberia and Guinea, among others

Guinea has threatened retaliation against Liberia for the
allegedly killing of 28 villagers by Liberian soldiers on
Saturday near the town of Macenta, on Guinean side of the two
countries borders.
</P>
<P>
But Liberia, while denying its participation in the killing,
accuses Guinea of supporting Liberian rebels who last month

<HEADLINE> Makinen Confident in Mysterious China Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Reigning champion
Tommi Makinen seemed never concerned about the completely unknown
China Rally, which for the first time included in the World Rally
Championship, as the Finn was confident to record a fourth
consecutive victory in the world championship.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quiet confident to win here," said the Mitsubishi driver,
who is comfortably leading the drivers championship with 48 points.
"We are still in a good position in the Champoinship, so I think
this rally could be more difficult for the others than for us."
</P>
<P>
Most of the top drivers have no idea of the only round held in
Asia, with just Colin McRae of Ford and Piero Liatti of SEAT Sport
having experiences of the event, which is held north of Beijing
based in Huairou, close to the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
But Makinen, who has won three rallies this year, was not
worried about the lack of knowledge of the condition. "I don't
think knowing the roads will be so important," He declared.
</P>
<P>
Overnight rain on Wednesday increased the unpredictable vision
on the road, a mixture of gravel and asphalt covered with half-
buried stones and a lot of large rocks, which is one of the
toughest round in the championship as was claimed by every drivers
after recce.
</P>
<P>
McRae's co-driver Nicky Grist said, "Given the very slippery
conditions, it will be a case of a lot more luck than anything
else will help a driver win this rally."
</P>
<P>
While Liatti, who finished second to McRae in last year's China
Rally, thought the experiences in China would play a 10 per cent
advantage coming into the race, which to set off on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both McRae, current sixth in the drivers standings with 23
pionts, and Liatti, who is out of the top ten, almost have no
chance to usurp Makinen in this year's championship, which has
three rounds left after the China Rally.
</P>
<P>
Toyota's team driver Didier Auriol, the closest challenger to
Makinen with 38 points, could not be optimistic to the three-day
event.
</P>
<P>
"I think we need quite a lot of luck for this event," Auriol
said. "I don't really think about the title, I just try to be able
to drive my best in each event. If the title comes it comes, if it
doesn't it doesn't."
</P>
<P>
Auriol's teammate Carlos Sainz shares the third place with
Subaru's veteran Juha Kankkunen on 34 points. Kankkunen has just
won the Finland Rally in an impressive fashion and became one of
the most successive drivers in the 26-year championship with a
record 23 wins.
</P>
<P>
"The surface here is very much like that in Portugal and
Indonesia," Kankkunen said. "The road is very tricky and it's not
so easy (to drive here)."
</P>
<P>
"But it should be good to our car. The car was really going
well in the last rally."
</P>
<P>
Fifth-placed Richard Burns of Subaru has driven in the Hong
Kong-Beijing rally before, but he found no similarity of the two
races.
</P>
<P>
"Before (the rain) we maybe had an advantage knowing how long
the tyres would last in race, but now it is completely different.
So we are on the same footing as everybody else."
</P>
<P>
The China Rally is also the last stop of the prestigious Asian-
Pacific Rally Championship after the Rally de Nouvelle Caledonie
was cancelled.

<HEADLINE> South China Province Leading Reforms, Opening-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- After 2 decades of reforms
in China, Guangdong Province in the South, plans to continue its
role as a pioneer in those reforms and opening up, according to
Governor Lu Ruihua.
</P>
<P>
Lu told Xinhua that Guangdong's reforms and opening up will
concentrate on finance and insurance and allowing a greater market
share to go to overseas retail businesses and financial services.
</P>
<P>
Because of its closeness to Hong Kong, Guangdong has been
designated by the Chinese government as an experimental area for
its opening-up policy to provide experience for other parts of the
country to follow.
</P>
<P>
It has 3 of China's first 4 special economic zones in Shenzhen,
Zhuhai, and Shantou, which led the transition to market controls
in the 1980s and the introduction of reforms in State-owned
enterprises in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up an overseas-oriented economic system
with more than 57,000 overseas-funded companies and over half the
world's top 100 enterprises are in Guangdong in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
That experiment also made the province the country's major
exporter and source of tax revenues and it accounts for some 10
percent of the country's total GDP.
</P>
<P>
The financial reforms are China's newest experiment in
Guangdong of increasing financial reforms and opening-up while
avoiding financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks and insurance companies have already begun
queuing up for a share of the market, and 4 banks in Shenzhen,
which were among the first to be allowed to do the yuan-based
business last year, are considering expanding their business.
</P>
<P>
Overseas retailers are equally interested. The U.S. Wal-Mart,
the first foreign retailer to enter the Chinese mainland three
years ago, has four stores, but it now faces challenges from a
number of competitors like France's Carrefour and Taiwan's Better
Group and Guangdong has become a commercial battle ground for
famous brand names.
</P>
<P>
The foreign competition has stimulated Chinese companies and
Guangdong now has a number of internationally competitive
enterprises with more than 800 branches or companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
To lead the rest of the country and catch up with the world's
industrialized countries in the next century, Guangdong has a goal
of 240 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports and 190 billion U.S.
dollars of overseas investment by the year 2010, the governor
said.

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Codes on Prosecution of Corruption (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua)-- China's highest procuratorate
today promulgated a new set of codes dealing with crimes committed
by officials such as taking bribery, malfeasance, and abuse of
power, and said these crimes shall be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"The new codes relaxed standards on crimes that can be measured
by the amount of illicit money involved, but tightened those on
the deaths or injuries they cause," said Zhang Qiong, deputy
procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, at a
press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"The alterations have been based on China's new realities and
to better facilitate the punishment of corruption according to law,
" Zhang said, noting that the new regulation will help prosecutors
to combat corruption more effectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the new standards, a government employee who has
committed one or more of the following acts shall be investigated
and prosecuted by the public prosecutors:
</P>
<P>
-- embezzling or taking bribes worth more than 5,000 yuan (605
US dollars), or less than 5,000 yuan, but causing dire
consequences;
</P>
<P>
-- misappropriating over 5,000 to 10,000 yuan (1,210 US dollars)
of public funds for illegal activities, or over 10,000 to 30,000
yuan (3,630 US dollars) to seek profit for one's own business,
with the exact amount decided upon by local procuratorates
according to their specific economic situations;
</P>
<P>
-- abusing authority and causing over 200,000 yuan (24,180 US
dollars) of direct economic loss; dereliction of duty, causing
over 300,000 yuan of direct economic loss or one million yuan of
indirect loss.

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Codes on Prosecution of Corruption (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A government department that takes bribes worth more than 100,
000 yuan (12,100 US dollars) shall also be subjected to
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
One of the most notable relaxation of standards is that the
amount for prosecuting the crime of possessing inexplicable
valuable property and concealing secret savings in overseas banks
has been increased from 100,000 yuan (12,100 US dollars) to 300,
000 yuan (36,300 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"It's relatively easy for an official to make up sources for
property worth 100,000 yuan, and it is difficult for prosecutors
to verify the facts today," Zhang explained.
</P>
<P>
Since the perpetrator of the crime of misuse of public power,
which may cause damages to the life and property of citizens, is
more vicious, the new codes list harsher standards for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The 41-page regulation deals with all the crimes listed in the
new criminal code promulgated in 1997, including new names for
some crimes.
</P>
<P>
"The new codes are expected to provide China's procuratorates
with explicit and specific legal bases for combating corruption
crimes, which is key to ensure the proper enforcement of the
relevant provisions in the new penal law," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Plan to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A 180-million-rand
(30-million- dollar) plan to lure an extra three million foreign
tourists to South Africa in the next three years was unveiled in
Pretoria Thursday, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Valli Moosa said the
 initiative was prompted by an urgency to vitalize the tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
"In the past five years we have more than held our market
share, but to leave it to fortune and chance would open the door
to complacency," he said, adding that such an approach would spell
disaster in the competitive world of international tourism.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was expected to bring about 8.5 million tourists
to South Africa by the year 2002, compared with 5.7 million
visiting the country last year.
</P>
<P>
This would push the number of jobs created by tourist
activities from 737,000 last year to more than one million by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Moosa said the plan was the first joint tourism effort by the
government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"Both the private and public sectors have dug deep in their
pockets to raise the money required to fund the plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Business Trust each gave 50 million
rands for the initiative, while the Tourism Business Council would
provide 25 million.
</P>
<P>
Another 45 million rands came from the budget of South African
Tourism (Satour). South African Airways offered 10 million.
</P>
<P>
The first focus of the plan is on short-term marketing
campaigns to boost South Africa's share of tourists from Britain,
the United States, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and France.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Component Parties Urged to Be United for Next Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday called upon ruling Barisan Nasional (BN)
National Front coalition members to treat election candidates from
any of the component parties as BN candidates.
</P>
<P>
Such selfless and cooperative attitude towards one another
would ensure a landslide victory for the BN, which comprises 14
political parties, in the coming general elections, Mahathir, who
is BN chairman, said in Labuan, off Sabah, East Malaysia,
according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
"What's important is upholding the spirit of mutual help and to
regard all candidates as BN candidates and not as representing
individual component party... and we make sure the BN wins,"
Mahathir was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir met 200 leaders of BN component parties in the Labuan
Federal Territory, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the opposition alliance lacked any agenda to
develop the country and it merely came into being to contest in
the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
He said what the opposition parties were doing was to incite
the people to hate the BN and him and to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
The next general election is due to be held by the first half
of next year, but there are wide speculations that the polls will
be held any time this year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has been traveling the country in the last few months,
which was seen as a campaign for the pending general elections.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir on Top of Pakistan's Agenda at UN Session: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Thursday said that besides other issues Kashmir will
be on top of Pakistan's agenda during the next coming General
Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Talking to journalists here, Aziz said India is trying to deny
the Kashmiri people the basic right of self-determination. "We
want to concentrate attention on that, because unless this issue
is resolved the relations between the two countries will not
improve."
</P>
<P>
The entire world realizes that the Kashmir issue should be
resolved through negotiations, he said, adding that "thus
obviously this is our number one issue".
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister is expected to fly to New York Sunday to
attend the annual General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said besides there is the issue of Afghanistan. "We are
trying for the restoration of peace there." But the cooperation of
other countries is essential for that, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are our six neighboring countries plus Russia and
America. This issue will also come under discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Aziz said, there is the Indian nuclear doctrine,
which is dragging Pakistan towards a nuclear arms race. "We shall
highlight the fact that in the present circumstances Indian
nuclear doctrine is not suitable."
</P>
<P>
"We want the world to persuade India to prepare nuclear policy
through mutual consultation. We have already suggested the Nuclear
Free State Regime to India. This is the third issue which will be
discussed there," he said.

<HEADLINE> All Housing Allocations by Former Nigerian Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
revoked controversial housing allocations in Lagos and Abuja by
Former Sani Abacha Administration, Information Minister Chief Dapo
Sarumi said.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided
over by President Olusegun Obasanjo, the minister told reporters
Wednesday in Nigerian capital Abuja that all the housing
allocations were declared invalid after the council reviewed the
presentations by Works and Housing Minister Chief Tony Anenih.
</P>
<P>
Sarumi noted that the revocation was dictated by a need to
redress glaring injustices committed in the past, adding this
action was in line with Obasanjo government's efforts to recover
public funds, media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the council took the decision
because it was discovered that the properties were paid with
public funds.
</P>
<P>
The plots and houses allocated in 1997 were paid with a cheque
issued to the Federal Ministry of Works from the Office of the
National Security Adviser, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that "the allocation cannot be valid",
because " you allocated a plot of house to an individual and he
(or she) used money from the Central Bank of Nigeria to pay."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the most disturbing aspect of the issue was that
five people and two companies who were allocated plots in Lagos
rejected the allocation, but went round to collect the money paid
for them by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Executive Council has directed the five who are all
military officers and the two companies to pay back the money
immediately, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Among those affected by the revocation are former military
chieftains including former Chief of General Staff, former Chief
of Defence Staff and Army, Naval and Air Chiefs.

LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A 52-year-old man was shot
twice in the legs overnight by a masked gunman in his house in
Northern Ireland's second largest city of Londonderry, police said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which occurred just before midnight on Wednesday,
bore the hallmarks of a paramilitary-style shooting.

<P>
The man was treated at hospital and his injuries were not life-

</P>
<P>
So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Major guerrilla groups in Northern Ireland are observing the
ceasefire but so-called punishment beatings and shootings by
Catholic- and Protestant-backed paramilitary groups have continued
and often directed against the groups' own members.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's peace process has been stalled for months by
a dispute between pro-British Protestant and Irish republican
Catholic politicians over guerrilla disarmament and the

communication, paging, and Internet services in China, and results
show that customers think most highly of the paging service, which
garnered an approval rate of 78.54 percent, according to the
survey. Mobile communication and Internet services received good
marks from 73.47 and 56.35 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Complaints about Internet service were mainly on insufficient
speed for surfing the Net, especially while browsing and
downloading, as well as the high cost of the service.
</P>
<P>
While the paging service appears quite satisfactory to most
customers, there are still complaints about mistakes in customers'
messages.
</P>
<P>
Qu Weizhi, vice minister of Information Industry, said there is
still much room for improvement in China's telecom industry,
although it has been on a fast track in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Criticizes Layoff Plan of Michelin Tire Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has criticized the plan of Michelin automobile tire group to lay
off one tenth of its 75,000 work force in Europe, the Agence
France-Presse reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said on Wednesday evening that the "announcement of
Michelin of its intention to cut 7,500 jobs in Europe after a
declaration of profits in the enterprise was inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
Soon after announcing a 20 percent rise of profits in the first
half of 1999, Michelin said last week that it would cut 7,500
people of its work force in Europe in three years.
</P>
<P>
The decision, sharply criticized by the unions, has become a
new dispute between the Socialist government and its ally the
Communist Party. The Communist Party earlier accused the
government of failing to condemn the plan.

<HEADLINE> Lazio President Cragnotti Refuses to Attend Home Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti
says he will no longer attend his side's home matches in Rome's
Olympic Stadium due to an increasingly nasty dispute with the club
's hardcore supporters.
</P>
<P>
"I will not go to the stadium until I am assured that the fan
protests have ended and that these shameful attacks on me and my
family have finished," he told the Rome daily Corriere dello Sport
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti has been strongly criticised by fans for signing a
three-year deal with a travel agency for transport and tickets to
away games in the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
Fans representatives say the agency, which handles 70 percent
of Lazio's ticketing allocation, are charging double the cost of
travelling independently to the game.
</P>
<P>
Lazio supporters are also angry that television rights for
their Champions League games have been sold to pay-per-view
channel Telepiu, meaning even those who don't use the travel
agency and attend the matches must buy a decoder and a
subscription to the channel.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti says he is also upset at the way protests have
included insults against members of his family.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti has spent heavily on new players during his reign at
Lazio and under Swedish coach Sven Goran Eriksson the club have
won the Italian Cup and European Cup Winner's Cup in the past two
seasons as well as qualifying for the current Champions League.

Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>

monsoon rains submerged wide areas in the towns and cities. Many
of the casualties were reported in Antipolo, where houses on the
hillside were destroyed by landslides.
</P>
<P>
Solilapsi said Metro Manila had the largest number of calamity
loan disbursements with 433.08 million pesos (10.8 million U.S.
dollars) released to 54,765 SSS members, the majority of which
were processed at the SSS Quezon City Branch.

Luzon were granted loans totaling 59.16 million pesos (1.48
million dollars).

<HEADLINE> No New Cases of Polio in Western Pacific in 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- No new cases of poliomyelitis
were detected in the Western Pacific region for over two years, a
WHO official said here at the ongoing 50th Session of the World
Health Organization Regional Committee for the Western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real credit to all member states, especially those
who have until recently suffered from the burden of poliomyelitis",
said Dr. Shigeru Omi, director of the regional committee.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of the regional committee is being held in
Macao from September 13 to 17 with the participation of more than
100 representatives from the region.
</P>
<P>
WHO launched a poliomyelitis eradication initiative in 1988
when the World Health Assembly, WHO's global governing body,
resolved to eradicate the disease by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
At its 39th session in September 1988, the Regional Committee
for the Western Pacific also adopted a resolution on the
eradication of poliomyelitis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The last polio case in the region, a 15-month-old Cambodian
girl, was identified on March 19, 1997. Since then, no new cases
of poliomyelitis have been reported.
</P>
<P>
"I can inform you that the quality of surveillance has been
maintained at the highest level throughout the region. That is why
I can be confident in saying that the transmission of wild
poliovirus has finally been interrupted," Omi said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, "This will not yet be the end of the
story for poliomyelitis eradication. Our region will have to
maintain surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) until
global certification, in order to guard against re-introduction of
imported wild poliovirus, as long as it circulates anywhere in the
world."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the investment in human resources that has been part
of the poliomyelitis eradication initiative, many countries have
improved their immunization coverage and strengthened their
communicable disease surveillance systems.
</P>
<P>
"Poliomyelitis is a disease of the 20th century that will no
longer trouble us in the 21st century, but the legacy of its
eradication will live on," Omi said.

<HEADLINE> Too Many Phone Calls Feared to Hinder Y2K Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National
Telecommunication Commission (NTC) is urging the public to refrain
from making unnecessary telephone calls during the Y2K transition
period to avoid overloading the telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Dacanay, NTC representative in a forum on Y2k readiness
held here Thursday morning, said telecommunications networks might
be overloaded during the computer date-change period.
</P>
<P>
This may happen, Dacanay said, "when people might be impelled
to use the telephones simultaneously out of curiosity or to seek
assurances of safety, comfort and peace during the transition
period."
</P>
<P>
Should an overload occur, Dacanay said, the telecommunication
firms will implement call-dropping. "If it becomes absolutely
necessary, the networks will drop calls to prevent an overload,"
he explained.
</P>
<P>
"This means the telephone firm will deliberately drop your
call, that is, not process it so that you are not able to get
connected to the number you dialed," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Dacanay asked the public to refrain from making unnecessary
phone calls during the last few days of December 1999 up to the
first week of January 2000, the rollover period of the computer
glitch called the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug, also called the millennium bug, is a weakness in
old-model computer systems which cannot read or recognize the
numbers 2000 since their microchip processors were programmed to
read only up to 1999.
</P>
<P>
Dacanay, however, said the country's telecommunications
computer networks are "l00 percent Y2K compliant" as of August 30,
l999.
</P>
<P>
"The telecommunications sector is in its highest state of Y2K
readiness. Almost all telephone carriers are Y2K ready," he
assured, citing as examples telephone giant Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Company, Globe Telecoms, Smart Communications,
Islacom and Extelcom.
</P>
<P>
Others, like Bayantel, are fast-tracking their remediation
efforts to be Y2K compliant before the end of October 1999, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The provincial telecommunications sector has, up to this date,
only 13,000 lines which are not yet Y2K compliant, a small number
when taken in the context of 5 million lines nationwide, Dacanay
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He further assured of continued and uninterrupted telephone
service during the Y2K rollover period under normal usage and
operations.
</P>
<P>
Barring an abnormal hike in the number of calls,
telecommunications service will remain available even during
possible power or energy interruptions because all
telecommunication service providers have their own back-up power
supply, Dacanay said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal-Bhutan Talks Made Some Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Nepal-Bhutan
Joint Ministerial Level Committee (JMLC) meeting on the Bhutanese
refugee crisis produced no resolution, though it made some
positive progress, said Nepali Foreign Minister Ram Mahat after
the talks ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahat told reporters that the positive progress is that Bhutan
made concessions on the categorization of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bhutan agreed to treat refugees of category 2 in
the same terms as category one.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese refugees were divided into four categories in the
first round of ministerial talks between Nepal and Bhutan in 1993.
The four categories are: bonafide Bhutanese who were forcibly
evicted, Bhutanese who emigrated on compelling circumstance,
non-Bhutanese and Bhutanese with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
The second category of refugees has been the obstacle in the
previous talks. Bhutan had refused to take back these refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The other positive side is that they also agreed to go ahead
with free verification, but we had different opinions as to what
should be free verification," said Mahat.
</P>
<P>
"We want to go on a camp-by-camp basis," he said, adding that
Bhutan wanted to verify some part of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said they had left this difference at the talks in Bhutan
that will come very soon.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be continued in Thimpu in November, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan Foreign Minister Jigme Y. Thinley said after the talks
that they had achieved substantial results.
</P>
<P>
"We have a mechanism (on verification) in place, which
comprises five members from each side, and will conduct the
verification on the form that had already been agreed upon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are 100,000 Bhutanese refugees living in eastern Nepal
after they were evicted from Bhutan around 1990. Seven rounds of
ministerial talks between the two Himalayan kingdoms failed to
reach any solutions.
</P>
<P>
The 7th JMLC meeting held in Kathmandu in 1996 ended in impasse
as Nepal insisted on the repatriation of all refugees, while
Bhutan wanted to take back only those who were forcibly evicted,
mainly the first category of refugees.

<P>
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Criticized for its lack of action facing the crisis in East
Timor, the United Nations adopted on Wednesday with unanimity a
resolution authorizing the sending of a multinational force to
Dili to restore order and peace. According to various sources, the
peacekeeping force, which will be manned by from 7,000 to 8,000
soldiers, will disembark in Timor this weekend from Australia.
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, the number three of the
Islamic Salvation Front of Algeria, Abdelkader Hachani, expressed
his reserve about the referendum of national reconciliation to be
held in the country on Thursday. He said that Algerians cannot
reconcile with each other unless the responsibility of everybody
in the seven-year violence is made clear.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After seven years of violence perpetrated by armed Islamic
groups which has killed more than 100,000 people, the Algerians
are appealed on Thursday to vote on the law of "civil concord"
aimed at pardoning all the Islamists except those who have killed
and raped. The announcement of clemency which will end by January
13 has not attracted massively the armed groups, as only from 250
to 300 of their members have surrendered to the government so far.
</P>
<P>
-- After the green light given by the United Nations Security
Council, the soldiers of a multinational force are expected to
arrive at East Timor this weekend.

LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Gordon Brown, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave his
most upbeat assessment of Britain's economic prospects on
Wednesday and predicted that growth could rise above 3 percent
within 18 months, which will be the highest since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's Chancellor Gordon Brown will on Thursday strongly
endorse the Bank of England's controversial decision to raise
interest rates last week, a move likely to antagonize employers
and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- It is too late to stop the first stages of global warming,
the destruction of thousands of the world's species or prevent
shortages of water across swathes of Africa and Asia that could
provoke wars over the next 25 years, according to a UNEP report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of peacekeeping troops were preparing to be
airlifted into East Timor on Wednesday to face militia groups
opposed to their arrival after the U.N. approved a multinational
force with the authority to use "all necessary measures."
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair came under intense
pressure from some of the Labor Party's biggest financial backers
to prepare Britain for early entry into the single European
currency.

<HEADLINE> PECC Sets Up Eco-Friendly Residential Area in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council recently displayed an eco-friendly residential
area in north China's Tianjin Municipality during its first
International Trade and Investment Fair in the city.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the four-day fair, which started Tuesday, is "
Environment and Living Space in the 21st Century." The
residential area, built in the Tianjin Economic Development Area,
is a combination of Eastern and Western architectural styles with
25 completed single buildings and 18 varieties of outstanding
apartments open to the fair's visitors.
</P>
<P>
The 200,000-square-meter residential area, built by architects
from 18 countries and regions including the USA, Australia, Japan,
Holland, the Philippines, New Zealand, Britain, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, are furnished with hi-tech, energy-saving, and eco-
friendly household electrical appliances and materials.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Ministry of Construction said they have
approved the area as a base to publicize real estate with new
technology and style in order to inspire enterprises both at home
and abroad to develop apartments and houses suitable for China's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 355 enterprises from 28 countries and regions are
attending the fair, among which are many well-known eco-friendly
apartment developers.
</P>
<P>
They will negotiate on some 272 cooperative projects, and there
will be seminars on investment and markets, water-pollution
prevention, and the environment and habitats.
</P>
<P>
The PECC, established in Australia in September 1980, now has
23 member states providing consultation and negotiation on
economic cooperation and development in the Pacific region. China
became a member of the council in September 1986.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Spend Hundreds of Millions on E.Timor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's participation in
the security force in East Timor would cost several hundred
million Australian dollars, Defense Minister John Moore said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"As to the precise amount, it is pretty hard to estimate,"
Moore told reporters. "But, certainly the cost will run to some
hundreds of millions."
</P>
<P>
Asked about reports it would cost Australia between 300 million
Australian dollars (198 million U.S. dollars) and 400 million
Australian dollars (264 million U.S. dollars) to get underway, he
said: "That wouldn't be unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
His comments came after Treasurer Peter Costello said
Australia's involvement would have significant cost to the budget.
</P>
<P>
"It will take new expenditure," Costello said in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The budget was in surplus and it was the government's aim to
keep it in surplus, Costello said.
</P>
<P>
"It will mean spending will have to be tightened in other
areas," Costello added.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of ASEAN Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies met here Thursday at their 10th
conference to discuss urgent humanitarian aid to East Timor
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Red Crescent Society Chairman Abdul Hamid Omar told
reporters that Indonesian Red Cross Secretary-General Soesanto
Mangoensadjito would brief the meeting on the latest situation in
violence-torn East Timor and the type of aid needed.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of Malaysia and in the ASEAN spirit, we are ready to
assist in whatever way we can," Hamid said. "Time is important. We
can't wait that long to extend relief aid for fear that the
situation in East Timor will deteriorate."
</P>
<P>
East Timor badly needed supply of blood, respiratory equipment
and medication for skin diseases, Soesanto said, adding a fire
three months ago destroyed a blood bank in Jakarta where 500,000
pints of blood were stored.
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate the cooperation and humanitarian aid
extended by neighboring countries to alleviate the human problems
in East Timor," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Have Good Wet-Season Rice Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's wet-season rice
crop this year is expected to exceed 3 million tons, more than
last year's, according to the forecast of the Agriculture
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said Thursday that if the rain is good
until the end of the wet season it could yield a good rice crop
and with many thousand tons of surplus.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia produced more than 3 million tons of rice in 1998,
with more than 2.8 million tons harvested in the wet season.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is based on this year's minimal damage so far to
the country's wet season rice crop from flooding, drought and
insects. Cambodia's wet season begins from May to November every

</P>
<P>
Flood and drought have damaged about 12,000 hectares of paddies
since May, the Cambodia Daily said, but only 81 hectares of
paddies have been damaged by hopper-grass and caterpillars in
Kompong Cham province, compared to thousands of hectares of
paddies destroyed in Takeo, Kompong Speu and Kompong Cham in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the good crop prospects, the Cambodian government will not
ban the export of rice this year. More than that it will seek to
find overseas markets for the surplus.

<HEADLINE> Former Nigerian First Family Warned Over Allegedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian authorities have
warned wife and son of the late Head of State Sani Abacha against
sabotaging government's efforts to recover public funds allegedly
stashed in foreign banks by the family.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguard, a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported Thursday
that Mrs. Abacha and her son Mohammed Abacha were summoned Tuesday
to the capital Abuja by the Office of the Chief Security Adviser
to the President, where they were interrogated and released after
some hours.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a presidency source as saying that Mrs. Abacha
had indeed attempted to fly out of the country last weekend but
was stopped by security agents acting on "instruction from above".
</P>
<P>
The two key figures of the former first family were barred from
 travelling abroad until the recovery of the looted money.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources as saying that government was aware of
alleged plans of the Abacha family to cause public disaffection
through riots and protests.
</P>
<P>
"The government is quite aware of the fundamental rights of its
citizens but will not allow any act by any individual that will
disturb the public peace, " the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Abachas began contacting some powerful individuals in and
outside the country to plead their case with government as soon as
they received the summon to report at Aso Rock, Nigeria's
president villa, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Abacha is back in Kano, where her family is located, from
Abuja after giving an undertaking to be law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Lt.-Gen. Aliyu Mohammed recently
traveled to Europe to recover some of the money allegedly hidden
in foreign banks by the Abachas and aides to the late head of
state.

PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 17.5 million Algerian
voters began to vote Thursday morning on a law seeking national
reconciliation after seven years of violence killed more than 100,

</P>
<P>
The government has mobilized 400,000 agents to ensure the
smooth process of the voting, the result of which will be

</P>
<P>
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has appealed to Algerians to
vote for his "civil concord" law aimed at giving clemency to all
Islamists except those who have enrolled in killing or raping.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Bouteflika said that this "
demarche of peace" is the only way to let Algeria go out of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Widely expected to be approved, the civil concord law is valid
for six months until January 13 for Islamists who want to benefit
for the clemency measures.
</P>

So far, about 300 armed Islamists have surrendered to the
government, said Algerian Prime Minister Smail Hamdani.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Liberation, the number

<HEADLINE> Ancient "Underground Treasure House" Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China hailed another momentous
event in its archeological history by announcing today the
excavation of a large "underground treasure house" some 20
kilometers north of the ancient city of Xi'an, capital of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
A decade-long excavation has revealed that the "underground
treasure house" is actually the burial site, known as Yangling, of
Liu Qi, the fourth emperor of the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-
24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The many pits associated with the emperor's tomb contain large
quantities of colored pottery animals as well as terra-cotta
warriors and horses.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest collection of pottery animals ever
unearthed since the founding of new China in 1949," said Zhao
Dequan, vice governor of Shaanxi, at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the serious demeanor of the terra-cotta warriors and
horses found at the tomb of Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of the
Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.), the pottery at Yangling are lovely
small animals including meek lambs, naive pigs and long-eared
wolfhounds.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, 90 burial pits have been found in the 12-
square-kilometer rectangular cemetery dominated by the emperor's
tomb.
</P>
<P>
On the eastern side of the cemetery are 28 pits containing
terra-cotta sheep, dogs, pigs and colored terra-cotta infantrymen,
cavalrymen, chariots and horses.
</P>
<P>
The 21 pits along both the northern and western sides contain
large numbers of articles for daily use, as well as cavalrywomen,
something that has never before been found. Excavations will
continue in the 20 pits on the southern side of the site to
determine what is in them.
</P>
<P>
In addition, archeologists have discovered 10,000 burial pits
in a 3.5-square-kilometer attendant cemetery one kilometer east of
Liu Qi's tomb. Over 5,000 cultural relics have been unearthed
from 280 pits there, said Jiao Nanfeng, leader of the
archeological team.
</P>
<P>
Other brilliant achievements of the excavation include the
discovery of China's earliest chessboard and the largest tile made
in the Han Dynasty at the ruins of Sanchu Gate, a gate-tower
symbolizing the imperial ranks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts describe the current discovery at Yangling as
the country's most comprehensive excavation of an imperial tomb
built in the Han Dynasty. It not only has high academic value, but
also will be easily turned into a new tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition displaying the treasures unearthed at the
Yangling Tomb will be opened to visitors at the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Lee Teng-hui's New Move Deserves Serious Attention (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan mass media pointed out that the nature of the so-
called "basic law or fundamental law" is a "Taiwan independence
constitution."
</P>
<P>
These moves indicate that although Lee Teng-hui failed to get
on the agenda the incorporation of his "two states" remarks into
the constitution, he is determined to choose a successor within
the framework of his separatist line.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, some members of the Democratic
Progressive Party announced the formation of a "new constitution
working group" on September 7 and plan to push ahead the drafting
and formulation of the "new constitution" before Lee Teng-hui's
term of office expires next May.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has been continuing to advocate his "two-states"
position on various occasions in Taiwan, and the commentary says
that it is very hard for him to change his ideas, and he will go
on making trouble.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that "we should be on high alert over Lee's new
moves, and we will deal a head-on blow to whatever bad thing he
does."
</P>
<P>
The commentary also appeal to the Taiwan people to be prudent
and not to follow Lee Teng-hui, as some mass media on the Taiwan
Island have pointed out that the "constitutional amendment" would
mean the start of calamities for the people of Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Lee Teng-hui's New Move Deserves Serious Attention (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency issued a
commentator's article today, which is titled "Lee Teng-hui's New
Move Deserves Serious Attention."
</P>
<P>
The commentator's article said a series of events with
connections in Taiwan have drawn the close attention of people,
and these event are all concerning Lee Teng-hui's advocacy of a
separatist policy.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was Lee Teng-hui who manipulated events behind the
scenes, and these events also betrayed countless links between Lee
Teng-hui and the Democratic Progressive Party, which has been bent
on the independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The "Third National Assembly" adopted a bill on September 4
extending its term of office by over two years, from the original
May 18, 2000, to June 30, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The mass media in Taiwan reacted strongly on learning of this,
and some called the term extension a rarely seen farce "putting
money into one's own pocket," as each "congressman" can receive an
annual salary of more tan 6 million Taiwan yuan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan media reports revealed that the adoption of the bill
was a plot carefully planned by the Kuomintang and the Democratic
Progressive Party, and that Lee Teng-hui knew all about it before
the bill was passed.
</P>
<P>
Some said that the final goal of the "extension of the term of
office bill" is to "freeze the current constitution and draft a
Taiwan basic law."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Israel to Renounce Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has reiterated a call on Israel to renounce nuclear
weapons, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear acquisition and capabilities would not stand Israel
in good stead, Mubarak said on Wednesday in an interview with The
Armed Forces newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I think all the countries in the world have the conviction
that Israel must get rid of its nuclear weaponry if it really
wishes to live in security and peace, and is keen on maintaining
regional stability," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel is widely believed to have developed nuclear weapons.
But it has neither confirmed nor denied the allegation, and
refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, becoming the
first Arab country to do so. However, over the years a wall of
mistrust still remained between the two neighbors, with each
expressing concern over the other's purchase of advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Why do Israelis talk about Egypt's military power and do not
talk about the development of their defense?" Mubarak asked.
</P>
<P>
He conditioned Egypt's signing of a ban on chemical weapons on
Israel's signing of NPT.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will continue to develop and modernize its armed forces,
but it has no intention to be engaged in an arms race with any
other country, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is a great country that keeps its obligations and
complies with its pacts but at the same time it is capable of
protecting itself," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia: ASEAN Should Play Role in Resolving E. Timor Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN)
action in asking Australia to head the peacekeeping force in East
Timor is not a good development, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries should be given preference to play a role
in resolving the dispute and conflict in East Timor as Indonesia
was a member of the regional body, Syed Hamid said in the southern
city of Johor Baharu Wednesday night, Bernama news agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia felt that Australia had been hasty in offering itself
to head the multinational force to be sent to East Timor, he said
when asked to comment on reports that UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan had asked Australia to head the peacekeeping force in East
Timor despite objections from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said any contingent joining the peacekeeping force
should have the confidence of all parties including the people of
East Timor itself.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia, as an ASEAN member, should also be careful if
Australia headed the multinational force as it feared many
problems would have to be faced including rejection by the local
people.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is...we have to instill confidence... that
the countries involved in the peacekeeping force are stable
countries and not one-sided and at the same time able to
discharge their duties and responsibilities well," the foreign
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia, nevertheless, was ready to send its
peacekeeping force under the auspices of the UN and was waiting
further instructions from the world body.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would also give humanitarian aid to the people of East
Timor, Syed Hamid said, adding the form and method, however, had
not been decided yet.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: CPC Meeting to Design Future of State-Owned Sector ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) will soon have clear directions as to what they
should do, and there is every indication that the 4th Plenary
Session of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China will work out solutions to issues critical to the fate of
SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Included in the package to be formulated at the meeting are
measures for streamlining the state sector and steering them
toward more a market orientation.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Beijing say that the meeting, which will open on
Sunday, will have a far-reaching impact on the development of
China's state-owned sector in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Holding the meeting on the eve of the 50th birthday of the
People's Republic fully demonstrates the CPC Central Committee's
high attention to the reform and development of state-owned
enterprises. Authoritative analysts predict that a range of
strategic decisions will be formulated to promote the reform of
SOEs.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin has made
quite a number of inspection tours this year, and chaired five
forums in different areas especially on SOE reform and development,
a move rarely seen before.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the state-owned economy in the national
economy determines the significance of SOE reforms. Among the
urban employed population, 60 percent are in the state-owned
sector, while 55 percent of state financial revenues come from
SOEs.

<TEXT>
<P>
One thing is clear, people expecting overall privatization in
China will continue to be disappointed. The dominating status of
the publicly owned economy is protected by the national
constitution, and it is a critical tool by which the central
government drives and regulates economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Only a month ago, President Jiang Zemin reiterated a month ago
that China "will never practice privatization. This is a major
principle that allows not a bit wavering."
</P>
<P>
Under this principle, China's reform has always been pursued in
a pragmatic way. Since the early 1980s, SOE reforms have
experienced step-by-step progress, from delegating power and
allowing enterprises to retain more profits to contracted
operations. In the 1990s, SOE reforms advanced into a new stage of
system remolding.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of reforms has uncovered many problems
accumulated from the past. Some SOEs failed to adapt to the rules
of a market economy and are trapped in difficulties, while some
others are suffering from either obsolete technologies or
irrational structures and heavy debt pressures.
</P>
<P>
These difficulties have not forced the Chinese to bow. Rather,
sober-minded policy makers recognized that SOE reform is the key
knot that must be untied for successful economic system reform,
hence the goal of freeing most large- and medium-sized SOEs from
difficulties in three years time.

<P>
Over the past two years, the central government held high the
policy of encouraging corporate mergers, standardizing bankruptcy
procedures, diverting laid-off workers, and increasing efficiency
by downsizing staff, in order to produce a competitive mechanism
that selects the superior and eliminates the inferior.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the state's policies of stimulating domestic demand,
the overall condition of SOEs began to turn for the better in the
first half this year, with the rate of growth accelerated and
profits nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
After years of theoretical study and practical research, a
blueprint has taken shape for the state-owned sector to develop
under market conditions. Chinese officials and economists
generally hold that it is a must for SOEs to establish a modern
enterprise system that is suited to market mechanisms in an all-
round way.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they asserted that this is the time to put an
end to the malady of managing enterprises directly by the
government. The ongoing government restructuring is expected to
result in a genuine separation of government functions from
business operations.
</P>
<P>
Specific research of the problems faced by SOEs is also
progressing. Two weeks ago, Beijing saw the first case of
converting bank credit rights to equity in an SOE, a practice
believed to effectively cut enterprise debt burden.
</P>
<P>
In some places, the system of yearly payment for enterprise
managers or the practice of offering them share options are also
on trial. Managers of SOEs will be paid much more than their old
salary if they can make the enterprises profitable.

<P>
Authoritative analysts point out that when these trials prove
successful, they will certainly be widely spread in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
They hold that the strategic readjustment of the national
economy and strategic restructuring of SOEs will comprise the
major part of China's economic reform and development for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
Since the 15th National Congress of the CPC in 1997, it has
become a common view that the over-extended state-owned sector
must be compressed. The green light will still be given to
industries and areas that are critical to the lifeline of national
economy, while enterprises suffering from overproduction, low
efficiency, and waste will inevitably be annexed or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
How to give full play to human resources is another urgent
issue that needs resolution. To ensure the healthy development of
the national economy in the next century, China needs large
numbers of high-quality management personnel. Technological
innovation and high-tech industrial development are also critical
for raising China's comprehensive national strength.
</P>
<P>
In fact, policy makers have had unprecedented insight in these
respects, which is evidenced by the national technological
innovation conference held last month, and a range of other
related measures.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the Chinese people do not expect SOE
reforms to be accomplished in a limited time. While stressing the
importance and urgency of SOE reforms, Jiang Zemin reminded people
that they should "know the long-lasting and hard nature of the
work."
</P>
<P>
Through having witnessed the great changes in China over the
past 20 years, people have every reason to believe in the country'
s determination, confidence, and capability in creating new
conditions for SOEs through reforms and development.

<HEADLINE> Multi-National Force Consists of 7,000-12,000: Indonesian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
multi-national force in East Timor would consist of 7,000 to
12,000 personnel and be led by an Australian commander and a
Malaysian as deputy commander, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
"The first contingent of the force would be deployed in East
Timor at the latest as of next Monday (September 20). Aside from
the Australian contingent, the first batch of the force would also
consist of three to four ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) countries, including Malaysia and the Philippines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Antara News Agency reporters in New York on
Wednesday night, Alatas said although Indonesia does not impose
any conditions on the composition for the multi-national force,
Indonesia prefers ASEAN contingents over an Australian one.
</P>
<P>
This is because there are some problems with Australia which
are seen by some camps in Indonesia as too eager and provocative,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said based on the U.N. experience and tradition,
usually the commander is selected from the country with the
biggest contribution of personnel, equipment and finance.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason the U.N. selected Australia to lead the
multi-national force, as it is the most ready in any aspect.
</P>
<P>
Among the nations having expressed readiness to deploy their
forces are Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, South Korea,
Britain and some European and African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Alatas, Australia is not the only nation that can
lead the multi-national force, but as other countries are facing
financial problems in the deployment, thus Australia was chosen as
the commander.
</P>
<P>
And as this is different from the traditional peace-keeping
force which is financed by the U.N., the multi-national force
would be financed by those involved in the operation, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
This multi-national force has a wide mandate, including using
weapons to restore peace. The force is also given mandate to use
all efforts needed to implement its mandate, including killing the
pro-integration militia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the deployment of the multi-national force does not
mean the Indonesian Military (TNI) would be withdrawn from the
territory. Now, a discussion is going on about how the
8,000-member TNI would take part in the operation.
</P>
<P>
There is a big possibility that TNI will function as liaison
officers, as the task of restoring peace and order would be taken
by the multi-national force. TNI is now only supporting, and not
the operational organizer.

<HEADLINE> Howard Unconcerned by Australia-Indonesia Treaty Cancellation </HEADLINE>

<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Thursday said he did not pay much regard to
Indonesia's decision to scrap a four-year-old security treaty
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Australian government officials said the Australia-Indonesia
security treaty, signed in December 1995, was canceled by the
Indonesian government on Thursday.
</P>

Howard said Indonesia's move was expected given the tense state

<HEADLINE> China Takes Lead in Fishing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Years ago, fish was still a
luxury to most Chinese citizens. Nowadays, aquatic products have
become bread and butter on most dining tables.
</P>
<P>
China has lead the world's fishing industry for ten years in a
row, and its per capita fish production has exceeded the world's
average since 1995.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Chinese market now abounds in aquatic products
of every kind.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the
country turned out 39 million tons of aquatic products in 1998, 75
times the 1949 figure.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Bureau of Fisheries under the Ministry of
Agriculture attribute this substantial increase to the rapid
growth of aquiculture.
</P>
<P>
Over the past fifty years, China has expanded its aquiculture
from coastal regions and regions along the major rivers including
the Yangtze and the Pearl, to the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Areas for aquiculture in China amounted to 6.07 million ha. in
1998 with per hectare output hitting 3,600 kg, up from 1,077 kg in
1952.
</P>
<P>
Also, the total breeding output of aquatic products has
increased from 400,000 tons in 1952 to 21.8 million tons in 1998,
making China the only country whose breeding industry outstrips
its fishing industry among major fishing nations.
</P>
<P>
China's fishing output stands at 17.3 million tons at present,
9.4 times the 1954 figure.
</P>
<P>
However, in a bid to protect marine resources, the Chinese
government initiated a summer fishing ban in the East China Sea
and the Yellow Sea in 1995. This year, the ban was extended to the
South China Sea with the goal of freezing the growth of the
country's offshore fishing output.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the fishing ban has paid off as
China's offshore fishing output declined by 220,000 tons in the
first half of this year compared with the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese auto giant Honda
says it is impressed with the pioneering spirit the Chinese have
shown during cooperative business deals.
</P>
<P>
"After several years of cooperation, the open-minded and career-
minded Chinese people have made a deep impression on us," Kadowaki
Koji, general manager of Guangzhou Honda Automobile Co. Ltd., said
in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Honda is full of confidence for the future cooperation with
the Chinese partners," Kadowaki said.
</P>
<P>
After its success in motorcycle manufacturing in Guangzhou,
Honda invested in the production of a popular style car there.
</P>
<P>
Honda started its cooperation with the Chinese in the 1970s,
after attending the China export commodity fair held annually in
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, a joint venture was established for making
motorcycles. However, the auto industries in Guangzhou were
granted bank loans of only three million yuan (361,000 U.S.
dollars) a year and lacked professional management or skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
Honda, a leading automobile manufacturer in the world, worried
about the quality of products here, Kadowaki said.
</P>
<P>
Honda's first involvement with Chinese automakers was in the
introduction of technology only. In 1987, Honda sent two samples
and some key fittings to the Guangzhou auto plant which Guangzhou
workers copied.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Probes Kisangani Clash with Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Army High Command
has formed a new inquiry team to investigate the causes of August
14-17 armed clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan troops in
Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The new committee, composed of five members and chaired by
State Minister for Defense Steven Kavuma, began work Tuesday, one
day after the High Command rejected the report presented at the
weekend by Army Commander Jeje Odongo, the New Vision newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The committee also includes State Minister for Regional
Cooperation Amama Mbabazi, former State Minister for Defense David
Tinyefuza, Deputy Chief of Military Intelligence Noble Mayombo and
President Yoweri Museveni' s principal Private Secretary in charge
of the military James Mugiira.
</P>
<P>
The new inquiry team was given the task to study the previous
report and establish whether the report was genuine and to address
all areas of complaints.
</P>
<P>
The High Command meeting on Monday chaired by President
Museveni expressed disappointment with the report, describing it
as shallow and compromised.
</P>
<P>
The Odongo report, compiled jointly with a Rwandan team,
accuses Uganda of provoking the shoot-out in which hundreds of
people including soldiers from both sides were killed.
</P>
<P>
A joint investigation team was formed two days after President
Museveni and Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame met on August 17
in western Uganda over the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the Odongo report are still kept secret in
Kampala while Paul Kagame promised to publish the report when he
addresses the Rwandan Parliament Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Electric Appliance Exports to Grow 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua)-- Exports of major household
electrical appliances increased remarkably in the first half this
year, laying a solid foundation for achieving the goal for the
entire year.
</P>
<P>
The sector is targeted to earn 3.9 billion U.S. dollars in
exports this year, which would be up 10 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the State Administration of Light Industry said
that from January to June, household air conditioners brought in
280 million U.S. dollars in export revenue, a 56 percent growth
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of microwave ovens, electric pans, and refrigerators
also saw an 30 percent increase, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China is the third-largest household electrical
appliance market in the world, with sales here accounting for 10
percent of the world's total. Almost 90 percent of the country's
exports in this category went to North American, Asia, and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fuzhong, an official with China's Household Electric
Appliance Association, said that the sector is undergoing major
restructuring with the focus on technological renovation.
</P>
<P>
Domestic enterprises have increased technological input from 3
percent two years ago to 8 percent at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
China recently announced more incentives, such as bank loans,
to encourage domestic enterprises to set up factories and sales
outlets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Chunlan Group and the Haier Group, China's two major air
conditioner and refrigerator providers, signed deals with Russia
and the United States early this year, and their overseas
factories are now under construction.
</P>
<P>
Global household electric appliance sales are growing by 6
percent annually, and total sales will exceed 250 billion yuan (
about 30.22 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of this year, experts
predict.

The results surprised and pleased the Japanese investors, who

Ltd. Kadowaki, who was Honda's chief representative for the
Beijing office, was sent to Guangzhou to head the car-
manufacturing joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Early on, the Chinese workers did not realize the importance of
high quality, and their style contradicted the Japanese management
's concept of quality, said Kadowaki, who studied Chinese culture
at university.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese finally accepted the strict quality standards set
by Honda, he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of motorcycles from Wuyang-Honda now stands
at 350,000, with over 98 percent being sold.
</P>
<P>
"Wuyang-Honda is a good example of cooperation between Japan
and China," Kadowaki said, adding that Honda plans to expand
cooperation here.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China's southern economic powerhouse
Guangdong has several automobile parts plants, which Honda regards
as helpful to its work.
</P>
<P>
Kadowaki estimates the annual output of cars in his plant to be
10,000 by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Ready for World Habitat Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's port city of
Dalian is now ready for this year's World Habitat Day celebrations
on October 4, according to the preparatory office.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time these global celebrations will be held
in China since 1985, when the United Nations General Assembly
designated the first Monday of October as "World Habitat Day."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitats)
chose Dalian for the event because of its achievements in urban
construction and environmental protection, Zhang Yonglin, head of
the preparatory office, told a press conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the center gave this year's U.N. Habitat award to
Dalian's Mayor Bo Xilai for his notable contributions to the city'
s housing construction and sustainable habitat environment.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "Cities for All," this year's World Habitat Day
is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Constructions and
the Dalian municipal government.
</P>
<P>
More than 350 people, including high-ranking U.N. officials,
foreign ambassadors to China, Chinese government officials, and
the mayors of 35 Chinese cities, will attend the celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Feathered Galloping Dinosaur, Ancestor of Bird (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A fossil recently discovered
in China indicates that a kind of feathered, meat-eating dinosaur,
adept at running, may be the ancestor of birds.
</P>
<P>
In today's British authoritative academic journal "Nature,"
Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing and his colleagues published their
recent discovery of a fossilized feathered dinosaur, called
Sinornithosaurus, which may date back 124.6 million years.
</P>
<P>
"Without doubt, it was a dinosaur, not a bird. But compared
with other feathered dinosaurs discovered in recent years, the
Sinornithosaurus has a closer connection with birds," Xu Xing, 30,
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Unearthed in Beipiao City in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, the fossilized dinosaur belonged to the dromaeosaurid
family, and the skeletal structure of the 1.2-meter-long dinosaur
has many characteristics of early birds.
</P>
<P>
"Its shoulder girdle is the same as the archaeopteryx, the
earliest bird discovered in Germany," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"Although Sinornithosaurus could not fly, its bone structure
was adapted to flying, and its forelimbs could flap in both sides
of the body, a prerequisite for flight," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the Sinornithosaurus' body to its quarters
indicates that it could run fast, according to Xu.

<TEXT>
<P>
The meat-eating dinosaur lived on small mammals and lizards.
When some dinosaurs were running to catch quarries, their
forelimbs flapped to increase the speed, and then evolved for
flight, some paleontologists conjecture.
</P>
<P>
United States scientist Philip Burgers has calculated that the
archaeopteryx could run at a speed of seven meters per second by
flapping their forelimbs, exceeding the lowest speed required for
flight, six meters per second.
</P>
<P>
"Another conclusion of our research is that feathers are not
unique to birds. The development of feathers was earlier than the
origin of birds," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
So far, scientists have found five kinds of feathered-dinosaur
fossils in the western region of Liaoning Province, and these
fossils represent different stages in the evolution from dinosaur
to bird, according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
Another paleontologist, Zhang Fucheng, also of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, said a larger number of academics worldwide
now favor the view that birds originated from dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
"But the evolution of life is a complicated procedure, and a
definitive conclusion requires more evidence," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The "feathered dinosaur" has become a hot topic in
international scientific circles. This year, scientists at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology
and Paleoanthropology have published four articles about feathered
dinosaur in the journal "Nature".

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Pledge to Treat Passengers Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. major airlines,
under pressure from government-threatened reform and passengers
frustrated by delay, lost luggage and mounting travel woes, on
Wednesday disclosed detailed plans to become more user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, pledged to
deploy mobile, battery-powered workstations at all its hub
airports so that when there are flight delays or other problems,
agents can wheel the "Mobile Chariots" and help with rebooking
passengers.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines, the second largest, said it had "developed
detained contingency plans at every domestic airport" to deal with
that same kind of situation.
</P>
<P>
Both American and United said they would advise a passenger if
a flight is overbooked at the time a reservation is made, if the
passenger wants to know. In general the carriers also backed a
change in regulations which would increase the liability limit for
lost luggage beyond the current ceiling of 1,250 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Continental Airlines, which already rates high in
passenger-satisfaction surveys, promised to do better by
communicating more clearly -- whether it's about ticket prices,
flight delays or lost bags.
</P>
<P>
US Airways pledged to make announcements every 15 to 20 minutes
on delays, cancellations and diversions, both at the gate and on
board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines, stung by an incident last January in which
passengers were stranded for hours in a plane on the runway in
Detroit during a snowstorm, said it would have "an event recovery
plan, which ensures Northwest passengers will not be held on-board
an aircraft for more than one hour in the event of an in-bound
flight delay."
</P>
<P>
The airlines' action toward soothing passengers followed
complaints prompted by a New Year's storm in the Midwest that left
thousands of travelers stranded in airports and on aircraft.
Congress threatened new legislation against the industry, which
was removed from federal control in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Buy Visio Corp for 1.3 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. said
Wednesday that it agreed to buy Visio Corp., a maker of technical
drawing software, for 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in stock.
</P>
<P>
The purchase will help Microsoft strengthen its grip on the
market for business productivity software, already dominated by
its Office suite of work processing, spreadsheet and presentation
products.
</P>
<P>
"There are very few areas Microsoft is not a player in. This is
one of them," said Frank Catalano, an industry analyst in Renton,
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Visio, founded in 1990, says its technical drawing software is
used by 3 million customers and posted 166 million U.S. dollars in
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Seattle-based Visio will become a division
within Microsoft's business productivity group, which includes the
Office suite of products, the software giant's biggest and most
profitable business line.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft senior vice president Bob Muglia said the company
planned to continue offering the recently released Visio 2000 line
of products as a "separate but complementary" addition to the
Office programs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they expected some of Visio's diagramming and
drawing programs to be eventually integrated into the Office suite.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft chose to acquire Visio rather than develop similar
software in-house because Visio has a well-known product with
loyal customers, said Microsoft senior vice president Bob Muglia.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is expected to close by mid-December at the
earliest, will add "very modestly" to Microsoft earnings
immediately and more over the long term as the business grows,
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei said.

<HEADLINE> EU Funding for Kenya's Coffee, Tea Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Kenya have signed a 135-million-shilling (some 1.8 million U.S.
dollars) financing pact in aid of Kenya's Coffee Research
Foundation to establish a tissue culture laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Martin Oduor-Otieno, Kenya's finance permanent secretary, and
Lutz Salzmann, head of the delegation of the European Commission,
signed the agreement here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also agreed to release the delayed
6.4-billion-shilling (about 84.7 million dollars) Stabex fund for
use by coffee and tea farmers in Kenya, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Salzmann said the total compensation for local farmers for loss
of earnings from coffee and tea during the 1990-1993 season was
estimated at 6. 4 billion shillings.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the delay in releasing the Stabex funds to
limitation on the part of implementing agencies, saying the
funding will also help develop infrastructure in agricultural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Salzmann cited that 100 million shillings will be allocated for
 electrification program for small factories and 700 million
shillings for rehabilitating roads.
</P>
<P>
Oduor-Otieno described the signed agreement as "an important
milestone towards the implementation of the projects which have
stagnated since 1990".
</P>
<P>
He urged the Coffee Research Foundation to popularize the
growing of better variety of coffee across the country in a bid to
increase the production.
</P>
<P>
According to Oduor-Otieno, the coffee production in Kenya
declined to 55, 042 tons in 1998 from 128,926 tons recorded in
1988.

Security Affairs Feisal Tanjung announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government deeply regrets Australia's attitude,
which has undermined bilateral relations with Indonesia as
indicated by its decision to stop military cooperation and
assistance, and to review cooperation in the security field,"
Feisal told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Based on the agreement, Indonesia and Australia will consult
about matters affecting their common security and develop
cooperation on security matters.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also contains provisions where the two countries
will consult each other in the case of adverse challenges to
either party, or to their common security interest, and, if
appropriate, consider measures which might be taken either
individually or jointly.
</P>
<P>
Australia suspended military cooperation with Indonesia last
week.
</P>
<P>
Director General for Political Affairs of the Foreign Ministry
Nugroho Wisnumurti said, "We don't intend to take further steps

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Say Universe to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli scientists said
they have discovered new evidence that proves the universe is
infinite and will expand forever.
</P>
<P>
The research by two Hebrew University cosmologists, Avishai
Dekel and Idit Zehavi, is published Thursday in the Nature science
magazine.
</P>
<P>
The pair's study is a continuation of research done in this
regard by U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
The scientific world has been divided for some time between
two conflicting schools of thought regarding the nature of the
universe. One claims that the universe is finite and, at some
stage, will cease to expand and begin to contract. The other
school believes that universe to be infinite and asserts that it
will never cease to expand.
</P>
<P>
Both schools are based on the works of Albert Einstein, who
initially believed that at some point gravitation ceases to draw
objects together, reversing itself and instead causing objects to
pull apart.
</P>
<P>
According to Einstein, this negative gravity causes the
universe's expansion to constantly gain momentum - hence the
theory that it will infinitely expand, since the greater the
distances the stronger negative gravity becomes.
</P>
<P>
Later in his life Einstein retracted his theory, calling it
"the biggest mistake of my life." But recent research by American
scientists proves that Einstein had it right the first time.
</P>
<P>
By measuring the expansion rate of supernovas, or exploding
stars, and comparing it to the expansion rate of supernovas that
exploded 4 million years ago, scientists came to the conclusion
that the expansion rate has increased, thus proving that the
universe's expansion is infinite.
</P>
<P>
Dekel said that while the evidence does prove that the universe
is infinite, it does not mean that its rate of expansion will
always increase.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that at some point, if the distances are great
enough, the forces will exactly balance each other out or even
cease to exist. If this is the case, the universe will continue
expanding, but at a uniform, unchanging rate," Dekel said.
</P>
<P>
Dekel and his team have taken their research one step further,
succeeding in mapping the density of what physicists call "dark
matter." The result show that the density of this material is
great enough to prove that gravity and antigravity do not cease
to exist, no matter how great the distance.

<HEADLINE> IOC to Offer Refund for Athletics Schedule Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee will pay for their decision to change the athletics
schedule for next year's Sydney Olympic Games by offering refund
for those ticket-buyers.
</P>
<P>
IOC will also underwrite the costs of any returned tickets that
were not re-sold, John Coates, vice-president of the organizing
committee SOCOG said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coates said that people, however, will not be allowed to swap
their tickets for other sessions in view of the heavy number of
applicants.
</P>
<P>
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch had said in Lausanne that
members of the public would be entitled to get their money back if
they bought seats to events that had been rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a gesture we have to make to show we are really
co-operating with the organizing committee in Sydney," he said.
</P>
<P>
IOC had rearranged 11 track and field finals for the 2000 Games
even though tickets for the events had already gone on sale,
Olympics minister Michael Knight announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The changes were made after the International Amateur Athletics
Federation asked for rest days between heats and finals for middle
and long distance races.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Employs More People in Central China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The figure shows that there are a total of 1.119 million urban
laborers in the province, 215,700 of whom are working for state-
owned enterprises and 258,200 for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
This increase is attributed to the structural reform in state-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The fact that more and more people have changed their thinking
away from the concept of the "iron rice bowl," a guaranteed state
job for life, is another reason for the surge.
</P>
<P>
The private economy in China has been growing very fast since
the country began opening to the outside world in 1978, and ever
more people have begun working in the private sector, as many
laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises joined private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce,
the number of private enterprises in China reached 1.28 million in
June this year, 80,000 more than at end of last year.

<HEADLINE> 17 Lebanese Pro-Israeli Militiamen Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Military Tribunal
Wednesday night gave 17 former pro-Israeli militiamen prison terms
ranging from two to 18 months for collaboration with Israel.
</P>
<P>
So far, 151 former members of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army (SLA) have stood trial since the militia withdrew in June
from the Jezzine area, a predominantly Christian town just outside
the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The convicts are among the 220 militiamen who voluntarily
surrendered to the authorities after the SLA withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Most of the militiamen put on trial have got light sentences
except three senior SLA officials, with two getting 15 years in
prison and a third receiving seven years.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-strong SLA, formed in 1985 when Israel set up a
security zone in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting
its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks, was
trained and armed by Israel to help patrol the occupied border
strip.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Vice-Chairman on Reunification of Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Jing Shuping, vice-chairman
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the greatest wish for people
of his generation is to witness the country's prosperity and
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Jing, who is in his 80s, said he hopes to see the reunification
of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits in his lifetime. "The
reunification of the motherland will be a high point for the whole
Chinese nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of the motherland is not only a major event
for the country, Jing said, it is also important to his family, as
his younger brother lives in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jing reunited with his brother in Hong Kong in the 1980s after
decades of separation.
</P>
<P>
Having led a delegation to Taiwan in 1996, Jing said the gap
between the people across the straits has been narrowed in terms
of people's living standards after 20 years' implementation of the
reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the "one country, two systems" policy is
reasonable for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said over 40,000 Taiwan companies have investment in inland
areas and the cross-straits import and export volume has reached
over 20 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The early realization of direct exchanges of mail delivery,
trade and air and shipping services will benefit people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits, he noted.

<P>
SHENYANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- "Shenyang, as one important
heavy industrial base in China, and the traffic hinge connecting
north and northeast China, is a large market of great potential,"
said Frank A. Ogden, executive vice president of General Motors
China Operations, at the recent Shenyang 99' Transnationals Forum.
</P>
<P>
GM entered the Chinese market in 1991 when they signed a
contract of cooperation with the Jinbei Auto Company.
</P>
<P>
Business was not as positive then as now, as the Chinese
partner had finance difficulties. However, they finally signed a
contract setting up a joint venture on June 22, 1998, with 230
million U.S. dollars, dividing the investment and the share in
half.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign investment environment has improved a lot in the
past few years," said Mr. Ogden who has witnessed great changes in
this field during his days in China. The GM Chevrolet is expected
to go into production in China in 2001, with output reaching 30,
000 vehicles for the first phase, and 50,000 in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
Many managers of multinational corporations share a similar
opinion when asked about their reasons for investing in northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence that high-quality tires will have good
sales in northeast China, " said Mr. Monteil, president of the
Michelin Shenyang Tire Co. Ltd. France's Michelin began its
investment in the city in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Along with this joint venture, Michelin has set up three others
in the past few years because of the Shenyang's improved
investment environment and great market potential.
</P>
<P>
The company now has invested a total of 120 million U.S.
dollars in the city, and its products have entered markets in
Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania, with tire exports
accounting for 80 percent of the output, and export value over 22
million U.S. dollars last year, said Mr. Monteil.

the 12th Century, health-conscious Tibetans are heading to a river
in southern Lhasa to splash about in the sun.
</P>
<P>
For the next month, men and women in Tibet's capital city can
be seen bathing joyfully in the river water, usually in the
afternoon when the water temperature is most enjoyable. Like their
ancestors 800 years ago, they believe that the river water in
Autumn has the power to prevent a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
Many bathers have set up tents on the site and brought
alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
Some local people have tried to profit from the tradition. A
local park in Lhasa, which used to open free of charge for the
event, now sells tickets.
</P>
<P>
Quzhen, a woman who owns a drugstore at the riverside, said
business has been brisk. "Towels, beer and soft drinks are
bestsellers," she said.
</P>
<P>
While they do have fun with a good custom, Tibetans have never
denied modern life. Public and private bathing facilities and even
saunas have appeared in Tibetan-populated areas.

<HEADLINE> China's SEZs Striving to Stay Special(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year
marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China. China's economic successes over the past five
decades has attracted the attention of the world. Xinhua began
issuing stories on the country's economy on August 17. This is the
24th.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, a small town in south China two decades ago with 310,
000 rural residents, has now grown into a modern city of 3.5
million people. The explanation for this miracle is attributed to
its good luck in having been chosen as the country's first special
economic zone (SEZ).
</P>
<P>
The central government approved the establishment of the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in August 1980. Not long after,
China set up three more SEZs in the coastal cities of Zhuhai,
Shantou, and Xiamen. And in 1988, China established its fifth SEZ
on the island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
During the process of China's reform and opening, these zones
have served as "experimental areas." Shenzhen, for example, has
pioneered more than 200 important aspects of the reform program,
including price reform, ownership transfer of enterprises, and
housing reform.
</P>
<P>
The central government now is pushing ahead with a port
management system reform experiment in Shenzhen, as it attempts to
open the service sector and foreign trade wider to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
"SEZs can try reform measures that cannot be tried in the
inland areas, a sign that SEZs are still something special," said
Li Haiyan, a State Council official.
</P>
<P>
In addition to geographical advantages, central to the success
of SEZs are the flexible and preferential policies granted to them
by the central government, such as helping the zones accumulate
their development funds and providing long-term bank loans at low
interest rates, Li said.

ABU DHABI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East Optical and
Ophthalmic Exhibition, to be held in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates, from February 10 to 13, 2000, is drawing participants
from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors from the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Austria,
Italy, China, Britain, Singapore and other countries will be
taking part in the biennial event which has been recognized by
the optical industry as its most significant showcase in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will feature the latest in eyewear, eye care,
optical aids and accessories and cater to a fast-growing demand
for optical products in the Middle East, according to the Khaleej
Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 edition of the exhibition drew more than 125 companies
from 24 countries with business worth 5 million U.S. dollars
concluded.

<P>
As a matter of fact, their not being special demonstrates the
fundamental experimental nature of the zones, and shows that the
experience of the zones has spread to and influenced other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1990s, the SEZs began to restructure their
industries, and now they have largely relocated their old labor-
intensive operations and created technology- and capital-intensive
enterprises in their place.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, for example, garment and textile manufacturers
have been shifted to inland sites, while hi-tech industries
devoted to the production of computers, telecom, bioengineering,
and the like, are developing rapidly, rising by 60 percent
annually in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year the output value of Shenzhen's
hi-tech sector topped 65.5 billion yuan, nearly 40 percent of the
city's total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Similar restructuring has taken place in the other four zones,
as have impressive economic growth rates. Last year, the gross
domestic product (GDP) of the five zones reached 284.3 billion
yuan, more than 100 times that of 20 years ago. And in 1998 their
imports and exports registered 65.8 billion U.S. dollars, 20
percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
"Once again our SEZs are showing the way -- this time with
restructuring -- and setting an example for the entire nation's
economic development," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Denies Alleged Bombing of Civilian Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
Thursday denied alleged bombing of civilian targets as fighting
between government troops and Tamil rebels escalated in the
country's north.
</P>
<P>
The air force on Wednesday conducted two missions successfully
against selected Tamil rebels' camps, military spokesman Brigadier
Sunil Tennakoon said.
</P>
<P>
He told a weekly press briefing that the government forces
would never bomb civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) alleged
in a statement that 22 civilians were killed and another 41
wounded in an air raid on the village of Puthukkudirruppu in
Mullaitivu district, some 290 kilometers northeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed the
attack, adding that reports so far from its officials in the
region said 21 civilians had been killed.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said in the statement that government jets attacked as
the refugees were shopping at a village market.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after fierce battles between the government
troops and the rebels killed at least 169 combatants over the
weekend in the northern Wanni region.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983. Over 55,000 have
been reported to be killed in the ethnic conflicts.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The consumer price index rose by 0.5 percent last month,
meaning that inflation has risen 0.4 percent so far this year, the
lowest figure for the first eight months of any year since 1967.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time in 1999 that the inflation total is
above zero. Despite the low inflation rate thus far in 1999,
experts expect the final figure to hover around 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's army Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz said in an
interview with Ha'aretz that Israel and the Palestinians are not
likely to meet Prime Minister Ehud Barak's goal of reaching a
final-status agreement in one year.
</P>
<P>
He warned that "a fifty-year conflict cannot be resolved within
a year or two," saying that the major problems are still ahead of
both sides. "So the time frame is the big question."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The health of Syrian President Hafez Assad is
deteriorating. Western diplomats meeting him recently said he was
disoriented in talks and could not complete his thoughts and
sentences clearly.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is obstructing the
police investigation over charges that he and his wife, Sara,
received bribes and misused public funds during his three-year
term of office.
</P>
<P>
He and Sara were questioned separately by police for more than
eight hours Wednesday and will possibly be summoned for
questioning again.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Denounces U.S. Double-dealing Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry
spokesman from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on
Wednesday denounced the U.S. for its double-dealing tactics,
saying this only deepens Pyongyang's mistrust of, and heightens
its vigilance against, Washington.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is clinging to double-dealing tactics by saying one
thing at negotiations with the DPRK and another behind the scene,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"As we have already clarified more than once, when the U.S.
shows good faith, we will reciprocate it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and South Korea held a "tripartite
summit meeting" on September 12 before the opening of the APEC
meeting, at which they issued a "joint press statement."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that in the statement, the United States
talks nonsense by suggesting that a comprehensive, joint and
integral stand by the U.S., Japan and South Korea would provide a
precious opportunity of ensuring peace and security on the Korean
Peninsula and that the three are ready to take all measures to
improve relations with the DPRK according to the step it takes for
detente and durable peace.
</P>
<P>
The United States produced such a statement at the time when
high-level negotiations are underway over the pending issues
between the DPRK and the U.S. It is an ill-intentioned attempt to
avail itself of an international meeting which can easily draw
world attention to force the DPRK feel a "sense of psychological
oppression" once again and wrest a sort of concession from it, the
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States is truly interested in peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula, it should fundamentally rectify
its policy to stifle the DPRK, withdraw from South Korea its
forces, which is the main stumbling block in the way of peace and
security on the peninsula, and root out all threats to the DPRK,
including joint military exercises, before urging the DPRK to show
an affirmative response," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Flower Production, Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Famous for its orchids and
other tropical flowers, Thailand is aiming to become a flower
production center by increasing the number of commercial
nurseries, The Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Agriculture and Cooperative
Ministry is planning to increase commercial flower nurseries by 10
percent to 50,000 rai (8,000 hectares) within two years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also making efforts to improve the quality of
locally-grown flowers to substitute for imports from Malaysia and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The ministry expects the imports of foreign-grown flowers, such
as roses, chrysanthemums and gerberas, could be reduced by 10
percent by developing local substitutes.
</P>
<P>
Annual production of flowers in Thailand was expected to rise
to 71,741 tons from 64,570 tons by 2001. The ministry aims to
export 15,571 tons in 2001, up from 11,699 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The baht's devaluation during the financial crisis has been a
help to make Thai flowers more competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Under the ministry's plan, a flower export zone and central
market will be established. Participating growers and exporters
will be registered and required to meet high quality standards.
</P>
<P>
Seed development will be stepped up and nurseries will be
encouraged to try new varieties. Nurseries will be urged to use
new technology and the best growing techniques.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a database on production and marketing to
provide the ministry with information it needs.

<HEADLINE> Wild Ants Become Arthritis Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The first medicine in the
world made from wild ants to treat rheumatoid arthritis has been
licensed by China's State Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
The medicine, developed by Wu Zhicheng, a doctor at the Jinling
Geriatric Hospital in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu
Province, is now in trial production at Nanjing's Zhongshan
Pharmaceutical Factory.
</P>
<P>
China has a long history of using ants as medicine. Ben Cao
Gang Mu or Compendium of Materia Medica, the best-known and
respected Chinese medical manual written by Li Shizhen in the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), includes a detailed description of the
medicinal properties of wild ants.
</P>
<P>
Wu began his pharmacological research on wild ants in the early
1980s. His studies show that wild ants are rich in various types
of protein, amino acids and minerals, and are able to reduce
inflammation and ease pain.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 clinical tests conducted at six hospitals in
Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing indicate that the new wild ant-based
capsule has proven effective on 81.7 percent of the test cases, a
better result than that of other medicines.
</P>
<P>
Doctors don't know the cause of rheumatoid arthritis, a
progressive disease characterized by inflammation and swelling of
the joints.

<P>
KUNMING, September 16 (Xinhua) --The number of visitors to the
ongoing World Horticulture Exposition in Kunming, the provincial
capital of Yunnan Province in southwest China, is on the decline,
tourism officials here say.
</P>
<P>
In July and August, the number of visitors peaked at an average
50,000-plus per day and on July 24 reached a record high of 81,100.
In recent weeks, however, the tally has dropped to a low daily
average of 22,000.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials say that the ticket sales have dropped at
least partly because Chinese kids and college students have
returned to school.
</P>
<P>
The international horticulture show, in which the Chinese
Government alone invested as much as 1.6 billion yuan, has
attracted numerous domestic and overseas people with its floral
gardens built by different countries, large greenhouses, and a man-
made Nature Hall.
</P>
<P>
The event is the source of huge tourism income for the province,
especially the provincial capital, where all hotels and
restaurants are usually full during the run.

This demonstration project, the largest of its kind in China,
was created by the Beijing Solar Energy Lab, and replaces
conventional fuels with solar energy to help protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Compared with conventional compression air-conditioners, the
project can save about 60 percent in electricity use per year,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
The project has a large solar receiver which operates over an
area of 540 square meters and can provide 100 kilowatts of heating
or cooling capacity. In spring and autumn, the system can also
provide 30 tons of hot water for households daily.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exporters Benefit From Strong Yen, Weak Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters are reaping a
double windfall from the baht's weakness and the yen's surge
against the U.S. dollar, The Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen reached 103.36 per dollar Wednesday, its
highest level for three and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Masatsugu Nagato, general manager of Industrial Bank of Japan
in Bangkok, was quoted as saying that a stronger yen means
Japanese exporters would lose their competitiveness and that is
good for exporters of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The stronger Japanese currency also reflects clear signs of
economic recovery, pointing to the fact that Japan can buy more
goods from Thailand, where export income contributes around 40 to
45 percent of the total gross domestic product growth, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Local exporters were also benefiting from the weakness of the
baht, which had dived to a new 11-month low of 39.75 baht against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Nagato said local importers could be hurt a little. However,
the economic crisis still discourages imports and investment in
Thailand and thus the potential degree of difficulty for them is
only slight.

BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Commodities
Futures Exchange of Thailand (ACFET) plans to open by March or May
next year with four important goods -- rice, shrimp, tapioca and
rubber, The Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commerce Minister Phaitoon Kaewthong said after chairing
the committee on the futures market establishment that the draft
Futures Market Act is in the process of being published in the
Royal Gazette. The act will take effect within six months after
publication.
</P>
<P>
The committee also approved the setting up of a subcommittee to
draw up regulations, contract forms, documents, minimum and
maximum trading volumes and a transaction system.
</P>
<P>
The committee will ask the experts from the Stock Exchange of
Thailand to help set up all necessary systems such as computers to
complete transactions in the initial stages.
</P>
<P>
Phaitoon said the electronic system is likely to be selected
because it is more transparent than traditional brokering.
</P>
<P>
ACFET aims to stabilize commodity prices and reduce funds spent
on government intervention programs every year. In addition, it
will also generate higher incomes for farmers.

<HEADLINE> Another Apartment Building Blown up in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Another apartment building in
Russia was blown up early Thursday, this time in the southern city
of Volgodonsk, killing four people and injuring over 70, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The blast happened at 05:50 Moscow time (0150 GMT), and
demolished a nine-story building made of prefabricated panels,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how many people were inside the building, but
the death toll is expected to rise in the explosion that was said
to be caused by a bomb inside a GAZ-53 truck parked near the
building in 35 Gagarin Street.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth explosion that rocked Russia since August 31,
when a bomb went off in an underground shopping mall near the
Kremlin, killing one person and injuring dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, a car bomb destroyed a residential block inside
a military compound in Buinaksk, Daghestan, killing 64 people,
many of them women and children.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people were killed in two subsequent explosions
in the capital city on September 8 and 12.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe terrorists with links to Chechen rebels
were behind the blasts and security has been beefed up in Moscow
and around the country, especially near vital installations.

<HEADLINE> Thai Electronic Assemblers Turn to Local Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- More electronic assemblers in
Thailand turned to locally-made components, saving the country at
least 1 billion baht (26.3 million U.S. dollars) a year, The
Bangkok Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The trend was promoted by the Board of Investment (BOI), which
launched a Unit for Industrial Linkage Development (BUILD)
project.
</P>
<P>
Established in November 1997, BUILD served as a link between
buyers and manufacturers of industrial products. It now has about
500 small and medium-sized enterprises as members.
</P>
<P>
BOI officials said that as more electronic assemblers were
joining the project, the country might save up to 1.5 billion baht
(39.4 million dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure was still small when compared with the
whole industry. Each year, Thailand exports electronic products
worth about 600 billion baht (15.8 billion dollars) while
importing parts for about 500 billion baht (13.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
BOI officials urged more buyers and suppliers to join the BUILD
project so as to promote the development of local electronic
components manufacturing industry and save the country more
foreign reserves.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Author of China's Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Before Huang Jiren, no
Chinese writer had ever tackled the story of the life of POWs in
China's 1945-1949 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Huang has been writing about the POWs' since 1977, when he was
still in college.
</P>
<P>
His first book, "The War Not Only On the Battlefield," tells
the tale of how the Kuomintang (KMT) officers and men who
surrendered in the war were re-educated by the central government
and until they were no longer enemies of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The civil war ended in 1949 with KMT's retreat to Taiwan.
However, many KMT members did not follow their colleagues, but
remained and surrendered to the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Based on its consistent principle of giving preferential
treatment to POWs, the CPC showed them the true nature of KMT's
leader Chiang Kai-shek and the truth of socialism in order to turn
enemies into friends, instead of putting them in prison.
</P>
<P>
The book reflects this history and created a great public buzz.
</P>
<P>
His contemporaries called him the "author of the civil war" who
explored a new field in culture. His books "Collapse" and "
Chongqing Negotiation" have been made into films that were
nationally acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Huang attributes his success to his unique experiences. His
father was a high-ranking officer in the KMT army. In Huang's
first book he interviews his father, along with some 100 famous
former KMT military officers, including Du Yuming and Huang Wei,
who had similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
In the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Huang
was persecuted because of his relationship with the KMT. So was
his father, who died in prison.
</P>
<P>
Huang then had to carry sand along the Yangtze River to make a
living. Then he spent eight years in an outlying rural area of
Sichuan province, doing farm work and living with local farmers
until the national college entrance examination was resumed by the
government in 1977s. Huang took it and entered Neijiang Normal
College.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee
which convened in late 1978 was a turnaround in Huang's life. No
one would look down upon him any more because of who he was or had
been.
</P>
<P>
To date, he has written eight books which have established his
reputation. He has been elected to be a deputy to the National
People's Congress (NPC) and to a member of the National Committee
of the Ninth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (
CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Huang has recorded the development of China's democratic
construction in his book "A NPC Deputy's Diary," including the
details of the discussion on the proposals for the Three Gorges
Project and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
He said his new book about the NPC system and the construction
of democratic and legal system will be issued on October 1, as a
gift for the 50th birthday of the People's Republic of China.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The "two states" statement
made by Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, which runs counter to the
historical trend, goes nowhere in the international arena and Lee'

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi here today.

has again refused the proposal raised by a small number of
countries to list the issue of Taiwan's "representation" in the
United Nations on the agenda of the session.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the fact has fully demonstrated the firm stand of
most UN member nations to safeguard the purpose and principles of
the UN Charter, maintain the UN Resolution 2758 and adhere to the
"one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Facts have again indicated that the attempt of the Taiwan
authorities to create "two Chinas" and "one China, One Taiwan" in
the United Nations is "futile and unpopular", the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Exit Poll Sees BJP Ahead in India's Lok Sabha Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Exit polls conducted by
media organization Doordarshan on the first two phases of the Lok
Sabha elections, released Thursday, projected a comfortable lead
for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
</P>
<P>
Of the 268 parliamentary seats for which voting has been
completed, the BJP and its allies were set to win 145 seats, a
gain of 28 from last Lok Sabha polls and the Congress party and
its allies were likely to take 105, only two fewer than last time.
</P>
<P>
In the 545-seat Lok Sabha, the coalition led by BJP would
require a majority of 272 seats to form a government.
</P>
<P>
The polls suggested that the biggest losers in the first phases
of the elections were smaller parties which are not part of the
rainbow coalition put together by the BJP and do not come under
the Congress umbrella.
</P>
<P>
The NDA tally has gone up with the BJP strength rising
significantly in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana. BJP and
allies gained as many as 19 seats in Maharashtra, six in Rajasthan
and five in Haryana.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Election Commission withdrew its controversial
guidelines banning the publication and telecast of opinion and
exit polls during the election following the Supreme Court ruling
that the commission had no power to issue such an order.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Paraguayan General Warned Not to Perform Political Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
Wednesday warned exiled Paraguayan ex-general Lino Oviedo not to
plan or participate in political activities within the country.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Carlos Corach said that Argentina would
defend his right to asylum, but that it was also "inflexible" in
its decision to not permit Oviedo to participate in political
activities within the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition alliance, Oviedo held a political
meeting last Saturday in Argentina, which was attended by dozens
of his followers.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government's warning to Oviedo was made in
response to the political opposition's appeal to the Supreme
Court to have Argentina's denial of Paraguay's right of
extradition in the Oviedo case declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo came to Argentina for asylum on March 29. He was accused
of instigating the assassination of Paraguayan Vice-President Luis
Maria Argana on March 23. For that reason the Paraguayan justice
system has requested his extradition.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia May Not Compete in Sydney Olympic Tennis, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian men's and women's
tennis single players had a slim chance of competing at next year'
s Olympic Games in Sydney, due to the poor training system in
place.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti) Tanri
Abeng said that Indonesian tennis players might be ready for the
2004 Olympics, because the country needed time and enough funds to
develop talented players who could follow the achievements of
legendary player Yayuk Basuki.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk played at the last three Olympics, in 1988, 1992 and 1996,
but did not make it to the finals. Only single's players with a
world ranking of between 1 to 48 automatically qualify for next
year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Don't think that the Olympics is everything. We are just
starting to groom young players to produce national players like
Yayuk. We are relatively late for this. We have to be realistic.
We can't produce top players who can compete in the Olympics in
just one year," Tanri was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to send our players to the world event, it means
that we have weaknesses in our training system. This fact should
have stimulated us to improve our training, particularly for the
12 to 15-year-old players," said Tanri, who is also state minister
of the empowerment of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said a shortage of funds, resulting from the monetary
crisis, was another constraint in the training program.
</P>
<P>
"Before the crisis, we could send four players away for
overseas training, but now, our budget only allow us to send one
player annually," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanri however said the men's and women's double players still
had a chance to qualify for the quadrennial event if they won
their divisions at next year's Asian tennis championship.
</P>
<P>
"Don't expect too much from our players. Our women's doubles
will face tough competition from Japan and Thailand, and our men's
doubles, from Thailand. We have to admit our weaknesses so that
we are motivated to work harder," Tanri said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, Pelti would invite foreign coaches to
exchange experiences with Indonesian coaches and to train the
national team players.
</P>
<P>
Pelti had increased the number of local tournaments attended by
international players, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Reviews Surfing Law as Rainstorm Approaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
reviewing a law banning surfing at beaches ordered closed during a
typhoon, the English-language newspaper Hong Kong Standard
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move came as the No. 10 Typhoon Signal was hoisted early
Thursday as severe tropical Typhoon York was moving closer to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
At present, surf offenders face a maximum fine of 2,000 HK
dollars (256 U.S. dollars) and 14 days' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
But the Urban Services Department said the law has never been
executed, because it was hard to implement.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite impossible to block off an entire beach, and life
guards cannot stay on the beaches round the clock," the paper
quoted Paul Cheung Kwok-yee, the department's senior staff officer,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people had to be rescued off Hong Kong beaches
when Typhoon Sam struck Hong Kong last month.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seen as Vegetable Seed Hub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is likely to become
a leader in seed production, especially of vegetables, the
newspaper Bangkok Post said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is well-placed because it produces high-quality seeds
for the local and export markets, Anthony Tse, president of the
Asia and Pacific Seed Association (APSA), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tse is in Thailand this week to attend the Sixth Asian Seed
Conference in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Thai private sector is very active in seed production and
Thai farmers accept the cultivation of hybrid varieties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, Thailand is moving to
be a leader in tropical Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
The development of the seed industry in Asia will come at a
faster pace with the assistance of new technology, which will
speed up the process by offering a better selection of genes, Tse
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Manas Chiaravanond, executive vice-president of Chia
Tai Co. Ltd., who received the APSA Special Award this week, said
Thailand is a leading global production base for vegetable seeds.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has done very well in the production of watermelon,
cucumber, pepper, tomato, pumpkin and squash seeds, according to
Manas.
</P>
<P>
Thai farmers are well-recognized internationally in the
production of vegetable seeds for hand-pollinated crops, he noted.

<P>
BELGRADE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A floating bridge over the
Danube in Novi Sad has been constructed and was opened to traffic
Wednesday, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, which is 390 meters long and nine meters wide, has
two lanes and two walkways.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the Beska Bridge, another bridge spanning
the Danube in the city, was finished on July 20, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In the opening ceremony, Dragan Tomic, president of the
assembly of the Serb Republic of Yugoslavia, said "the Federation
of Yugoslavia has become the largest construction site in Europe."
The country is in the process of being reconstructed as a result
of the war.
</P>
<P>
The three bridges over the Danube in Novi Sad in northern
Yugoslavia were destroyed during NATO's 79-day bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia, which began on March 24.

<HEADLINE> East Asian Tourists Flock to Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- There has been a sharp
increase in tourist arrivals from East Asian countries to Sri
Lanka following the gradual recovery of the Asian financial
situation, tourist officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They said the increase in tourist arrivals also could be
attributed to promotional activities to build a positive image for
the tropical island nation during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
From January to July this year 27,708 tourists from East Asia
visited Sri Lanka, registering an increase of 39.1 percent over
the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Japan topped the arrival list of
East Asia with a total of 9,519 tourists arrivals recording a
49.3-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Malaysia recorded a 66.3-percent rise to 3,168,
while the number of tourists from Singapore went up by 39.7
percent to 3,873.
</P>
<P>
Increases were also recorded in tourist traffic from Thailand
(42.6 percent) and South Korea (34 percent).
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of this year a total of 246,054
tourists visited Sri Lanka, recording an increase of 21.4 percent
over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year Sri Lanka earned about 14.8 billion rupees (224
million U.S. dollars) from 381,063 tourists. The tourism sector
has become one of the major foreign exchange earners for the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Tourist Board has predicted a 17-percent rise in tourist
arrivals this year to around 446,000.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Kazakhstan Sign 7 Bilateral Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- During Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to Bulgaria, the two countries signed
on Wednesday seven bilateral agreements, including a presidential
declaration, on promoting bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov and his
Kazakh counterpart voiced their will to further promote
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The document stressed the strategic importance of the
implementation of the Interstate Oil and Gas Transport to Europe
Program and the "new silk road project," which will make the
European and Asian transcontinental transport networks accessible
to Central Asian and Caucasus countries.
</P>
<P>
The other six agreements included four inter-governmental
accords on mutual promotion and protection of investments,
cooperation in tourism, standardization, meteorology,
certification and aviation.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two were inter-departmental accords on
cooperation in education and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference, the Bulgarian President said that
there are untapped opportunities for promoting commercial,
economic and cultural relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov in particular cited the silk road restoration as a
major long-term project that would involve not only the
establishment of a transport corridor but also possibilities for
oil and gas shipment.
</P>
<P>
He also viewed the promotion of trade and joint ventures as
short-term tasks.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, commodity exchanges between the two countries were
worth only 22.5 million US dollars, unsatisfactory to both sides.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kazakh President Nazarbayev described as being of
bilateral interest the implementation of the silk road project,
which would involve transport arteries and oil pipelines through
the Caspian to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
Although Kazakhstan is rich in oil and gas resources, its
annual oil output is only at 26 million tons for lack of export
possibilities, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan hopes to boost its oil exports to 120 million tons
in 2007 and 230 million tons in 2012, and will need a transport
corridor through Bulgaria, he added.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures on China's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: The People's Republic of China celebrates its
50th founding anniversary this year and Xinhua will release 10
stories on key facts and figures on the nation's economic and
social development over the last half century. This is the second.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- In the 50 years since the
founding of new China, China has developed from one of the poorest
countries in the world into a major power in international trade,
as indicated by the following facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's 11th largest trade power in 1998, compared
to the 32nd in 1978.
</P>
<P>
It exported 183.8 billion U.S. dollars-worth of products in
1998, which is 80 times more than that of 1959, and 18 times over
1978.
</P>
<P>
It imported 140.2 billion dollars-worth of products in 1998,
which is 242 times the figure for 1950 and 13 times over 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China exported 163.2 billion dollars worth of
manufactured goods, or 89 percent of its total export value.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and electronic products were leaders in China's
export products for the fourth consecutive year in 1998. The
export of these products was worth 66.5 billion dollars in 1998,
accounting for 36 percent of China's total export value.
</P>
<P>
China had more than 60 trade partners during the 1950s. The
number of China's trade partners increased to 180 in 1980 and is
now at 227.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China's top 10 export markets were: Hong Kong, the
United States, Japan, Germany, the Republic of Korea (ROK), the
Netherlands, Britain, Singapore, Taiwan and France.
</P>
<P>
Its top 10 import source countries and regions in 1998 were:
Japan, the United States, Taiwan, ROK, Germany, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Russia, France and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Processing trade is now the most important foreign trade form
for China. Its value in 1998 was 173 billion US dollars, making up
53 percent of the country's total foreign trade value.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, foreign trade accounted for 10 percent of China's
gross domestic product (GDP). The figure rose to 34 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign reserve stood at 145 billion US dollars in 1998,
compared to 840 million dollars in 1979.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 23,000 enterprises engaged in export
and import business.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Cataracts Still Top Cause of China's Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent sample survey
conducted by Chinese ophthalmologists shows that cataracts are the
leading cause of blindness for 41.6 percent of Chinese blind
people.
</P>
<P>
The survey's findings were announced at the ongoing Asian-
Pacific contract operation conference here, which has drawn some
300 experts from more than 30 countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) standards, shows that more than five million Chinese people
suffer from cataracts, or 0.46 percent of China's population.
</P>
<P>
Blind and sight-impaired people make up 0.43 percent and 0.58
of China's population. Among this group, 49.38 percent of the
sight-impaired have cataracts and 73.13 percent of the blind and
sight-impaired people over 60 suffer from cataracts.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that the cataract incidence in lower-
latitude areas in south China and the plateau regions is much
higher than in the north. For instance, the cataract incidence in
south China's Guangdong province and in Tibet Autonomous Region
are 0.69 percent and 1.04 percent, while in northeast China's
Heilongjiang the figure is merely 0.26 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, people who live in high altitudes
which have more hours of sunshine are more prone to cataracts.

The Times of India:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Wednesday asked
Congress President Sonia Gandhi to come forward with "a proper

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Semiconductor Equipment Industry Benefits from Foundry Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan now accounts for
two-thirds of revenue's worldwide for foundry-produced integrated
circuits, according to data released Wednesday by a global trade
association.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's share of the worldwide semiconductor equipment market
has burgeoned from one percent in 1990 to a projected 18 percent
by the end of 1999, surpassing South Korea and Europe, and nearly
catching up with Japan, which accounts for 21 percent, according
to data from the California-based Semiconductor Equipment and
Materials International (SEMI
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor equipment capital spending in Taiwan has
increased from 80 million U.S. dollars in 1990 to 3.28 billion
dollars in 1998, and is projected to reach 4.2 billion dollars
this year and 5.2 billion dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Foundries represent 25 to 30 percent of world chip production.
A foundry is a semiconductor manufacturer that makes chips for a
third party, while a "fabless," or fabricationless, refers to a
semiconductor vendor that does not have in-house manufacturing
facilities but does design and test chips.
</P>
<P>
Now nearly every fabless integrated circuit design house and
integrated device manufacturer has part or all of its products
made at a foundry based in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The foundry business model, and its corresponding emerging
customer model, the fabless company, emerged in the early-to-mid
1980s. The emergence of the foundry industry is a structural
response to the need to concentrate capital.

<HEADLINE> New Pit Found Near First Emperor's Tomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists recently
discovered a new pit at Qin Shihuang's Tomb -- the world-famous
burial grounds of China's first emperor which have been dubbed the
"eighth wonder of the world."
</P>
<P>
The 13,000-square-meter apparently subordinate pit lies in the
southeast of the burial grounds. Its square shape is similar to
that of the two large pits which were found earlier and contain
the renowned life-sized terra cotta warriors and horses.
</P>
<P>
In the new and third pit, archaeologists found 80 stone suits
of armor and 30 stone helmets. All of the armor and helmets are
made of dark blue stone plate of the same thickness. Pieces are
attached with copper strips.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese expert has called the discovery "an unprecedented
event in the archaeological history of both China and abroad."
</P>
<P>
"Such perfect craftsmanship has never been recorded in any
historical documents. Discovery of these objects has filled a gap
in our understanding of Chinese military equipment from ancient
times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin Shihuang forced 800,000 workers to build the tomb for him
when he was only 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
The "most splendid archeological find" in this century was
accidentally discovered in 1974 by a local farmer while he was
digging a well. Since then, three huge pits have been discovered
near the tomb.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 2,200-year-old life-sized terra cotta warriors
and horses along with tens of thousands of pieces of weaponry have
been uncovered from the three pits. The purpose of the warriors
and horses, located less than a mile from the emperor's tomb, was
to maintain and protect the spirit of their ruler throughout
eternity.

CHONGQING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality in
southwest China is using foreign funds to shore up its
afforestation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 hectares of forests have been added to the city in
recent years, mainly along the Yangtze River where the Three
Gorges Hydro-electric Power Project is under construction.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, an inland industrial heartland, became China's
fourth municipality directly under central government jurisdiction
in 1997, joining the ranks of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the World Bank has financed the city's tree-
planting programs, with about 200 million yuan (about 24.1 million
U.S. dollars) in loans. This year, the German government has begun
to provide some 12 million DM in funds to the city government for
a major afforestation program in the Three Gorges Dam area.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing section of the Yangtze is one of the most eroded
areas in China.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Exports 230,000 Cubic Meters of Teak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 233,616 cubic
meters of teak in fiscal 1998-99 which ended in March, 19.63
percent more than the previous fiscal year when 195,270 cubic
meters were exported.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, the foreign exchange earnings
through the export amounted to 141 million U.S. dollars in
1998-99, 21.55 percent more than that obtained in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year, Myanmar also exported 358,419 cubic
meters of hardwood, earning 34.98 million dollars. The export
quantity and foreign exchange earnings respectively increased by
64.58 percent and 36.37 percent compared with the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The figures of the Myanmar Ministry of Forestry indicate that
the country's forest area is reducing year by year. The percentage
of coverage by forest in the country dropped to 50 percent at the
end of 1998, falling by 7 percent compared with 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The cause of forest depletion was attributed to indiscriminate
felling and cutting of trees including firewood plantations for
fuel and burning of charcoal.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out projects for greening the arid districts
under which revival of firewood plantations is among measures
taken.
</P>
<P>
The country also introduced firewood substitute fuel such as
briquette, micro-wave ovens and agricultural wastes in its effort
to prevent forest depletion and preserve the nation's forest and
environment.

 was among the measures taken to ensure that agriculture, the
mainstay of the country's economy, is not effected.
</P>
<P>
Other measures cover raising the customs duties of luxury goods
imported and levying an 8-percent commercial tax on foreign
currencies beginning January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> China in Top Gear to Clean up Major Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China has started the countdown
to clean up one of its major lakes, Chaohu, in eastern Anhui
Province by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pollutant plants have been ordered to shut down without delay
or face harsh penalties imposed by the State Environmental
Protection Administration, China's watchdog on ecology and
environment.
</P>
<P>
Clearing Chaohu lake is one of the nation's largest
environmental protection projects this century, which is expected
to cost millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China launched an ambitious program in 1997 to rein in
pollution in and around three rivers and two lakes -- Huaihe,
Haihe, Liaohe, Dianchi, and Chaohu.
</P>
<P>
The target at Chaohu is to make all industrial enterprises
around the freshwater lake reach the State-set pollutant discharge
standard by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's largest freshwater lakes, Chaohu seats on a
major migration route between Australia and China for many wading
birds and is a winter home for 200 species of migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the lake has been threatened by pollution and
dwindling wetlands areas. Migratory birds are seldom seen hovering
and few fishermen can be spotted in the lake, which is filled with
withering reeds.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 280 million tons of industrial sewage and that
created by nearby residents flows into the lake every year, and a
13,000-kilometer area around the lake suffers from serious soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
Some 9.6 million people are affected by the deteriorating
environment, and many are becoming more involved in protecting
their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at a chemical plant located by the lake are
developing a large variety of phosphorus-free detergents and
washing powder. They said it exceeded their expectations that the
plant's new products were sold out as soon as they hit the stores.

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Issues More Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of
China (Eximbank) successfully issued three billion yuan (361
million US dollars) worth of two-year financial bonds Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the Eximbank has obtained
approval of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, and its
second market-adjusted issuance of policy financial bonds follows
a similar five billion yuan floatation on May 6, this year.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank is one of the three Chinese policy banks, which is
specialized in supporting mechanical and electronic exports.
</P>
<P>
The offering followed the practice of public bidding that the
bank is pursuing for more effective management.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate is set at an annual 2.91 percent as a result
of heated bidding, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
About 29 financial institutions participated in the bidding
before 20 of them won out and became the underwriters of the three
billion yuan batch.
</P>
<P>
Underwriting offers from the bidders totaled 7.27 billion yuan,
more than double the amount offered by the Eximbank.

<HEADLINE> Hebei To Be Another Center for Chinese Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province has long
tried to attract more overseas investment while at the same time
expanding its export business on other continents, a top
provincial official said recently.
</P>
<P>
Ye Liansong, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said that the province has garnered a
total 9.06 billion U.S. dollars, and set up 4,521 solely foreign-
funded enterprises, joint ventures, and cooperative firms, with
the overseas financing used accounting for over 11 percent of the
province's fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua reporters, Ye said that most joint
ventures are engaged in the six export-oriented pillar industries,
including textile and clothing, machinery and electronics,
pharmaceuticals and chemistry, building materials, light industry,
and high-quality agricultural and sideline products.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the markets in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, as
well as in Japan and countries in Southeast Asia, it is also
trying to get its exports into the markets in Europe, Central and
Latin America, Africa, and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, Hebei has in the last two decades spent a
significant sum to build up its infrastructure, particularly
transport, telecommunications, electricity, and water-control
facilities, said Ye.
</P>
<P>
And it has issued preferential policies and set up an
administrative center to offer services to foreign-funded
enterprises and to ensure the legal rights of overseas businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Ye said Hebei is encouraging overseas investment in the fields
of agriculture, energy resources, telecommunications, energy-
saving and technological upgrading projects, which will benefit
both the province and the country. A high proportion of hi-
technology is crucial for rapid growth of the provincial economy,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The province is located in the central area of the Bohai Bay
surrounding Beijing and Tianjin, a port city in north China, with
a coastline of 487 kilometers. Officials there are striving to
make the Bohai Bay area another vital contributor to the Chinese
economy after the Pearl River Delta area and the Yangtze River
Delta area, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Cooperate With Multinational Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
military said they had accepted the U.N. Security Council decision
to send an Australia-led multinational force to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie welcomed Australia's role,
Minister of Information Muhammad Yunus said after a cabinet
meeting here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia never has any hostile feeling against any other
countries," Yunus said, adding that Indonesian Military (TNI)
members will act as liaison officers and observers in the force.
</P>
<P>
TNI spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudrajat said Wednesday that the
military was not in any position to reject the U.N. decision.
</P>
<P>
"We will be very cooperative. TNI is prepared to join the
multinational force if asked. But if it is not needed, we will
only be too happy to stay out," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the role of Australia in the force, Sudrajat
said: "People should understand that there have been bitter
feelings between people in the two countries. Political leaders in
Indonesia and Australia should understand the situation, and this
should not jeopardize our bilateral relationship that has been
going on very well, (but) now is slightly disrupted."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Political and Security
Affairs Feisal Tanjung maintained that Australia should bear the
risk of troop deployment in East Timor in view of its unpopularity
among the Indonesian public.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a risk that Australian contingent might
face in East Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a senior adviser to Habibie, warned that
Australian troops could be singled out for militia attacks.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very strong feeling of animosity towards Australia,
rightly or wrongly, from the pro-integration forces in East
Timor," she said.
</P>
<P>
Two election winners, the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) and the Golkar Party, Wednesday appealed to the
United Nations to respect Indonesian sovereignty in East Timor up
to the general meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly in
November.
</P>
<P>
PDI-P Chairperson Megawati called on the Indonesian people to
control their emotion about any U.N. decision on the deployment of
troops in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Chairman Akbar Tanjung expressed his disappointment at
the Australian role. Australia's leadership in the force could
make the entire multinational force less than neutral, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday authorized a multinational
force to move into East Timor to restore peace and security there.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hailed the Australian
readiness to lead the force to be deployed immediately.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister John Moore was quoted by The
Indonesian Observer as saying the force is ready to leave for East
Timor no later than Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Dili, capital of East Timor, the Military Emergency Command
said it had begun preparations to make way for the arrival of the
multinational force.
</P>
<P>
Until the arrival of the U.N. force, TNI would continue with
its job of restoring peace in East Timor, particularly in Dili,
command chief Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri was quoted by The Jakarta
Post as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Positive on Second Sample Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica's world champion
Merlene Ottey is entitled to a hearing after her second sample
doping test returned positive.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) said in
Kingston on Wednesday that the International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) had advised that "the 'B' sample from Ottey has
also tested positive."
</P>
<P>
Under IAAF rules, the former 200 meters world champion was
entitled to a hearing by the IAAF and a panel would be set up to
hear the evidence to make a decision, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is expected to take place at the end of November
this year in order to "afford her a reasonable time to prepare",
it added.
</P>
<P>
Ottey's management company revealed on August 18 that the 39-
year-old sprinter had tested positive for the banned steroid
nandrolone at a grand prix meeting in Lucerne, Switzerland, on
July 5.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who has 14 world championship medals to her name, has
vowed to prove her innocence.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 16 (Xinhua)-- A tomb dating back to the
period between Song and Jin Dynasties (960 A.D.-1279) was
discovered in north China's Shanxi Province recently.
</P>
<P>
It was found by a group of construction workers on the site of
a residential building in the city of Houma. They immediately
reported it to local cultural relics department.
</P>
<P>
Further excavation shows that the tomb is 2.45-meters long and
2.38 meters wide with a brick chamber in which lay four skeletons
and some burial objects.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's inner walls were carved with magnificent designs
and scenes described in ancient stories.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists agreed that the tomb illustrated high-level
design and construction standards in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
It will add to the study of folk customs, architectural
characteristics and social development of the Song and Jin
Dynasties, they said.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Paraguayan General Warned Not to Perform Political Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
Wednesday warned exiled Paraguayan ex-general Lino Oviedo not to
plan or participate in political activities within the country.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Carlos Corach said that Argentina would
defend his right to asylum, but that it was also "inflexible" in
its decision to not permit Oviedo to participate in political
activities within the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition alliance, Oviedo held a political
meeting last Saturday in Argentina, which were attended by dozens
of his followers.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government's warning to Oviedo was made in
response to the political opposition's appeal to the Supreme
Court to have Argentina's denial of Paraguay's right of
extradition in the Oviedo case declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo came to Argentina for asylum on March 29. He was accused
of instigating the assassination of Paraguayan Vice-President Luis
Maria Argana on March 23. For that reason the Paraguayan justice
system has requested his extradition.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Boosts Garment, Textile Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made progress in
its efforts to boost garment and textile exports.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's garment and textile industry earned 1 billion U.S.
dollars from exports in the first eight months of this year, a
year-on-year increase of 8.4 percent, according to a report of
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year the industry has reduced the
average cost of production by 20 percent to raise the
competitiveness of its products. The industry plans to increase
its export turnover to more than 1.5 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam earned 1.38 billion dollars from garment and textile
exports last year as it increased labor productivity more than
three fold compared with 1992.
</P>
<P>
Although the labor productivity of Vietnam's garment and
textile industry has improved, its average labor cost per product
is still higher than that in China, Indonesia, Malaysia and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The average wage of Vietnamese textile and garment workers
increased from 200 dollars a year in 1990 to 550 dollars in 1996
and 690 dollars in 1998, according to the U.N. Industrial
Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's garment and textile industry now is facing
difficulties in narrowing the gap of development between the
garment and textile sectors. The export turnover of the garment
sector in 1998 increased 13 times over 1990 while that of the
textile sector went up only 6 times.he
weaving machines have been renewed and the rest are out-of-date
pieces of equipment that have been used for at least 25 years,
according to the Vietnam Garment and Textile Corporation.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation and reach the 1999 export target, VNA
reported, Vietnam's garment and textile enterprises should further
improve their products' quality and production efficiency by
improving the production process and improving management
practices. They should also promote marketing and diversify the
designs of their products.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Complete English Goalless Draw in Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea, which made its debut
at the Champions League, completed an English goalless draw with
rivals in the opening group phase on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The club, which finished third in the English Premier League
last season, played to a 0-0 draw with AC Milan at Stamford Bridge
in an absorbing match in which both teams unluckily hit the
woodwork.
</P>
<P>
Italian Gianfranco Zola hit Milan's post midway through the
second half, before Leonardo rattled Chelsea's crossbar soon after
with a left-foot, 25-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
All three English clubs in the Champions League drew 0-0 after
holders Manchester United finished goalless with Croatia Zagreb
and Arsenal were held by Fiorentina on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There was more excitement in the other Group H match in
Istanbul where Hertha Berlin raced into a 2-0 lead after only 12
minutes with goals from Michael Preetz at the 10th minute and
Daruisz Wosz two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
But Galatasaray, inspired by their fanatical fans in the Ali
Sami Yen Stadium, fought back for a point with a 21st minute goal
from Hakan Sukur and an 89th minute penalty from Gheorghe Hagi.
Kostas Konstatinidis of Hertha was shown the red card eight
minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Last season's beaten finalists Bayern Munich began their
Champions League campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over PSV
Eindhoven in their opening Group F match.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, lost to Manchester United in the emotional finishing
seconds of last season's final, won with two goals from Paulo
Sergio after 11 and 69 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Eindhoven's Dmitri Khokhlov scored for the Dutch side at the
59th minute and their miserable evening ended with Mark van Bommel
being sent off for a second bookable offense just before the end.
</P>
<P>
In the other Group F match Valencia beat Scottish champions
Rangers 2-0 with Kily Gonzalez scoring both goals for the home
side in an eight-minute spell midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
Following the opening night of Champions League action on
Tuesday in Groups A-D, the most dramatic match on Wednesday was in
Piraeus where Olympiakos and Real Madrid traded the lead in their
Group E Match before settling for a 3-3 draw.
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos appeared to be heading for a stunning 3-2 victory
over the former European champions when Zlatko Zahovic put them
ahead after 67 minutes to the delight of the 80,000 home fans.
</P>
<P>
But Real struck back with an equaliser from Raul 10 minutes
from time.
</P>
<P>
The Greek side, crushed 5-1 by Madrid in the same competition
two seasons ago, also scored through Brazilian Giovanni at the
10th and 64th minutes. Madrid's earlier goals were scored by
Savio at the 24th minute and Roberto Carlos (32nd).
</P>
<P>
In other Group E action, Deco scored an 88th minute winner for
Porto against Norwegians Molde.
</P>
<P>
In Group G Andrei Tikhonov scored all three Spartak Moscow
goals -- two from the spot -- as they beat Willem II Tilburg 3-1
in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The other match in the group between Sparta Prague and
Girondins Bordeaux ended in a 0-0 draw after Sparta captain Horst
Siegl missed a 55th minute penalty.

<HEADLINE>   O'Neill Could Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Leicester boss Martin O'Neill
has refused to rule out resigning in the wake of the latest
boardroom chaos at the club, according to local reports on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill promised he would "say something tomorrow" regarding
his future and, on the possibility of quitting, adding: "I'll have
a look at it.
</P>
<P>
"Let me put it this way - I really want to stay at this
football club," he said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill has become increasingly disillusioned with boardroom
rows deflecting from on-field matters.
</P>
<P>
Things came to a head once again this week when chief executive
Barry Pierpoint issued a statement on the Stock Exchange claiming
that chairman John Elsom and plc boss Sir Rodney Walker had
resigned.
</P>
<P>
Elsom and Walker have since denied that they have quit.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the latest row clearly angered O'Neill, who
agreed to stay at Filbert Street last year with the warning: "
There must be no more interference in football matters."
</P>
<P>
But O'Neill felt the latest row hampered the team's
preparations for last night's Worthington Cup match against
Crystal Palace.
</P>
<P>
He added: "Not just for myself, it's unsettling for the players
and it's unsettling for the whole football club as well.
</P>
<P>
"Sir Rodney Walker has made a statement today and I'll be
saying something tomorrow," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Weather Good For Farming And Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The favorable climate in the
Tibet Autonomous Region this summer has provided a good harvest
for farmers and herders and has been good for the fledgling
tourism industry
</P>
<P>
In July and August, while heatwaves hit much of China,
including Beijing, the capital, Tibet, in southwest China, was
having more rainfall and cooler weather than normal. Local
meteorologists and agronomists attribute this to the La Nina
effect and lower temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, where warm,
wet fronts originated and headed north to meet the cold air on the
Tibet-Qinghai Plateau.
</P>
<P>
And, the efforts to bring more new technology to herding and
farming have paid off, analysts say.

LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea manager Gianluca
Vialli was a proud man as his club matched AC Milan for quality in
their Champions League opener at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gianfranco Zola came within inches of bagging a winner for
Chelsea when he hit the post, though Milan almost stole victory
when Brazilian star Leonardo struck the bar with five minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud of my players because to play so well against
a team like AC Milan is something to be proud of," said Vialli
after the match finished goalless.
</P>
<P>
"We showed we can compete with everybody, we are good enough to
be in the Champions League.

"It's not going to be easy, it's going to be difficult but we
started quite well with one point."

Vialli was especially pleased with Chelsea's first-half display,
when the Blues dominated the Italian giants.

"In the second half it was more difficult - we got tired and
they played better," he said. "We had a few chances, we hit the
post -but they hit the bar with five minutes to go.

"It is a shame we didn't score and obviously we regret that a
little bit but in our first match I think we did very well," he

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Reaffirms Stance to Cut Crude Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez on Wednesday reaffirmed his country's stance to cut crude
oil production.
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in increasing our production", said
Chavez, adding that Venezuela would hold the agreement of cutting
production which it has with Mexico and other OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who advocates stability in the world-wide petroleum
market, observed that the fluctuation of price creates distortions
in the market of producing countries as well as in the consumer
countries.
</P>
<P>
The independent oil exporters and OPEC members agreed on April
1 to cut crude production by 2.1 million barrels per day for a
year in order to recuperate the petroleum prices in the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
Chavez insisted that his government should propose to OPEC to
adopt a floatation band to realize higher stability of the
petroleum prices.

OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada expressed welcome
Wednesday to the unanimous passage of the United Nations Security
Council resolution on East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement

<HEADLINE> Global Broadband Satellite Revenue to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide broadband
satellite revenues will increase from 230 million U.S. dollars
this year to 37 billion dollars in 2008, according to an analysis
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total revenue, residential service will contribute the
majority, with almost 22 billion dollars in 2008, according to a
report from Pioneer Consulting, a U.S. firm specializing in global
high-speed telecommunications network market research.
</P>
<P>
Total revenues of both business and residential services will
double between 2001 and 2002, from 3 billion dollars to 6 billion
dollars, and jump again from 16 billion dollars to 31 billion
dollars between 2004 and 2007.
</P>
<P>
According to the market research firm, North America will be
the largest market for broadband service, due to the strong desire
for higher bandwidth by residential users and the willingness of
business users to try new access technologies.
</P>
<P>
Asia will be second in revenue at the end of the forecast
period, ahead of Europe, due to the predicted popularity of
residential broadband satellite access.

<HEADLINE> North China's Port City Active in Trade Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Port, the largest
man-made port in north China and also the gateway to the Chinese
capital, has in the past 15 years opened over 60 international
navigation lines and set up trade relationships with more than 300
ports in some 160 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It has also forged friendly ties with Japan's Tokyo and Kobe
ports, Philadelphia in the United States, Australia's Melbourne,
France's Marseilles, the Netherlands' Amsterdam, the Inchon Port
of the Republic of Korea, and Belgium's Bruges.
</P>
<P>
And among the 43 joint ventures in the port area, the Port of
Tianjin Commercial Bonded Warehousing and Service Co. Ltd. has
been most successful. A cooperative venture with the Royal
Nedlloyd Group N.V. Rotterdam, the Netherlands, it is the first
commerce-oriented warehousing firm in China.
</P>
<P>
The firm, offering storage services and simple processing to
the automobile, clothing, and chemical materials both for import
and export, operates under a management structure similar to
foreign tax-free ports or free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, some 2,000 enterprises with a total investment of 3
billion U.S. dollars have settled in the Tianjin Free Trade Zone
since its establishment in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Half of the port's 43 joint ventures, dealing mainly in storage,
international trade, and raw materials processing on client demand,
have also chosen the zone for its preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
The Xingang area, south of the port, where the Free Trade Zone
is located, is of extreme importance to the port's prospects in
the 21st century, said officials in charge of port affairs
administration.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a dozen foreign firms have in the last three years
invested in the five-sq km developed area of Xingang, and
multinationals like Esso, Mobile, and Shell have already set up
their branches or agencies there, added the officials.
</P>
<P>
Among the first 14 coastal cities approved by the State Council
to be open to foreign countries in 1984, Tianjin is the most
highly favored.

<HEADLINE> Mammoth Fossil Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The fossil remains of a
mammoth have been discovered in the north China city of Manzhouli
(Manchuria) on the Sino-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
This is yet another major archaeological discovery, which
brings the number of mammoth fossils ever found in China up to
four.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, this fossil is 2.6 meters long and
20 centimeters in diameter at the basis. It was discovered four
meters deep by local residents Wang Xudong and his father as they
were building a vegetable cellar outside their house. The cellar
is now sealed off.
</P>
<P>
Mammoths were a kind of large elephant which lived some 30,000
years ago. In 1980 and 1983, coal miners with the Zhalainuo'er
Mining Administration in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region unearthed the fossil remains of three other mammoths 40
meters beneath the ground while digging in eastern Manzhouli.

<HEADLINE> Drought Reduces Grain Output in North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 16 (Xinhua)-- North China's Hebei
Province says it is sure to have a decline in grain output this
year following a heavy drought.
</P>
<P>
The provincial drought-control office said that half of its 3.
04 million hectares of farmland has suffered the drought, which
lasted form November last year to March this year. During this
period, an average of 9.3 millimeters of rainfall was recorded,
less than one-third of the province's normal amount.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 rivers ceased flowing and over 60 percent of the
wells dried up in Hebei. By the end of August, 1.5 million people
and some 400,000 livestock had insufficient drinking water. Among
those hard hit are the traditionally poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The government of this major grain producing province has
mobilized local people and material recourses to fight the drought,
focusing efforts on bringing drinking water and ensuring a best
possible autumn harvest.

<HEADLINE> Former Mexican Prosecutor Suspected Committing Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's former top drug
prosecutor, Mario Ruiz Massieu, who fled from authorities in his
own country in 1995 and was arrested in the United States, was
found dead on Wednesday in New Jersey, USA.
</P>
<P>
Massieu, whose extradition was refused three times by U.S.
authorities, reportedly died from an overdose of anti-depression
tablets in his apartment, said a spokesman from the Mexican
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Massieu, who left Mexico in 1995 after a split with the Mexican
government, was the brother of the assassinated secretary general
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Francisco
Ruiz Massieu.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities declined to confirm whether the death was
a suicide. The body was discovered on Wednesday afternoon in his
apartment in Palisades Park, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
The ex-prosecutor, who was under house arrest in his New Jersey
apartment, was to appear before the Houston court on Friday, where
he was facing charges of laundering money.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. authorities had found bank accounts belonging to
Massieu, containing almost 9 million dollars, which supposedly
came from laundering money and trafficking in drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican authorities were in the process of preparing for
the fourth time an attempt to extradite Massieu, whom they also
accused of money laundering, illegal enrichment, drug trafficking
and obstruction of justice in the death of the former secretary
general of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
Massieu was captured in 1995 in Newark Airport, New Jersey, en
route to Spain, with 50,000 dollars in cash in his possession. He
was arrested for "failing to make a proper declaration".

<HEADLINE> Chile to Appeal to the Hague on Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister
Juan Gabriel Valdes said on Wednesday that Chile has no other
option than to appeal to the International Court of the Hague, as
Spain refused an arbitration to end the case of former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Valdes said at a press conference that to put the case to the
Hague is not only for the sake of resolving the conflict
immediately, but is indispensable to clear up the issue of
extraterritoriality.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish attitude, in its refusal to allow arbitration or
diplomatic negotiation on the case, makes it impossible "to
resolve the theme between equals".
</P>
<P>
Valdes did not rule out the probability of withdrawing the
Chilean ambassador to Spain in the next few hours, but added that
measures to be taken would be studied by the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, has been under arrest in London since last
October 16 on a warrant from Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon. Spain
wants him extradited to its territory for trial. A hearing on the
request is to begin September 27.
</P>
<P>
Chile has repeatedly demanded that Pinochet be allowed to
return home for trial. It has asked Spain to agree to
international arbitration on who has jurisdiction over the case.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Sees Possible Casualties in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian troops going into
East Timor are facing a high degree of risk and the public should
prepare itself for the possibility of casualties, Prime Minister
John Howard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Howard's comments came amid warnings that militias in East
Timor could target Australians.
</P>
<P>
Howard said there was no doubt Australian troops face risks in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a dangerous operation and I've never pretended
otherwise," Howard told ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
"And I think the Australian public must prepare itself for all
of the consequences that could be involved in an operation like
this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government had made sure the element of risk
to Australian soldiers is as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have achieved that. But there comes a point at
which you can't deploy a peacekeeping force without accepting a
degree of risk," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday authorized a multinational
force to move into East Timor to restore peace and security there.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Taiwan Attempt Doomed to Failure? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Committee voted overwhelmingly Wednesday against the
proposed reconsideration of Taiwan's representation at the United
Nations, highlighting a doomed failure for the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua and other 11 countries addressed a letter on August
11 to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, urging the U.N. to
examine Taiwan's "exceptional international situation" and allow
the island to return to the U.N. as an independent country. But
it's defeat is completely predictable and even the Taiwan
authorities has cautioned against over-optimism.
</P>
<P>
It is the seventh time since 1993 that Taiwan, through a small
group of countries, tried but failed to place its issue on the
agenda of a General Assembly session. But this time things became
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The latest Taiwan attempt came amid tension buildup between the
mainland China and Taiwan. The "special state-to-state relations"
advocated by Taiwan recently has driven the world leaders to
tackle with the Taiwan issue more carefully.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the pro-Taiwan countries mirrored the island's
two-country definition, putting the People's Republic and Taiwan
on an equal footing. This has undoubtedly drawn sharp criticism
from Beijing at first.
</P>
<P>
Beijing considers Taiwan as one of its provinces and its
legitimate representation at the U.N. was restored in October 1971
when Resolution 2758 was adopted and the People's Republic was
recognized as "the only legitimate representatives of China" at
the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
China's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun was
quick to reassert on August 19 that the issue of China's
representation at the U.N. has already been solved "in a just,
thorough and comprehensive manner" and there is no need to take it
up again.
</P>
<P>
It is recognized worldwide that as a permanent member of the
Security Council, China carries undeniable weight in international
affairs and Beijing's consistent warning against foreign
intervention in its internal affairs can not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Particularly when Taiwan's "special state-to-state relations"
leaves little room for Beijing, which has never given up its right
to use force in case of Taiwan independence and foreign
aggression, The United States and many other countries are worried
about the possible outbreak of military conflicts in the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has followed the "One China" policy in
the past two decades but sold arms to Taiwan according to its
domestic law, found itself in a dilemma. President Bill Clinton
has ruled out on many occasions any change in the U.S. China
policy, while urging the two sides of Taiwan Strait to continue
dialogue to achieve peaceful reunification. He went a step forward
this weekend in New Zealand to admit that Taiwan's two-state
definition had really troubled both China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, no one could hope the U.S. would come
to aid Taiwan in its attempt to swing back to the U.N.. Eventually
in the past six years, Washington never took the Taiwan side
publicly and this time it is almost impossible for the superpower
to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Russia has made it clear that it opposes the reconsideration of
Taiwan's representation at the U.N.. The other big powers like
France and Britain will unlikely challenge China's legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The number of proponents of Taiwan's representation is of no
significance in comparison with the vast majority of developing
countries, who had thrown their total weight behind China in early
1970s and never hesitated to beat back Taiwan's attempt to return
to the U.N. in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
Neither should one expect Taiwan to openly admit defeat nor
believe it will stop trying in vain. But Taiwan's dream may never
come true since China is standing on solid legitimate ground while
growing ever stronger.

<HEADLINE> Heyns Wins 100M Breaststroke at All Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's double
Olympic champion Penny Heyns blitzed her second-fastest time on
home soil as she won All Africa Games gold in the women's 100
meters breaststroke at a packed Ellis Park here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The triple world record holder clocked a Games record in one
minute 7.58 seconds -- more than a second slower than the 1:06,52
world mark she set at the Pan Pacific Championships in Sydney last
month.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, who has successfully defended the 100m and 200m titles
she won at the previous Games in Harare in 1995, was followed home
by compatriot Ziada Jardine in a personal best of 1:15.31 and
Lauren Harvey of Zimbabwe in 1:18.05.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if it was perfect conditions, sea level and all that..
. I don't say I would have beaten the world record, but I would
have come close," said Heyns, also owner of the 50m and 200m world
marks.
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to know I can hold my condition on a long taper,"
added the crowd favorite, who rested properly after setting four
world records at the Pan Pacs.
</P>
<P>
"Part of me wanted to swim only to win tonight, but that would
have been unfair on the crowd. Given the altitude, I swam it the
best I could. I went out slow to bring it in fast," she added.
</P>
<P>
For 14-year-old Jardine, the silver medal marks her first
international show since being included in the South African team
as a development swimmer a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South Africa also claimed gold-silver finishes in the
earlier individual races.
</P>
<P>
Deaf swimmer from Durban Terence Parkin and Johannesburg blonde
Mandy Loots, already the men's and women's 400m individual medley
title holders, set Games records as they claimed their second gold
medals of the competition.
</P>
<P>
Pan Pacs bronze medalist Parkin easily took the 200m
breaststroke, racing the four laps in a speedy 2:16.29.
</P>
<P>
Greg Owen was second in 2:21.14 and Ayman Khattab of Egypt
finished third in 2:26.98.
</P>
<P>
Loots had no difficulty winning the women's 100m butterfly,
touching in 1:01,32. Candice Crafford won the silver in 1:03.64
and Zimbabwean Teresa Moodie finished third in 1:05.18.
</P>
<P>
And Free Stater Ryno Markgraaff, who trains with triple Pan
Pacs medalist Ryk Neethling at the University of Arizone in Tuscon,
won the men's 400m freestyle in 4:06.93.
</P>
<P>
James Willcox took the silver in 4:08.00 and Glen Walshaw of
Zimbabwe was third in 4:09.65.

<HEADLINE> General Committee Decides Not to Consider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Committee on Wednesday decided not to consider the issue
of the so-called "Taiwan's participation at the United Nations" in
the 54th session of the Genera Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the General Committee held hours of debate
on the issue. It has been the seventh year that the General Committee
made such a decision, which foiled Taiwan's plots aiming at
splitting a sovereign country and creating"two Chinas", "one
China, one Taiwan" or "one country, two governments."
</P>
<P>
Representatives from sixty-eight countries made statements
during the debate. Most of the countries, including the United
States, Britain, France and Spain, firmly opposed the proposal and
reiterated their countries' position of "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Tanzania and Pakistan stressed that the
issue of so-called "Taiwan's participation at the United
Nations has already been solved by Resolution 2758 adopted at
the 26th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and
that the proposal had been repeatedly rejected by the
General Committee.
</P>
<P>
They said this should be the last time to debate on this issue
and the United Nations should concentrate its sources on matters
which need urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
On August 11, 1999, Nicaragua and a very small number of other
countries addressed a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which they requested to inscribe in the agenda of the
54th session of the General Assembly an item of the so-called
"Taiwan's participation at the United Nations."
</P>

Assembly and the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, and the chairs

<HEADLINE> Italy to Send 600 Troops to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Italy will send 600 soldiers to
participate in the UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor, with a
company of 200 parachute troops expected to arrive in the island
within five to seven days, the Italian Defense Ministry said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the United Nations Security Council's approval of a
peacekeeping force early Wednesday morning, the ministry said 600
Italian troops would be sent to the island, including two hundred
from the Folgore regiment, who have been standing by since moves
to create an international peace force began.
</P>
<P>
The troops will be joining an 8,000-strong force in which there
will be 4,500 Australians. About 2,000 Australians with British
Gurkhas and troops from New Zealand are expected to disembark
within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The first task will be to take control of the airport at Dili,
the East Timorese capital, and the port. Italy's parachute troops,
for example, will be flown to Dili, and Italy will also deploy a
G-222 plane for tactical air support.
</P>
<P>
Most Italian troops and supplies will be transported by sea on
board the San Giusto, which recently took part in humanitarian
operations for earthquake-stricken Turkey, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The San Giusto left the port of Brindisi Wednesday afternoon
for La Spezia, where it will load soldiers and supplies. It is
expected to arrive in East Timor within four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the United Nations revealed that Indonesian
paramilitary troops had already started leaving East Timor ahead
of the arrival of peacekeeping forces.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton is expected to ease sanctions as early as this week on the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), an administration
official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president may well announce something this week," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the action would allow bank transfers between the
two countries, open up commerce and allow port calls by ships.
</P>
<P>
But the United States would not support international loans
to the DPRK, or permit technology transfers or foreign
assistance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger recommended the sanction easing this week
after the two countries made some progress on the missile test in
their talks in Berlin last week.

<HEADLINE> Benefits of Caffeine on Alertness May Be Less Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Caffeine-filled cups of tea
and coffee may not really provide the boost to alertness that
people think, British researchers said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New study by Dr Peter Rogers, a psychologist from Britian's
University of Bristol, showed regular caffeine consumers
experience significant negative effects following overnight
abstinence from caffeine.
</P>
<P>
Dr Rogers and his colleagues found that caffeine consumption
after overnight caffeine abstinence appears to merely restore mood
and performance to "normal" levels.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, caffeine influenced the participant's liking
for the drink mainly because it relieved the negative effects
arising from withdrawal from the caffeine they had consumed the
previous day," Rogers told the British Association's Festival of
Science in Sheffield, England.
</P>
<P>
The researchers tested their idea in studies in which caffeine
ingestion was paired with the consumption of novel-flavored fruit
juices.
</P>
<P>
The results, as expected, showed that caffeine acts most
reliably as a reinforcer of overnight caffeine withdrwal,
relieving negative states such as feelings of fatigue and
tiredness.
</P>
<P>
The new study may help explain the popularity of caffeine
containing drinks, while at the same time suggesting that regular
caffeine consumption benefits mental alertness much less than is
generally supposed, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Forces Millions to Evacuate in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- More than three million
Americans fled inland Wednesday as Hurricane Floyd thrashed along
the U.S. southeast coast, pounding beaches with heavy surf and
ripping down tree limbs and power lines.
</P>
<P>
About 3.2 million people had been urged to evacuate, said
officials in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, and more people
joined the exodus Wednesday in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Federal emergency officials said it was the biggest evacuation
in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Florida residents were without power, but that
state escaped the worst as Floyd swung northward.
</P>
<P>
Virginia and Maryland have declared states of emergency and
asked residents of waterfront and low-lying areas to make
preliminary evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
The storm weakened slightly Wednesday to a Category 3
hurricane, with sustained wind blowing at 200 kph instead of the
peak of nearly 250 kph when it battered the Bahamas. The enormous
storm spread rain along the coast from Florida to Connecticut, and
heavy surf advisories were posted as far north as Massachusetts'
Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, the storm's center was about 345
kilometers south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Floyd was moving
north-northwest near 22 kph, and a turn to the north and increase
in forward speed was expected later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that President Bill
Clinton had declared states of emergency in South Carolina and
North Carolina, making them eligible for federal disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Floyd's expected track would take its wind and rain across
Virginia, the District of Columbia, Maryland and Delaware, eastern
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the New York City area, and into
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and
Canada's Maritime Provinces by Saturday night.

<P>
MADRID, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish Senate on
Wednesday approved unanimously a declaration of supporting the UN
urgent intervention in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the international force will be to end the
violations of the most elemental human rights and also to uphold
the results of the referendum on independence.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the Senate showed it was convinced that "it
is necessary to respect the result of the democratic
consultation", in which the population of Timor showed "their
unequivocal will to govern themselves" in the face of the
generalized violence being experienced in the zone.
</P>
<P>
They request the UN to exercise its obligation to protect the
population, with the help of the whole international community and
that the intervention should be urgent "because Timor is enduring
new excesses and persecutions".
</P>
<P>
The Senate urged the UN to act with the necessary speed to end
the suffering of the population of East Timor as soon as possible,
and to re-establish the popular will of the people to live in
peace and liberty.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Leader Calls for Team to Bosnia on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. House
leader called for a special international team to be sent to
Bosnia to fight against corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing of the House International Relations
Committee on corruption in Bosnia, Benjamin Gilman, chairman of
the House International Relations Committee, said the team should
be composed of special judicial officials and investigators.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is the first of a series on the corruption in
Bosnia that may have led to the diversion of up to one billion
U.S. dollars of assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported on August 17 that international
donors to Bosnia may have lost one billion U.S. dollars since the
signing of the Dayton peace plan in late 1995. Of the lost money,
the U.S. share was at least 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia is one of the largest recipients of foreign aid in the
world on a per capita basis.
</P>
<P>
"While the U.S. and other European donors have not suffered
losses so great as alleged, corruption does impede progress
towards our major goals in Bosnia," Gilman told the hearing.
</P>
<P>
A Congressional staff team sent by Gilman to Bosnia after the
New York Times report came back and found that corruption does
exist in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"In the most shocking revelation, we found that funds to
provide gravestones for the victims of the Srebrenica massacre
were stolen by the canton's prime minister. Hundreds of millions
of dollars were stolen in various scams," Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the team also found that local Bosnian officials
refused to cooperate with the international community to fight
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Gilman suggests a team of "untouchable investigators and judges
to clean up Bosnia." "It should be highly trained to try to
remediate this mess," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the hearing, Ambassador Larry C. Napper, the
State Department's coordinator on assistance in Eastern Europe,
said the administration already was planning to intensify its
2-year-old fight against Bosnian crime and corruption.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sees Doubling of Online Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Online shopping has doubled in
the past year in Britain, said an annual survey carried out by
Which?Online, the Internet arm of UK Consumers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 2,000 people across Britain showed that 58
percent of those who had been online for more than two years had
bought something.
</P>
<P>
It also found books, flights and holidays have taken over from
computer hardware and software as the most popular products being
sold.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10 million people in Britain, about
one-sixth of the population, are now using the Internet. But it
appears that the high cost of phone calls continues to limit the
amount of time the surfers spent online.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that three-quarters of users surf the
Internet for five hours or less a week and visit on average 13
websites a week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices and Business Inventories Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices rose
0.3 percent in August as energy costs surged for a second
consecutive month, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In both August and July, energy was the big force pushing
prices upward. For August, two-thirds of the total price increase
was attributed to a 2.7 percent jump in energy costs. Food costs
edged up a small 0.2 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile energy and food categories, prices
were up just 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
This performance of the "core" rate of inflation was even
better than economists' expectations and will provide ammunition
for those arguing there is no need for the Federal Reserve to
boost interest rates for a third time.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 2.6 percent, compared with a gain of just 1.6 percent for
all of 1998. However, all of the increase reflects higher energy
costs, which have rebounded this year after a steep plunge in 1998
that reflected slumping global demand in the wake of steep
recessions in many nations hit by a global currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The August's 2.7 percent jump in energy costs was even bigger
than July's 2.1 percent increase. Gasoline prices advanced 5.6
percent last month and are up 25.1 percent at an annual rate so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent rise in food prices in August matched the
modest July increase. Clothing prices fell by 0.3 percent, the
fourth consecutive drop.
</P>
<P>
Airline fares fell by 2.7 percent in August after having posted
a sharp 6.5 percent increase in July.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said that
inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots increased
by 0.3 percent in July while business sales jumpedat an even
faster 0.4 percent clip.
</P>
<P>
So that made the ratio of inventories to sales at a record
low of 1.34 months, meaning it would take this length of time to
exhaust supplies at the current sales pace.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Wednesday
passed a defense bill including military pay raise.
</P>
<P>
The 289-billion-U.S.-dollar bill, 8.3 billion U.S. dollars more
than sought by President Bill Clinton, cleared 375-45, despite
concerns raised by a number of Democrats about the degree of
autonomy given the new, largely independent nuclear weapons agency
within the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
The compromise bill, which was already approved by a House and
Senate conference, must still be given final approval by the
Senate before it is sent to the White House.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Administration officials indicated a possible veto over
the nuclear weapons agency, but congressional Republicans and
Democrats said a veto would be politically difficult given the
widespread support for the defense package.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes a widely popular 4.8 percent military pay
raise, more money for military barracks and family housing and
increase spending for military hardware -- everything from 176
million U.S. dollars for 17 new Black Hawk helicopters to 3.7
billion U.S. dollars for a ballistic missile defense system.

<HEADLINE> Protein Finding Raises New Hope for TB Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Proteins found in tuberculosis
(TB) bacterium acting as wake-up call for dormant bacteria and as
growth factors may help create future TB drugs and vaccines,
British scientists said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Mike Young, of the University of Wales at
Aberystwyth, was studying bacteria related to TB when he
discovered that they produce a chemical "alarm call" that rouses
other bacteria of that species from dormancy.
</P>
<P>
"The protein is not just a wake-up call but also a growth
factor for the bacteria," Professor Young told the British
Association's Festival of Science held in Sheffield, England.
</P>
<P>
After studying genetic blueprint of TB bacterium, which has
4,000 sequenced genes, the researchers found that the TB bug
produces five growth factor proteins with similar properties.
</P>
<P>
Professor Young said that if the human immune system can be
persuaded to recognize those proteins, it could lead to TB
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
Understanding how the proteins control growth and finding ways
to block them could also make it possible to prevent an infection
developing into the disease.
</P>
<P>
A third of world's population may carry the TB bacterium in its
dormant form, but they cannot be treated because anti-TB drugs
only work if the bacteria are active.
</P>
<P>
The newly-discovered proteins could be used to wake up a
dormant infection and force the bacteria into an active state,
which the researchers believed would allow the bugs to be attacked
by drugs and cleared.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Wednesday as investors feared higher interest rates
despite little evidence of rising inflation in a government
report.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 108.91 at
10,801.42, adding to a loss of 120.00 Tuesday.

Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 18.32 at 1,317.97 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 54.12 at 2,814.17.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index
rose 0.3 percent in August, matching the July advance. But the
modest increase did not convince investors that the Federal
Reserve will not raise interest rates for a third time this year
in its effort to fight inflation.
</P>
<P>
The continued weakness in the U.S. dollar also drove stocks
lower. The dollar slid to 104.29 against Japanese yen from
105.79 Tuesday in New York, putting more pressures on stocks.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 6.64 at 608.47 and the American Stock
