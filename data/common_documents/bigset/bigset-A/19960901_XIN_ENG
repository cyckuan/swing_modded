<HEADLINE> Mass Pray Expected Sunday at Christian Church in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A mass protest pray is
expected at the Church of Holy Sepulcher in east Jerusalem
Sunday, as Palestinians continued the campaign against Israel's
hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Radio Palestine, the official voice of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), issued a call today for Christians and
Israeli Arab residents in east Jerusalem to attend Sunday's
morning pray to protest Israel's policies on settlements and east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the morning pray today, Christian leaders in
east Jerusalem joined the call, urging Christians to come to the
Holy Church of Sepulcher in the Old City to hold the protest pray.
</P>
<P>
They described the current situation between Israel and
Palestinians as "on the brink of explosion" as a result of
Israeli government's hardline policies to expand Jewish
settlements in Palestinian territories and increase Jewish
presence in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The latest development followed a two-day protest called by
PNA President Yasser Arafat on Wednesday. Palestinians in the
self-rule areas staged a four-hour general strike, first in two
years, and over 15,000 Moslems attended Friday's protest prayer
at the AL-Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No incident of violence has happened, but the situation
was explosive as thousands of Israeli armed police and troops
were put on high alert against possible Palestinian unrest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat warned Friday and today that Palestinians
would revive the Intifada, or armed Arab uprising from 1987 to
1993, if Israel continues adopting the policies of intransigence
and refusing to implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
During the Intifada, about 2,000 Palestinians, many of them
stone-throwing teenagers, were killed by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to calm down the tension, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has initiatived several high-level contacts
with the PNA in recent days. He also promised that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks would resume next week after a
six-month freeze.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees to Stage Sit-In in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 Bhutanese refugees,
who were deported to India two weeks ago after entering Bhutan on
a peace march, will stage a sit-in in the first week of September,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
A Bhutanese refugee group said in a press release issued from
an Eastern Nepali town that the sit-in is aimed at drawing the
attention of the Indian government to create an atmosphere for the
refugees to return to Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Movement Coordinating Council (AMCC) said it had
written to Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and other Indian
leaders calling for humanitarian assistance in the repatriation of
nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, mostly living in eight refugee
camps in Eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But no positive measures have been taken by India so far, the
AMCC press release said.
</P>
<P>
The 150 Bhutanese refugees were deported by Bhutanese police to
India shortly after they entered Bhutan via India on August 15 on
a peace march appealing for the free repatriation of all Bhutanese
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The deported peace marchers have put up a camp at an Eastern
Indian town near the Bhutanese border, the AMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the AMCC, the Bhutanese government has
deployed over 2,000 troops and policemen along the border to
prevent future attempts by refugee marchers to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees from Bhutan flooded into Nepal via India
six years ago when the Bhutanese government claimed that they,
mostly of Nepalese origin, are not genuine Bhutanese citizens.

<HEADLINE> France: Foreign Troops Involved in Fighting in N.Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- France said today that foreign
troops have been involved in the fighting in the Kurdish area in
northern Iraq for a few days and the situation in the area is
"confusing."
</P>
<P>
"The fightings have unrolled between the forces of the Kurdish
Democratic Party supported by Baghdad, for one side, and the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), associated with the foreign
forces present for a few days in the region, for another side,''
said a French Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the spokesman referred the foreign forces
to Iranian troops which Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
today accused of being involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also accused Jalal Talabani, head of the PUK, of being "in
treason and allying himself with enemies of Iraq and the Kurds."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops, backed by 450 tanks, attacked this morning PUK
positions around Irbil, one of Kurdistan's main cities, forcing a
large number of people to flee their homes, according to reports
from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
U.S., French and British air forces are stationed in southern
Turkey to protect the Iraqi Kurds by imposing a no-fly zone in
Iraqi territory north of the 36th parallel, within which area
Irbil is located.

<HEADLINE> US Closely Monitoring, Evaluating Iraq's Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The White House is closely
monitoring and evaluating the situation in northern Iraq as Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops into this Kurdish
enclave and launched attacks on Irbil, which has made the already
worsening situation more complicated.
</P>
<P>
"The White House is aware of and evaluating reports of fighting
in and around Irbil and will make further announcements or
notifications to the press at an appropriate time," White House
spokesman Jim Fetig said today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz confirmed today that
Iraqi tanks were attacking the northern Iraqi city of Irbil in a
bid to dislodge what he said the Iranian-backed forces of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
He said Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Massoud Barzani
invited the Iraqi government to intervene.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow Iran to control directly or indirectly through
the gang of (PUK leader) Jalal Talabani," as it would "constitute
a real threat to Iraq's sovereignty, security and national unity,"
Aziz told the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi forces were providing "limited" help to the KDP, Aziz
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has ordered the military in the Persian Gulf
to prepare itself for any possible redeployment as precautionary
steps and warned Iraq not to intervene in the Kurdish area, a "no
fly" zone, created by U.S.-led allies right after the Gulf War in
1991 to protect Kurds living there from the Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said President Bill Clinton
has ordered that "steps be taken to ensure the United States is
prepared for any contingency."
</P>
<P>
"The United States is monitoring very closely indications that
Iraqi military units near Irbil, in northern Iraq, have been
brought into positions and levels of readiness that would enable
them to undertake offensive action," he said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher sent a letter to
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller requesting Ankara's
intervention to restore calm.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Christopher urged "Turkey to persuade Iraq to
stay out of northern Iraq and to explain the dark consequences of"
its intervention, according to the Associated Press, which was
told by a U.S. embassy official in Ankara, capital of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is contemplating a number of military moves. These
so-called precautionary steps include moving an Air Force
expeditionary group of 30 fighter aircraft into Jordan or
somewhere else nearby, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The USS aircraft carriers Enterprise in the eastern
Mediterranean and the Carl Vinson in the Persian Gulf have been
told to be prepared to move on short notice, they said.
</P>
<P>
The PUK and the KDP were allies in the 1991 rebellion against
Saddam, but the uprising was crushed by the Iraqi military,
leading to an exodus of Kurds to the neighboring countries of
Turkey and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two factions later turned against each other and, on August
17 this year, fighting flared up again amid differences over
customs revenues from a road between Turkey and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said KDP leader Barzani pleaded with Saddam in an August
22 letter to intervene to "thwart the Iranian threat." Iran is
alleged to support the KDP's rival the PUK.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq's decision to launch a limited military
operation is to defend "our sovereignty, our people and their
properties."
</P>
<P>
He condemned U.S., British and French forces in northern Iraq,
saying their presence "has brought to the Kurds nothing but death,
destruction, anarchy and the loss of opportunities for development
and decent living."

<HEADLINE> Afghan Government Accepts Taliban Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government has
accepted a peace proposal presented by the Taliban concerning the
formation of an interim government in the war-torn Afghanistan and
invited the latter to come to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
This was claimed today by a 50-member delegation of Pakistani
religious scholars who returned to Pakistan's northwestern city of
Peshawar after holding meetings with Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Rabbani's close
aid Masood Shah in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The peace mission headed by Abdur Rehman said here that the
Afghan president has offered an olive branch to the Taliban force,
and asked the Taliban to choose any process of election on the
basis of which an Islamic government would be shaped up.
</P>
<P>
The delegation informed the Kabul government of a three-point
proposal offered by the Taliban for starting negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes the announcement of an Islamic system,
upon which an interim government should be formed, disarmament of
important cities including Kabul and the removal of dishonest
people who were holding key positions in the Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hekmatyar accepted the formation of an interim
government and presented his own five-point proposal for the
restoration of peace.
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes declaration of ceasefire, formation of an
interim government through negotiations and establishment of an
electoral system.
</P>
<P>
The peace mission will meet the Taliban next week to apprise
them of the Kabul government's proposal.
</P>
<P>
Rehman said that both the Afghan president and prime minister
showed willingness to sacrifice their offices if needed for the
formation of an Islamic government in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main purpose of the delegation was to
reconcile the two warring Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Pakistan and other Muslim countries to play
their due role in restoring peace in Afghanistan.

PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
worried about the evolution of the situation in the Palestinian
autonomous territories and the threats which hang today above the

</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry is, however, satisfied that the
protests by Palestinians Thursday and Friday, called by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in reaction to Israel's decision
to expand Jewish settlement, went on in calmness without causing
incidents, according to a communique issued by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will convey France's
worries over the situation in the Mideast to his Israeli
counterpart, David Levy, when they meet in Paris Sunday, said the

De Charette also made a telephone call to Egyptian Foreign

Egypt are also those of France."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara, as well as U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, will visit Paris in early September.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Expects Detailed Lebed Report on Chechnya Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said
today that the peace agreement signed today by his Chechnya envoy
Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military chief Aslan
Maskhadov needs additional consideration and further clarification.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin,
who is on holiday, needed time to analyze the deal signed by Lebed
and Maskhadov in Khasavyurt, a town outside Chechnya, because
changes had been made by both sides during the latest round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
The accord is on the whole based on a plan approved by the
government and Yeltsin, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But the president expects from the Security Council Secretary a
detailed report with a clarification of the details of the
agreements, Yastrzhembsky told Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
On August 29, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin chaired a
meeting attended by top officials from the country's key
departments and both houses of the parliament to discuss Lebed's
plan on the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was reportedly under Yeltsin's direct instruction.
</P>
<P>
The deal put off a decision on the status of Chechnya, a
central issue of the conflict, until December 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
It also provided for the creation of a joint commission which
would monitor Russian troops' withdrawal from Chechnya and work
out proposals on financial relations between Russia and Chechnya
as well as an economic and social recovery program.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, on holiday near Moscow, gave Lebed sweeping but
unspecified powers to stop the conflict, which began in December
1994.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lebed signed a truce to end some of the worst
fightings in the Chechen capital, Grozny, after the rebels
attacked the city on August 6.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Not to Allow New PKK Migration Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will not allow the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) to get benefits from the
clashes in northern Iraq and will try to prevent a new migration
operation from northern Iraq to the Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued today by the Turkish Foreign
Ministry, Turkey will take all the necessary measures to prevent
the developments in this direction.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey called on all the sides
concerned in northern Iraq to immediately stop the clashes.
</P>
<P>
If the sides refrain from action which would escalate the
tension, this will contribute to the security and stability in
the region, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops launched attacks early today on Kurdish guerrillas
in northern Iraq with heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said today in a
statement that the Iraqi forces staged the "limited operation" at
the request by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The KDP is battling another Kurdish faction named the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) for supremacy in the
mountainous region where the U.S.-led coalition forces established
an enclave after the 1991 Gulf war for the Kurdish people
seeking independence from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops
into Kurdistan after the KDP leader Massoud Barzani asked him to
intervene on August 22.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the KDP
and its rival PUK began fighting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Iran of backing the PUK, but Tehran made no
official comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered the
U.S. troops to get ready for possible deployment in the Gulf in
case Iraqi troops cross into the Kurdish "no fly" zone in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is monitoring very closely indications that
Iraqi military units near Irbil, in northern Iraq, have been

<HEADLINE> General Election Possible This Year in Japan: LDP Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto may dissolve the House of Representatives of the Diet
for an early general election this October, Kyodo News Service
quoted a senior official of Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But before that he would ask for a public vote after resolving
pending issues, Hiromu Nonaka, LDP acting secretary general, told
Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
The next general election is not mandated until next July, but
Hashimoto faces growing pressure from some fellow party members
for a snap election.
</P>
<P>
LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato said Saturday that Hashimoto
is expected to make a decision in mid-September on whether to call
an early general election.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota's reaction to the outcome of the
September 8 local referendum on whether to support a cut in the
U.S. military presence on the southernmost island prefecture and
economic data to be released in mid-September are factors which
will influence Hashimoto's decision, Kato said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama took a
cautious view about calling an early general election, saying to
serve his term until next July is his duty.
</P>
<P>
There are lingering speculation that Hashimoto would dissolve
the House of Representatives almost as soon as it reconvenes in
early October for a snap poll in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, a general election must be held within
40 days of a lower house dissolution.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Receives 2nd Consignment of US Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today received the
second consignment of US weapons which had been ordered at the end
of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The equipment included night vision modification kits, long
range howitzer guns, latest radar to locate artillery positions at
night, rockets, anti-tank Tow 2 launchers, PC-3 Orions
helicopters, anti-submarine aircraft, Harpoon missiles, torpedoes
as well as engines and kits for F-16s.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had ordered military equipment worth several billion
US dollars from the United States in the late 1980s and paid the
earnest money.
</P>
<P>
However, these equipment were embargoed by the US in 1990 when
the Pressler Amendment came into effect, which stopped all kinds
of military assistance to Pakistan, who had been accused by the US
of developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Under the Brown Amendment, which passed early this year,
Pakistan will receive nearly 370 million dollars worth of the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan received the first consignment of the equipment in
early August.

<HEADLINE> PA to Continue Objection to Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) decided today to insist on its opposition to expansion of the
Jewish settlement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the
limitation of Palestinian activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which was made today at a joint meeting of the
Palestinian Council (PC) and the PLO executive committee held in
the West Bank city of Nablus, called on the Arab world and the
international community to support the Palestinian stand.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, PA President Yasser Arafat praised Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for his support for the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mubarak had reportedly held telephone conversation
separately with both Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, and discussed the situation in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
On the dispute between the Palestinians and Israelis, Arafat
said that the meetings this week between senior PA and Israeli
officials had produced no results, and were simply attempts by
Israel to defuse Palestinian anger.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been escalating between the Palestinians and
Israel, as a result of the Israeli government's decision to permit
building of new apartments in Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Israeli security forces imposed a stricter closure
on the Palestinian autonomous areas, and prevented massive Friday
prayers called on by Arafat to protest Israeli government's
policies.
</P>
<P>
Only over 10,000 Palestinian Moslem worshipers, one third of
the regular number, made their way to arrive for the Friday
prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the old city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinians were turned back by Israeli army and
police at the checkpoints at the entrance to Jerusalem, and were
unable to participate in the prayers in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
That was the second part of a series of protests appealed by
Arafat following Thursday's 4-hour general strike, the first time
in two years, observed by the Palestinians in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Following Friday's prayers, PA strongly condemned the Israeli
government for imposing a tightened siege around Jerusalem, which
had prevented a high turnout for Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by its Information Ministry, the PA
stressed that the Israeli government's action "proves that the
extremist Netanyahu government is determined to blow up the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that the continuation of such actions
"will push toward the cycle of violence and sabotage the peace
process," adding that "the Palestinian people will not alone pay
the bill for impairing the peace process, and will not stand
motionless before such cruel measures."
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the international community "to
intervene with the Israeli government policy for the sake of
implementing all agreements concluded between Israel and the
PA, and to (make the Jewish state) desist the policy of
procrastination."

<HEADLINE> Greek Foreign Minister Visits Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Panagalos left here for Albania today on a two-day visit during
which he is expected to meet his Albanian counterpart, Tritan
Shehu, and President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the southern Albanian city of
Gjirokaster where he and Shehu inaugurated the new offices of the
Greek general consulate, Pangalos said Greek-Albanian relations
were off to "a brilliant future."
</P>
<P>
"The period of suspicion between the countries is over" and
"relations are now off to a brilliant future," an Athens News
Agency dispatch from Albania quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said the conditions which caused mistrust between the
two peoples were eliminated "and therefore suspicion has no place
any more."
</P>
<P>
Greek-Albanian relations could "develop in depth, expanding in
the fields of defense, infrastructure, and business," he said,
adding that relations between the two countries should set an
example for the other Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
In earlier statements made upon his arrival, Pangalos referred
to the issue of Albanian immigrants to Greece, saying that after
next month's elections, the Greek parliament is expected to pass
legislation providing legal status to 30 percent of all illegal
Albanians in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed however that Greece will not allow the
"uncontrollable entry of illegal immigrants to Greece." Greece's
policy on the issue of visas was harmonized with European Union
legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos is scheduled to meet with Berisha later today and the
discussion will be focused on Greek-Albanian relations, the
situation in the Balkans and international political developments.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel Aircraft Industries
(IAI) has won a tender to supply two of its Astra SPX mid-size
jets to an American company, to be refitted for the U.S. Air
National Guard, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
IAI officials were quoted as saying that the IAI company will
be transferring the jets to Tracer Flight Systems, which was
awarded a 20.8-million-U.S. dollar contract to supply a
replacement for the C-21A, also known as the Lear 35A.
</P>
<P>
The jets will be equipped with modified avionics and upgraded
engines before they are delivered to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The IAI officials said the company has an option to supply two
more Astra jets, each sold for about 7.5 million dollars, and this
could possibly lead to the sale of 40 more.
</P>
<P>
The Astra SPX was given FAA certification in January and
is now being flown in the United States, Canada and South America,
and the plane has a range of 3,000 nautical miles.

<HEADLINE> Freedom Front Plans To Set Up Afrikaner State in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An area between the Orange
River and the Cape West Coast has been identified by South
Africa's Freedom Front (FF) as the most suitable for developing a
separate Afrikaner state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria today, FF leader Constand
Viljoen said his party has already done some substantial work
towards the planning and settlement of a "'volkstaat" (white
homeland) in this area.
</P>
<P>
The area, stretching from Orania in Northern Cape to Vredendal
in Western Cape, is one of four areas recently proposed by the
Volkstaat Council for the development of an Afrikaner state.
</P>
<P>
The other three recommended are the Pretoria-Centurion area,
Bushveld area and part of Mpumalanga.
</P>
<P>
The Afrikaner population in the North and West Cape is about
17 percent of South Africa's total 41.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen stressed that the rights and interests of these large
concentrations of Afrikaners could not be ignored and needed to
be protected and enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The ideal of setting up a separate Afrikaner state within
South Africa is supported by the FF and the Volkstaat Vouncil,
while the National Party and the Conservative Party endorsed the
principle of Afrikaner self-determination.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela said last year he might consider a
separate volkstaat if the overwhelming majority of Afrikaners
support the idea, but insisting a referendum should be held
before-hand.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia today announced that it obtained a 576 million Birr
(about 90.8 million US Dollars) gross profit during the past
fiscal year, 19 percent more than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by president of the bank Tilahun
Abay at an annual review meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tilahun attributed the profit increase to the participation of
private investors in the agricultural, industrial, foreign and
domestic trade and the expansion of its loan services.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bank has extended loan services amounting to 3.3
billion Birr (about 520 million US Dollars) to business and state
enterprises as well as individuals during the past fiscal year,
of which 2.4 billion Birr (about 378 million US Dollars) was
given to the private sector of the economy while the balance to
government-owned firms and public organizations.
</P>
<P>
According to Abay, some 307.8 million Birr (about 48.5 million
US Dollars) was loaned to the agricultural sector and peasant
associations with a view to helping the country achieve its goal
of food self-sufficiency while 212.4 million Birr (about 33.5
million US Dollars) was spent on the purchase of fertilizers.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A large number of Greek students
go abroad to study due to lack of universities and colleges in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the country's research
center, approximately 29,000 Greek students study abroad each
year, with most studying in Great Britain, Italy, the United
States, France and Romania. In addition, Greek students are also
choosing to study in other countries such as China, Brazil, India
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
All in all, Greeks are studying in 43 countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
However, the numbers of young Greeks studying abroad has been
declining steadily in the last few years. In 1990, 32,068 students
were studying abroad, while last year that figure stood at 28,696.
</P>
<P>
The decline is mostly owed to the increase of private schools
and institutes for professional training in Greece and cooperation
between Greek institutions and colleges with foreign universities.

<HEADLINE> ANC Vows to Combat Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) of South Africa today vowed to redouble its
efforts to combat rampant crime in the country while national and
provincial leaders met to co-ordinate security-related
strategies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a two-day anti-crime meeting in Cape Town, South
African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said one of
the government's greatest challenges and an urgent political
priority for the ANC is to reduce crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
"As government and the ANC, we must mobilize the popular
sentiment about crime which is currently running high. We need to
be able to direct it into legitimate and effective channels and
provide political leadership," said Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
Crime is going to be one of the biggest issues in the 1999
general elections, said Mufamadi, therefore, the ANC needs to
provide clear leadership in the government's anti-crime drive
towards co-ordinating strategies between the interested parties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the government's recently released National Crime
Prevention Strategy (NCPS), Mufamadi said although appropriate
party structures have played a leading role in the formulation
and approval of the NCPS, "the ANC as the leading political
formation has a crucial role to play in leading the mobilization
of civil society towards crime reduction."
</P>
<P>
He said it is vital that the ANC develops a more integrated
and uniform approach within its structures.

PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A posthumous marriage ceremony was

About 100 people, including the parents of the dead, police

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Attacks Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 31 (Xinhua) -- In a scathing attack at
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, Lebanese House Speaker
Nabih Berri warned today against a capitalization of the
resistance against Israel in south Lebanon at the cost of this
country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in the southern Lebanese port city of Sour,
the Shiite house speaker, who is also the head of Amal Movement,
said that "the resistance is for the sake of Lebanon and we never
accept the resistance at the cost of Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the resistance is "a weapon for Lebanon's
peace, not a weapon for assassinating Lebanon's peace and
threatening Syria."
</P>
<P>
The rally was held to mark the 18th anniversary of a
mysterious disappearance of Imam Moussa As-Sadr, the founder of
the Shiite moderate Amal Movement, or Movement of Hope.
</P>
<P>
Sadr, an Iran-born cleric, who promoted the political
consciousness of Lebanon's Shiite rank and file in the course of
1970s, disappeared during a tour to Libya.
</P>
<P>
"The resistance is not a Shiite resistance, not an Islamic
resistance, not the south's resistance. The winning resistance is
one of Lebanon, all Lebanon," Berri, the successor of Imam Sadr,
underlined.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the existence of displaced people in every family on
those responsible for drawing Israel's repeated military strikes
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We wonder why there are displaced and expatriated people in
every house. Is the unemployment the reason? Is it because that
the south is left without defense?" the house speaker asked.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning a specific name, Berri said, "so they
are against you, against every one of you and against the
expansion of your choices to increase your work power and
your production and they want us to live in the desperation
and vacancy."
</P>
<P>
Berri's Amal movement and its main Shiite rival Hezbollah have
failed to map out a joint list of candidates to run for the
parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Hot competitions are expected between them in South Lebanon
and the Beqaa where the forth and fifth of a five-phase election
are respectively scheduled to be held on September 8 and 15.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the failure, the house speaker said, "you will see a
number of lists with a lot of names, but the result will be one."
</P>
<P>
As the last showdown is approaching, Hezbollah is facing
escalating rhetoric attacks from an anti-Islamic coalition led by
Berri, Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and Druze leader Waid
Jumblatt.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Hezbollah has lost one parliamentary seat
after its candidate, incumbent Deputy Ali Amar, was defeated in
the first round of election in Mount Lebanon on August 18.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers anticipated that Hezbollah's eight
seats in the current parliament, which was elected in 1992, would
be considerably reduced as a result of the election this year.
</P>
<P>
Like the previous one, the next 128-seat and
half-Christian-half-Moslem house is still be based on a
confessional system, or in other words, a system in which the
seats are distributed to various religious and sectarian
communities at a fixed rate.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government will
continue to support researches on artificial propagation of fish
to benefit fish farmers for their food and for commercial
purposes, said Kenyan Deputy Director of Fisheries Booker Oduor.
</P>
<P>
Booker Oduor said that Kenya's future fish requirements will
only be met through fish farming, because the country's fish
resources have been exploited to the maximum.
</P>
<P>
Oduor made the remarks on Friday while closing a five-day
workshop which was held at Sagana Fish Farm and attended by
district fishery officers from central and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said fish needed for the country has risen to 100,000 tons
a year while fish in lakes and rivers has been exploited to the
maximum.
</P>
<P>
The officers to the workshop stressed the need to make
concerted efforts in researches to make local species more
productive and available to farmers under the integrated fish
farming approach.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Troops Attack Kurdish Faction in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi troops today launched
attacks on a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq with heavy gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz confirmed in a statement
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) that the Iraqi
forces staged the "limited operation" at the request by the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
The KDP is battling another Kurdish faction named the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) for supremacy in the mountainous region
where the U.S.-led coalition forces established an enclave after
the 1991 Gulf war for the Kurdish people seeking independence from
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops into
Kurdistan after the KDP leader Massoud Barzani asked him to
intervene on August 22.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to launch a limited military operation in defense
of our sovereignty and our people and their properties," INA
quoted the deputy Prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Iraqi forces, allied with the KDP, had by
Saturday night captured most parts of Irbil, one of Kurdistan's
main cities.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House is closely monitoring and
evaluating the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. military to get
ready for possible deployment in the Persian Gulf in case Iraqi
troops cross into the Kurdish "no fly" zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton, who is
campaigning in the small Illinois town of Cairo, "has ordered that
steps be taken to ensure the United States is prepared for any
contingency."
</P>
<P>
"The United States is monitoring very closely indications that
Iraqi military units near Irbil, in northern Iraq, have been
brought into position and levels of readiness that would enable
them to take offensive action," McCurry said in a written
statement. "We have made clear to Iraq the seriousness with which
we view this situation."
</P>
<P>
Administration officials described the latest massing of
Iraqi troops as "provocative" and "saber-rattling" and a senior
U.S. official said the United States had been communicating its
concern over the situation over the past several weeks, mainly
through diplomats at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
KDP and its rival PUK began fighting in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister to Visit Egypt Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy will arrive in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria
Sunday to hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his
counterpart Amr Moussa on the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which come amid escalated tensions between Israel
and the Palestinians, are expected to focus on pushing forward
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy will be trying to alleviate Egypt's frustration over the
stalemate of the peace process during his one-day visit to Egypt,
the first one since he took office in June.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which has acted as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli talks,
especially in negotiations between the Palestinians and the
Jewish state, threatened on August 22 to cancel a regional
economic summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that many countries will not participate in the
conference unless progress is made in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to Mubarak's
strong message on the same day, saying that Israeli-Palestinian
talks were advancing.
</P>
<P>
However, tension has mounted between the two sides since
Thursday when Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat called
for a four-hour general strike in the West Bank, Gaza and East
Jerusalem in protest of Israel's decision to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and its demolition of a
Palestinian building in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As another showdown with Israel, Arafat also appealed to
Palestinians to head Friday toward Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque in
protest.
</P>
<P>
Arafat warned that another bloody revolt can be stirred (by
Palestinians) if Israel does not move faster to make peace.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier, apparently trying to soothe the angry
Palestinians, dispatched senior advisors to meet with Arafat and
his representatives.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat said today that these meetings did not bear
any fruit.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Kohl to Reaffirm Commitment to EMU, Bosnia Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will have an informal meeting
Sunday in Bonn, against a background of heavy doubt in France over
its capability to enter the European Monetary Union (EMU) on time.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Kohl are expected to reaffirm their commitment to
the EMU, and discuss a wide range of issues including Chechnya,
Russia and former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the criteria set by the European Union for
admission into the EMU, France is adopting an austerity budget
plan to lower its public deficit to 3 percent of the gross
national product (GNP), and has refused to drastically lower
interest rates to maintain a strong franc.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said this week that France must meet the expiry date of
January 1, 1999, to enter the EMU, because this is in the
interests of the French people to have the unified monetary unit
-- euro.
</P>
<P>
The German government Friday echoed the statement made by
Chirac by announcing a plan to lower its public deficit to 3
percent of the GNP in 1997 to meet the EU criteria for joining the
EMU.
</P>
<P>
Six days before Kohl is to pay a visit to Russia and 10 days
before Chirac is to visit Poland, the two leaders are also
expected to discuss the situation in Chechnya, Russia and Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
On former Yugoslavia, the two leaders are expected to focus on
the replacement of the peace Implementation Force (IFOR) by a new
NATO force in 1997, when the former ends its mandate.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Bonn, a German ruling coalition
official today suggested that the French-German brigade in the
Eurocorps join a new NATO mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Christian Schmidt, an official in charge of defense issues in
the ruling Christian-Socialist Union, said that this could be an
important "signal of the capacity of Europe for future action" and
"the symbol of a special force."
</P>
<P>
The NATO defense ministers will discuss the replacement of the
IFOR on September 25-26 in Bergen, Norway.

GUANGZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's longest double-body
aluminium alloy passenger ship was launched today in Panyu, and
will play an active role in promoting exchanges between Hong Kong
and China's other inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed luxury ship was manufactured by a ship-making
company owned by Hong Kong businessman Henry Fok Ying-tung.
</P>
<P>
The ship is 42 m long and 12 m wide, and can travel at a speed
of over 47 knots per hour. It is able to carry 380 passengers.
</P>
<P>
China has been relying on the import of aluminium alloy
passenger ships. Tests by the China Classification Society show
that the quality of the new domestic-made ship compares favorably
with similar vessels in the world.
</P>
<P>
Panyu is expected to become one of the country's major bases to
produce high-speed aluminium alloy passenger ships.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Closely Follows Situation in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Interior Minister
Mehmet Agar said today that Turkey is closely following the
latest developments of the incidents in northern Iraq, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported from Diyarbakir,
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Agar as saying that "we can do necessities
for the settlement to the incidents which are continuing in
Irbil, Sulaymaniya and other areas (in northern Iraq) through a
peaceful way in the framework of the Iraqi territorial
integrity. We can take all kinds of measures for this matter."
</P>
<P>
The interior minister came to Diyarbakir to attend a meeting on
the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister earlier
today called on all the parties concerned in northern Iraq to
solve the problems through dialogue, not through fighting.
</P>
<P>
She also called on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw
his troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In its biggest offensive in five years, Iraq sent tanks,
troops and helicopters Saturday to capture Irbil, the largest
city controlled by the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it launched the attack because the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) had been "cooperating" with Iran. The state-run
Iraqi News Agency said that the PUK's rival the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) supported the mission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has pledged to withdraw its troops to their previous
positions soon.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish area in northern Iraq has been policed by U.S.-led
forces since the end of the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, a 3.5-million-member ethnic minority in Iraq, are
seeking independence from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Western countries set up a safe area in northern Iraq,
including a ban on Iraqi military flights, after the KDP and
PUK joined forces in a 1991 rebellion. The groups turned on
each other after the enclave was established.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Stresses Link between Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa today reiterated Egypt's stand that the
success of a regional economic conference is linked to progress
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit to
be held in Cairo in November, Moussa said, "our position
continues as expressed by President (Hosni) Mubarak a week ago
in Alexandria."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, frustrated by the current stalemate in Arab-Israeli
peace talks, said last month that Egypt may cancel the summit if
there is still no progress in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, following a meeting between Mubarak and visiting
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, said that it would be
unimaginable to talk about regional economic cooperation if the
peace process is hindered.
</P>
<P>
Moussa attended the meeting between Mubarak and Levy, who
arrived here earlier today on his first visit to Egypt since he
took office in June.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Levy following the meeting,
Moussa said the talks dealt with the stalled Mideast peace
process, particularly the Palestinian-Israeli talks, as well as
the regional economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Levy, whose brief visit came amid escalated tension between
Israel and the Palestinians, told reporters that Israel would not
 confiscate Palestinian lands and build new settlements though
the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements do not ban the building
of settlements.
</P>
<P>
Obviously trying to soothe the Arabs' anger over Israel's
hardline policy on Arab-Israeli peace talks, Levy said that
Israel wants to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have no wish or no will to be in a standstill in the
talks," Levy said through an interpretor. "Both we and the
Palestinians have an interest in advancing the (peace) process."
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel did not violate the Oslo agreements
signed between Israel and the Palestinians with regard to the
issue of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to emphasize that in the Oslo agreements there is no
banning of settlements, in an unequivocal way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we do not confiscate land and we do not build
new settlements," he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy's statements are clearly contrary to Palestinians'
charges that Israel has broken the Palestinian-Israeli
agreements by allowing expansion of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, in somewhat a challenge to Levy's remarks, described
the building of settlements as a very serious mistake and a hard
blow on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israel would not confiscate more
Palestinian lands as Levy promised.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take note of what the (Israeli foreign) minister
just said, that is, Israel is not going to confiscate any more
land ... if so, this constitutes a distinct progress along the
peace route," Moussa said in English.
</P>
<P>
Tension has mounted between the Palestinians and Israel since
Thursday when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called a
four-hour general strike in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east
Jerusalem in protest against Israel's decision to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and demolition of a Palestinian
building in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In another showdown with Israel, Arafat also asked
Palestinians to come to a Friday prayer in east Jerusalem's Al
Aqsa Mosque as a protest against Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Arafat warned that Palestinians could be pushed toward
another bloody revolt if Israel does not move faster to make
peace.

About his over-sized cabinet, or the Council of Ministers,
which earlier had attracted criticism from even some leaders of
his main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party, Deuba said the cabinet
is quite big but it has helped maintain political stability.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers has been constituted on the basis of
the structure of the present parliament, he said,
</P>
<P>
Nepal's coalition government was formed last September after
the NC party joined hands with two small parties overthrowing the
minority Communist government through a non-confidence motion in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Deuba has expanded his cabinet for three times since then to
include a total of 47 members in the Council of Ministers with a
view to securing majority support in the parliament for the
three-party ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> Paper Carries Chinese New Ad of Protest Against NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The New York Times today
carried a new advertisement of Chinese living in the U.S. and
Canada which protests NBC for its offending comments on China and
its athletes during the past Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Costas poisoned Olympic spirit, public protests NBC,"
the ad says "We strongly protest the irresponsible remarks made by
Mr. Bob Costas of NBC regarding international athletes, including
members of the Chinese team, during the Olympic coverage.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Costas's frequent and incendiary comments on alleged drug
use by foreign athletes were unprofessional and biased. The
Olympics are no place for prejudice."
</P>
<P>
It says that Costas should have the "courage and decency" to
issue a sincere and public apology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese groups, more than 80 in all, also released a press
release today, explaining the protest campaign and the purpose of
the new advertisement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese put on an ad of protest on the Washington Post
August 14. NBC sent a brief letter of apology signed by Ed Markey,
the vice-president of NBC Sports Press, to the representative of
the protest committee.
</P>
<P>
Costas appeared in an interview with "Tonight Show" aired on
NBC on August 29. However, he said that his remarks on China's
human rights condition and alleged drug use during the Olympic
coverage were not only "factual" but also "pertinent". The letter
sent by NBC merely served as "a well-intended move," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks ignited new indignation among the protestors.
</P>
<P>
The press release said "Mr. Costas's frequent and inflammatory
allegations of drug use by Chinese athletes were nothing more than
bold speculations."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Mr. Costas's continuing defiance has seriously
undermined NBC's credibility in its effort to "put the matter to
rest," and has furthermore cast a shadow over NBC as a major TV
network in sports coverage.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Work on a Yangtze river bridge
in Jiangyin of southern Jiangsu Province, east China, is being
speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The bridge's largest attraction is that it uses a total of
100,000 km of cable, 2.5 times the girth of the earth, giving the
bridge the name, "First Wire Bridge in China".
</P>
<P>
International bidding for the upper structure of the bridge
will close at the end of this month. Construction work on the
bridge began in August, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The six-lane bridge has a total length of 3,071 meters, and is
designed for a designed speed of 100 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
Costs for the project have reached 490 million yuan. It total
investment is estimated at 3.37 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China now has nine bridges over the 5,800-km-long Yangtze
River, and two more are under construction, including the Jiangyin
bridge. Another four bridges have been approved, and preparations
for their construction are under way.

<HEADLINE> South China City Reports Rapid Growth in Electronics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Huizhou City in south
China's Guangdong Province has developed an electronics sector
that went from an industrial value of 14 million yuan in 1985 to
11.2 billion yuan last year, accounting for 35.6 percent of the
city's total output.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the city's economic take-off could not have taken
place without the development of electronics over the past few
years, putting it behind only Shenzhen in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), electronics had
an annual growth rate of 57.9 percent, making Huizhou's industrial
increase double the province's average.
</P>
<P>
The city government is taking various measures to support the
the pillar industry to sharpen its competitive edge in both
domestic and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Huizhou's electronics businesses are being encouraged to create
their own brands, instead of being gobbled up by better-known
groups. The TCL Group, for example, refused an offer from a
company of the Republic of Korea to produce the company's brand of
TV. Instead, the TCL trademark has become worth 460 million yuan.

</P>
<P>
More than 2,600 delegates from 140 countries or areas are

whose theme reads "Archives by the end of the century: taking
stock and looking ahead".
</P>
<P>
The congress, the general assembly of the International Council

archivists meeting under the auspice of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and officially
established in Paris, in August, 1950.
</P>
<P>
Its prime aim is to encourage and support, in cooperation with
other international governmental or non-governmental organizations
and agencies, the development of archives preservation and
management.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Strives to Alleviate Poverty (by Cai Guozhong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua)-- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has in recent years reiterated the determination of his
administration to alleviate poverty in the country, which is the
14th poorest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Thus, a campaign aiming at alleviating poverty has been
carried out in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
In general, the major indicators of poverty in Uganda are as
following: life expectance has gone down from 50 years in the
late l960s and the early 1970s to less than 43 years at present
and the rate of those regarded as poorers in Uganda has increased
to 60 percent of its total population from less than 50 percent
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the national population are now living
below the poverty line in Uganda, that is the 100 US Dollars
per-capita expenditure per annum.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a significant proportion of the population
which has faired better than before. The economy has improved
dramatically within the last 5-6 years, due to prevailing peace
and stability across the country. The cost of living has remained
stable over the last two years, and availability of goods and
services has improved as a result of the economic reform program
carried out nine years ago in the country.
</P>
<P>
The major causes of poverty in Uganda are civil strife,
difficulties for farmers to access markets and get loans. Others
are lack of chances of education and employment.
</P>
<P>
In order to handle these causes, the current government has
paid much attention to political and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
After free and fair general elections from April to June this
year, the country's leadership has finally settled and now the
central government is spending much energy to quell insurgency in
northern districts of Gulu and Kitgum, so that a peaceful
atmosphere will be created for the campaign against poverty.
</P>
<P>
On the economic fields, the government has maintained macro
economic stability by taking strict measures such as controlling
the increase of inflation rate under seven percent per ammun and
rationalising its public expenditure allocation to benefit the
social sector.
</P>
<P>
In order to help poor farmers in the country, the government
has done some basic work in the sphere of infrastructure. Since
1986 when the current government came to power, a 57,400 km long
highway network has been rehabilitated in the country. This
represents about 65 percent of the country's 88,320 km of road
network.
</P>
<P>
And during the presidential campaign last May President
Museveni promised to supply for all the 39 districts'
administrations a set of road construction equipment each in a
bid to make them convenient to build feeder roads for farmers to
access urban markets.
</P>
<P>
What is more, at Kapchorwa, eastern Uganda, on March 23, 1995,
President Museveni officially launched a credit scheme called
"entandikwa" in local Luganda language, meaning a loan to help
poor farmers to start a business.
</P>
<P>
The first Entandikwa credit scheme funding of 6.42 billion
Shillings (6.42 million US dollars) was allocated in the 1994/95
financial year.
</P>
<P>
As for education, the president promised the parents of
students in May this year that four children in each Ugandan
family will enjoy free education of primary school from next
year since the country's revenue has increased rapidly in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
On employment, the government has since 1991 established the
Uganda investment authority to attract investment, as a means of
creating jobs for the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The authority has since 1991 issued 1,523 licenses to new
enterprises which will create 88,526 jobs for urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
With the above measures taken by the government, analysts here
believe that poverty prevailing across the country can be
alleviated. However, it is not possible to eradicate poverty
completely in the country, because even developed countries now
have poor people. enditem

<TEXT>

<P>
FUZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Primary and middle schools in a
flood-stricken area in southeast China's Fujian Province started
their fall semester on time today, thanks to the efforts of the
local government.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jansher Khan Beaten in Hong Kong Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- World's top-ranked squash
player Jansher Khan of Pakistan had his dream of an eighth Hong
Kong Open win shattered as he was beaten by Australian Rodney
Eyles in straight games in the final of the Cathay Pacific Open
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Though dominating world squash since joining the professional
circuit nine years ago and a top favorite for the title, the
27-year-old Pakistani only managed to obtain a short-lived 10-9
lead in the opening game today.
</P>
<P>
Khan seemed shaky and uncertain, especially after losing the
first two games with an identical score of 15-10 in the hands of
the second-ranked Australian.
</P>
<P>
With a fierce, attacking play, Eyles gradually took an upper
hand over Khan in the final and the third game seemed even easier
as he won it 15-5.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few players who can beat him (Khan). They just
have to believe themselves," said Eyles earlier in the Hong Kong
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to win this tournament and I find it hard to
describe how I feel now," he said, after receiving the 87,500 Hong
Kong dollars (11,000 U.S. dollars) top prize today.
</P>
<P>
Jansher first came to notice in 1986 when he won the World
Junior title by beating Eyles. He achieved his greatest ambition
of winning the World Open seven times in 1995 and beating the
previous record of his compatriot Jahangir Khan.
</P>
<P>
Jansher has lost only five times since the start of 1992. He is
widely taken as the greatest player the sport has ever produced.
</P>
<P>
Eyles has been known as the fastest player of the circuit,
especially after he scored a come-from-behind win over Jansher in
a 101-minute marathon semi-finals in the 1983 Portuguese Open.
</P>
<P>
Besides squash, boxing and tennis are the other sporting
passions for Eyles.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Law Breakers Being Turned in By Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Procuratorates in east China's
Anhui province have received more than 110,000 tips from various
people over the past eight years in the fight against
illegalities, especially economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of report centers eight years ago, more
than 20,000 cases have been investigated or prosecuted, and 290
million yuan (34.9 million US dollars) in state losses recovered.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the provincial procuratorate promulgated regulations
on the protection on rights and interests of informants to
encourage the reporting of crimes.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments have set up special funds for those
providing special information, and since 1995, a total of 220,000
yuan has been used to award 44 informants for valuable tips.
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement departments have also worked hard to handle
reports in order to encourage greater compliance by citizens.
</P>
<P>
Most people whose actions were reported were charged with
embezzlement and taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the citizens' reports, procuratorates across the
province dealt with 18,197 cases of embezzlement and bribery
between January of last year and July of this year. The figure
accounted for 76.3 percent of all cases handled by the offices.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, 42 officials at or above the
county level who were found guilty of economic crimes had been
penalized.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHENZHEN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A passenger train left here
this afternoon for Beijing, marking the opening of the
2,536-kilometer Beijing-Kowloon Railway.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, which borders Hong kong, is a major transport hub on
the new 40-billion yuan railway.
</P>
<P>
The new line is expected to ease transport pressures between
north and south China, help maintain stability and prosperity in
Hong Kong and Macao, push forward China's reunification, and
further open China to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
At an opening ceremony for the railway, Vice-Minister of
Railways Sun Yongfu said that the new line will provide a reliable
guarantee for the transport of Hong Kong's imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
The nine province-level areas along the line will offer a "vast
investment area" for business people in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are underway to provide direct express passenger
train services between Beijing and Kowloon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Passenger trains can hit speeds of 60 km per hour on the new
railway. Travel time for a passenger train from Beijing to
Shenzhen is 48 hours and will be shortened to 38 hours next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China has
worked out new ways of increasing people's awareness of the law
over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province helped 33.5 million
people get a better understanding of the Constitution and other
laws, and some 14.2 million took part in law quizzes, with 90
percent of them passing.
</P>
<P>
In this way, law-enforcement personnel are better able to do
their work in accordance with law, and citizens tend to conduct
their daily affairs with law in mind and to take a more active
part in political affairs, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of state laws, local codes and rules and
regulations, the province plans to set up a legal system which
will promote political and social progress and the development of
a socialist market economy by the end of the century.

<P>
RANGOON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A joint Japanese-Myanmar team
has made good progress on an attempt to be the first climbers to
scale Khakaborazi mountain, the highest in Myanmar, a report said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese climber Takashi Ozaki and members of the Myanmar
Hiking and Mountaineering Association began their assault on the
5,847-meter high snowcapped mountain July 25, leaving in two
groups from Putao, the nearest town 100 kilometers from the
mountain and 1,150 kilometers north of Rangoon.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by local guides, one group had made it 5,480 meters
up the slope by last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second attempt by the 43-year-old Ozaki and his
Myanmar colleagues to conquer the mountain in Putao township in
Kachin state.
</P>
<P>
In July last year they abandoned their first attempt at the
4,750 meters due to severe weather and ice cracking.

URUMQI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Products from more than 40
countries and regions will be on display at the fifth annual
Urumqi Economic and Trade Fair, which opened today in the capital
city of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The first Urumqi fair, held in northwest China in 1992, was
proposed by Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
During the previous fairs, business volume with overseas
exhibitors reached 6.9 billion US dollars; the amount among
Chinese business people hit 13.5 billion yuan (about 1.6 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This year's fair has 856 exhibition booths and attracts over
2,000 foreign and 10,000 Chinese businessmen.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest of the five fairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo proclaimed the event's opening
at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Abul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the
people's government of Xinjiang, delivered a welcome speech to
participants.
</P>
<P>
The fair is held in connection with the central government's
decision to shift the focus of the country's economic development
from east China to the middle and western areas.

Since last year, the state has carried out preferential
policies to boost the development of resource and infrastructure
industries in central and western China.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM: Israel Not to Build New Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy said in this port city today that Israel
would not confiscate Palestinian lands or build new settlements
though the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements do not ban the
building of settlements.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who arrived here earlier today on his first visit to
Egypt since he took office in June, made the remarks following
his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which came amid escalated tension between Israel
and the Palestinians, were focused on Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Obviously trying to soothe the Arabs' anger over Israel's
hardline policy on Arab-Israeli peace talks, Levy said that
Israel wants to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have no wish or no will to be in a standstill in the
talks," Levy said through an interpretor. "Both we and the
Palestinians have an interest in advancing the (peace) process."
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Egyptian counterpart Amr
Moussa, Levy said that Israel did not violate the Oslo agreements
signed between Israel and the Palestinians with regard to the
issue of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to emphasize that in the Oslo agreements there is no
banning of settlements, in an unequivocal way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we do not confiscate land and we do not build
new settlements," he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy's statements are clearly contrary to Palestinians'
charges that Israel has broken the Palestinian-Israeli
agreements by allowing expansion of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who first held talks with Levy and then attended the
Levy-Mubarak talks today, described the building of settlements
as a very serious mistake and a hard blow on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israel would not confiscate more
Palestinian lands as Levy promised.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take note of what the (Israeli foreign) minister
just said, that is, Israel is not going to confiscate any more
land ... if so, this constitutes a distinct progress along the
peace route," Moussa said in English.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Moussa and Mubarak, Levy also discussed
with the Egyptian leaders a regional economic conference to be
held in Cairo on November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, who has acted as a mediator in Arab-Israeli peace
talks, has been frustrated over the stalemate of the peace
process. It has threatened to cancel the third Middle East and
North Africa Economic Summit if there is still no progress in
the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon reacted to
Mubarak's strong message, reassuring that Israeli-Palestinian
talks were advancing and the summit could be held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
However, tension has mounted between the two sides since
Thursday when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called a
four-hour general strike in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east
Jerusalem in protest against Israel's decision to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and demolition of a Palestinian
building in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In another showdown with Israel, Arafat also asked
Palestinians to come to a Friday prayer in east Jerusalem's Al
Aqsa Mosque as a protest against Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Arafat warned that Palestinians could be pushed toward
another bloody revolt if Israel does not move faster to make
peace.

<HEADLINE> Equatorial Guinean President Confers with Chinese Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Equatorial Guinean
President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo today invited Chinese
entrepreneurs to carry out economic cooperation in his country,
saying the Equatorial Guinean government will strongly support
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Obiang held talks today with more than 50 enterpreneurs from
over 10 Chinese companies at the Diaoyutai state guest house. He
said the talks were significant in that this is the first time he
has met with Chinese enterpreneurs during his three visits to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said that Equatorial Guinea is rich in oil, mineral, forest
and fisheries resources, and Chinese enterpreneurs are welcome to
invest there, take part in market competition, and cooperate with
their Equatorial Guinean counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He believes that such cooperation will allow China to benefit
from the natural resources of Equatorial Guinea, and also
introduce new technology to his country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Liu Shanzai, who attended the talks, said that the two countries
have worked together successfully in fields of passenger and cargo
transportation on water, in radio and telecommunications, and in
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Their cooperation presently extends to new areas, such as
forestry and raising poultry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that the two countries are complementary in terms of
economy and trade, and that their mutual development potential is
broad. He said he is confident that cooperation between the two
nations will advance to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese enterpreneurs attending the talks said they are
willing to cooperate with Equatorial Guinea in various areas, and
to contribute more to the country's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Obiang arrived here Saturday on an eight-day state visit to
China, at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang will hold a welcoming ceremony in honor of Obiang on
Monday, to be followed by talks between the two sides.

</P>
<P>
By the end of August 31, the 13th day for the distribution of

<HEADLINE> Egypt Follows Situation in Iraq with Great Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, September l (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said today that Egypt is following with great
concern the incidents taking place in Iraq, and that it hopes
the blood of Iraqis -- including Arab and Kurdish ones -- will
be spared.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks in a press statement in the Egyptian
port city of Alexandria, 230 kilometers north of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt underlines the necessity of respecting the sovereignty
of Iraq over all its territory," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
In its biggest offensive in five years, Iraq sent tanks,
troops and helicopters Saturday to capture Irbil, the largest
city controlled by the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it launched the attack because the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK) had been "cooperating" with Iran. The
state-run Iraqi News Agency said the PUK's rival the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) supported the mission.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has pledged to withdraw its forces to their previous
positions soon.
</P>
<P>
Western countries' reactions this time are rather
ambiguous. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he had ordered
U.S. forces in the Gulf to be placed on "high alert," and "they
are now being reinforced."
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish area in northern Iraq has been policed by U.S.-led
forces since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, a 3.5-million-member ethnic minority in Iraq, are
seeking independence from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Western countries set up a safe area in northern Iraq,
including a ban on Iraqi military flights, after the KDP and PUK
joined forces in a 1991 rebellion. The two groups turned on each
other after the enclave was established.

<HEADLINE> New Life of Fisherman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Qiu Degui, a fisherman who
lives by Changdang Lake in northern Jiangsu Province, east China,
dreamed of leading a comfortable life. Now his dream has come true.
</P>
<P>
Qiu moved to Jintan from Xuzhou city after China's
nationwide liberation. Before China's reform and opening to the outside
world, his monthly income as a fisherman was only 18 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Qiu switched from fishing to raising aquatics. Now, he
has contracted to build a 3.3-ha cultivation base to be used for
raising crabs.
</P>
<P>
In his new profession, he can earn an annual net income of more
than 10,000 yuan. This year, he used scientific technology to
raise 15,000 crabs in 80-centimeter-deep water.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Qiu and his family spent ten months out of every
year living on a boat. Every two days, they went ashore to buy
fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Now, he has an apartment with more than 100 square meters
ashore, where his family lives during the winter. If this year's
crab harvest is good, Qui will buy a mobile telephone and a
speedboat.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian Shengfa, director of the Management Committee
of Changdang Lake, more than 1,200 fishermen have contracted a
total of 2,660 ha of water space to use as aquatics production
bases. They could generate a fishery output value of 45,000 yuan
per year, with a total profit of 22,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
With their earnings, the fishermen have so far bought more than
50 mobile telephones and some 120 speedboats.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Satellite Spies on Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain has secretly spent 500
million pounds (750 million U.S. dollars) on American-controlled
spy satellites which were allegedly subsequently used by
Washington to eavesdrop on a British general, The Sunday Telegraph
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Britain's contribution toward the U.S. Magnum series satellites
-- intended as a substitute for the cancelled Zircon program --
was justified by an official as "part of the way we kept up our
subscription to the U.S. country club," the report says.
</P>
<P>
The spending -- which was kept secret from some members of the
British cabinet -- is revealed in a new book, UK Eyes Alpha,
published recently by defense journalist Mark Urban.
</P>
<P>
In return for Britain's contribution to the Magnum program, the
report says, it was agreed that the British Government
Communications Headquarters (BGCH) would receive the signals
gathered from all three satellites.
</P>
<P>
"Britain would also be allowed to 'task' the satellites on
targets of interest to the United Kingdom for up to a third of the
time. They would not be delivered to Britain and would remain under
the control of the United States, their majority paymaster," it
says.
</P>
<P>
"But by the time the satellites became operational in 1994-95,
British intelligence officers thought the U.S. was using Magnum to
spy on British officers in Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the revelation in 1987 that the
British government -- undeclared to Parliament -- was funding
Zircon, a home-grown spy satellite, caused a political storm and
immense embarrassment to the then government of Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
The report recalled that former Prime Minister Thatcher's
backing for the spy satellite project showed her belief in the
Anglo-U.S. special relationship -- tempered by concern forged
during the Falklands war to ensure Britain's own "intelligence
sovereignty."

HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A few thousand people
gathered at Victoria park here this afternoon to promote the
"Sowers Action-Walk to Beijing", an effort by warm-hearted local
residents to raise fund for students in mountainous areas of
China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
With a fund-raising target of 20 million HK dollars (2.56
million US dollars), the walk will commence on February 16 next

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Convocation of International Congress on Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The 13th International
Congress on Archives that will open here tomorrow will certainly
push forward progress in the development of archives in all
countries, according to the "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to be published tomorrow, China's leading
newspaper says the congress will also have a far-reaching impact
on the protection of the world's historical and cultural
heritages, and create the new plan to advance archival work in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Scientific management and effective use of archives play a "very
important" role in speeding up economic construction, advancing
scientific and technological progress, improving the quality of
citizens and promoting social development throughout the world,
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing use of computers and other sophisticated
technology, "the traditional archives managerial model is facing a
severe challenge."
</P>
<P>
It adds that with the application of electronic documents,
microfilm files and new carrier systems for archives, archivists
will find it necessary to establish new management philosophies
and practices, adopt new or different methods, apply sophisticated
technology and modernize their archives management styles.
</P>
<P>
With the development of social civilization and the improvement
of people's awareness of archives, archives will play an
increasingly important role in society.
</P>
<P>
"All this has set higher requirements for archives work in the
new century," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses the need to develop archives and information
resources to serve civilization.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has included the archives development
project into the country's social development plan, thus ensuring
the undertaking's sustained growth, it says.
</P>
<P>
"To date, an archives system with Chinese characteristics that
is suited to China's economic and social development has taken
shape," it adds.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 2,633 archives administrative offices at
and above the county level, 3,662 archives centers at lower levels
and some one million archivists.
</P>
<P>
It praises those workers for their efforts to advance the
cultural and material progress of their field, saying such
advances will open China wider to the outside world, step up the
country's reform and accelerate its modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
It expresses the belief that the 13th International Congress on
Archives will demonstrate China's achievements in the area of
archives, and will help increase exchanges and step up cooperation
between Chinese archives workers and their colleagues in other
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has
cleared more than 190,000 goods from some 400 local shops in a
massive three-month fight against substandard and fake items.
</P>
<P>
The commodities were removed from over 2.24 million kinds of
goods in the shops, and included leather products, garments,
cloth, furniture, household electrical appliances and packed food,
which failed to meet state standards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among the commodities surveyed, 91 percent
were passable. They were: furniture, 91 percent; garments, 93
percent; leather products, 91 percent ; garment material, 96
percent; food labels, 90 percent; and packed goods, 94 percent,
according to the national Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The substandard commodities have been either returned to their
producers, or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that some commodities failed to weigh the same
as stated on the labels, and some did not have proper labels or
addresses of manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The fight, waged by the local technical inspection bureau and
the commercial commission, involved all major shops in the city's
18 counties and districts.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a nationwide anti-fake drive in 100 cities across
the country.

<HEADLINE> Weihai Attracts More Investors from Republic of Koreans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Scenic Weihai, a coastal city in
east China's Shangdong Province, has 1attracted growing numbers of
tourists from Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
And the Koreans liked the city so much that they have invested
in its future, said Zhang Jingjie, director of the local Foreign
Economic and Trade Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said over 2.1 billion US dollars of foreign investment has
been made in recent years, with 390 million US dollars coming from
the ROK, ranking second among foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The city of Weihai is also a famous summer resort, with
flourishing markets and broad avenues. The shop signboards are all
written in both Chinese and Korean. People can be heard speaking
Korean at any time in the busy markets. Many people from the
ethnic Korean group from northeast China's Jilin, Heilongjiang and
Liaoning Provinces, run restaurants, hotels and dance halls in the
city.
</P>
<P>
After the first navigation line between Weihai and Korean
Peninsula was opened, an increasing number of ROK visitors and
investors visited the city. To meet the demands of language and
communication, some schools in Weihai set up training classes so
that local residents could learn to speak Korean.
</P>
<P>
Weihai city holds a Sino-Korea Foreign Trade and Economic Fair
every year, attracting more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
It indicates that Weihai is on the road to being a new,
modernized and open city, Zhang Jingjie noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Press Industry Develops Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's press industry has seen
drastic development since the country initiated its policies of
reform and opening to the outside world 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China had only 186 newspapers, but by the end of last
year, the number jumped to more than 2,200. Also in 1978, China
had only 930 magazines in circulation; the total rose to over
8,100 by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 26.8 billion newspapers were sold, while magazine
circulation topped 2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
Economic, legal and science publications showed the strongest
growth momentum. China has more than 4,300 science magazines,
covering virtually every subject, including UFOs.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment magazines and newspapers, such as the paper
"Flowers, Birds, Fish and Insects," have carved their own niche in
the market. And eight religious publications are printed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of foreign publications have appeared in
China, and it is not uncommon to see them side by side with their
Chinese counterparts in businesses, schools, and publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
China's press also caters to its 56 nationalities; the country
has 80 newspapers and 170 magazines printed in the languages of
its minority groups.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the Chinese press, the government
has stepped up regulations and laws to oversee the industry. More
than 100 regulations are in force.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Commit 2.8 Billion Dollars for Science, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
will commit about 2.8 billion US dollars to develop science and
technology from now to the year 2000, Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong said today.
</P>
<P>
"The government recognizes the importance of technology and the
need to continue our investment in the future," Lee said in his
keynote address at the launch of Techmonth 96, an annual event to
showcase the country's achievements in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister said that the government "has drawn
up a second National Science and Technology Plan to show the way
forward for the next five years and beyond. Under the plan, the
government will commit another 4 billion Singapore dollars (about
2.8 billion US dollars at the current exchange rate) to develop
science and technology from now to the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Singapore government set aside 2 billion Singapore
dollars (about 1.42 billion US dollars at the current exchange
rate) for its first Five-Year plan for science and technology
development.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that this sum had been fully committed. "We have set
up 13 research institutes and centers, co-funded private sector
R&AMP;D initiatives and brought in foreign talent to augment the local
pool of researchers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is now doing much more R&AMP;D (Research And Development)
activity than before, he said, adding that compared to 1991,
Singapore's spending on R&AMP;D had gone up by 75 percent to reach 1.3
billion Singapore dollars (about 922 million US dollars) in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cashewnut Production Picking up In Mtwara, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"From 1974-75 national production has been on its downward
trend every year," said Mtwara Regional Administrative Secretary
Mama Mary Luwilo recently.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the sharp decline have been attributed to
diseases, insects, low prices, the ageing of trees, lack of care
for the crop after people had been moved to Ujamaa villages, bad
weather and lack of experts.
</P>
<P>
"To save the situation, the region introduced the cashew
improvement program. It was a special six-year program that
started in 1990/91 to June 30, 1996," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was jointly sponsored by the World Bank, the British and
Tanzanian governments when 25 million U.S. Dollars was set aside.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Mtwara has 86,000 hectares of land on
which some 10,679,500 cashew trees are grown.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the pogram was to increase production to
raise the income of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Other areas of improvement included deep research into the
crop, producing and distributing better seeds, to advise the
government on the markets and to supervise the availability of
fertilisers," the regional administrative secretary said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the region is concerned the program is a success,"
she said with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Mary Luwilo explained that following its implementation,
production had increaed from 15,209 tons in 1990/91 to 49,106
tons in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
She said cashew farmers were now able to sell their crop on
competitive prices and that there had been a lot of improvement
in the production and distribution of better seeds.
</P>
<P>
The regional adminstraive secretary also said that a fund for
the purchase of farm implements and other in-puts was established
in the 1994/95 season. She said the 110 million Tanzania
Shillings (about 183,000 U.S. Dollars) fund was aimed at
providing the farmers with tools and in-puts at reasonable
prices.
</P>
<P>
During the last season the fund bought and distributed to
farmers 21 tons of millet and maize, 33 tons of fertilizer, and
various insecticides.
</P>
<P>
She said that cashew farmers were being motivated to maintain
their farms properly and the district councils had drafted
by-laws to ensure the crop was developed according to acceptable
standards.
</P>
<P>
In further efforts to spread and develop the crop, seedlings
were given to farmers, she added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Russia Upsets China at World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SENDAI, Japan, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia upset China 3-1
on the last day of a World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix leg here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-13, 3-15, 15-9, 15-12 victory avenged the Russians' 3-1
loss to China in a semi-final at the Atlanta Olympic Games four
weeks ago, where China finished second and Russia third.
</P>
<P>
Russia rallied from 1-8 down to win the first set 15-13, thanks
mainly to powerful high-point smashes from Evguenia Artamonova and
18-year-old new face Elena Godina.
</P>
<P>
China made it one-all as Wu Yongmei scored six points to lead a
comeback in the second set, but saw their attacks thwarted by
effective Russian double and triple blockings in the following two
sets.
</P>
<P>
Godina scored 14 points and Artamonova had 11. Chinese captain
Lai Yawen and Wu each scored eight points.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's powerful serves restricted our fast attacks," said
Chinese coach Lang Ping. "The Chinese players are relatively
shorter and they need to consume more energy to attack."
</P>
<P>
With many young talents, Russia was a world-class squad and had
a promising future, she added.
</P>
<P>
Russia's coach Nikolai Karpol attributed their success to a new
setter.
</P>
<P>
"Today we had the best match of this tournament," he said.
"(Marina) Nikoulina, who had played as the libero player until
yesterday, became a setter and she controlled the team very well."
</P>
<P>
In the other game, Olympic gold medalist Cuba overcame
resilient Japan 15-11, 12-15, 15-8, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and Cuba all notched two victories against one
loss, but China won the leg with better set differential. Russia
placed second, Cuba third and winless Japan last.
</P>
<P>
China's Sun Yue was selected the Most Valuable Player of the
Sendai leg.
</P>
<P>
The eight-nation Grand Prix event last five weeks, with the
first four as preliminaries. The other four teams are the
Netherlands, defending champion United States, Brazil and South
Korea.

groups to play round-robin matches in two cities simultaneously
each weekend. The Sendai event ran along with a leg in Jakarta,

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A new study said the
risk of passing Hiv to babies through breast-feeding could be
higher than previously though.
</P>
<P>
New research carried out by a South Afrian Doctor, Glenda
Gray, showed breastfeeding increases the risk of passing the
virus that causes Aids from mother to child by 28 percent, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies have suggested breast-feeding increases the
rist by only 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Breast-feeding is being promoted by United Nations agencies,
including the World Health Organisation and the United Nations
Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
They say breast-feeding helps reduce infant mortality in
Africa as the milk contains anti-bobies which fight off
diseases. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iran Terms Fighting in Northern Iraq "Massacre" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities today broke
its silence over the Iraqi troops' attack on positions of
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in northern Iraq, terming it
"massacre" with a U.S. green light.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri noted that the recent
"massacre" of people in Irbil, northern Iraq, has been definitely
carried out in coordination with a green light from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first session of the Parliament after summer
recess, he said, "the United States and the Baathist regime have
deprived the Iraqi people of the right to decide their fate and
have kept them under pressure."
</P>
<P>
This is the first brief but clear reaction from the Islamic
regime in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops Saturday shelled the PUK positions around Irbil,
one of the Kurdistan's main cities, in northern Iraq, and
reportedly captured the city by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and PUK began fighting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News today carried an editorial
entitled "Northern Iraq is a Regional Concern."
</P>
<P>
It said, "Ominous movements of Iraqi forces in the north and
the flimsy allegations of the Iranian involvement in internal
fighting of Kurdish groups seem to be a prelude to another
adventurism, which is so characteristic of the ruler of Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
The paper denied any Iranian involvement in the internal
fighting in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as
saying that "Iran has been trying to have friendly relations with
both Kurdish groups and has actively promoted coexistence between
the two sides."
</P>
<P>
The paper called on regional countries, particularly Iran,
Syria and Turkey, to shoulder crucial responsibility for easing
tensions in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai Residents Marry Transients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- One out of every seven
marriages in Shanghai involves the union of a local resident and a
transient.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 42,834 couples had registered
to marry in Shanghai. Of those, 6,442 were locals marrying
transients outside the city, which constitutes more than 15
percent of the total, according to the latest statistics reported
in the local "Wenhui Daily."
</P>
<P>
In February, the marriages between locals and transients
accounted for 12.97 percent of the total. In June, the figure
soared to 17.16 percent. In Minhang district, over 20 percent of
the marriages involve transients.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that in most cases, young Shanghai men marry
transient girls.
</P>
<P>
Among the 5,208 divorced couples in the city as of the first
six months of this year, 165 couples involved transients,
accounting for less than four percent.
</P>
<P>
The transient population in Shanghai has topped three million
and the local legislature has worked out a series of regulations
on returning transients to their places of origin, and to control
those who live in the city temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Most of these outsiders are engaged in local businesses or live
in the city for only a brief period of time. The local authorities
maintain tight control over family planning restrictions that must
be followed by the transients.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Zimbabwe's Children to Be Orphaned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Close to one third of the
children in Zimbabwe may be orphaned by the year 2010 due to the
aids epidemic, according to the latest report from Southern
Africa Aids Information Dissemination Service.
</P>
<P>
The report said at least 500,000 children in the country were
expected to be orphaned by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
''This in itself could be a major long-term impediment to the
country's growth and development and the effective long-term support
of communities to take care of increasing numbers of orphaned
children should be a high priority,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the transport industry, military, commercial agriculture
and mining sectors were the most susceptible groups to the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed this to the fact that these sectors had high
risk factors such as reliance on migrant or seasonal labour, or
operation mobility.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Hardline Daily Opposed to Rafsanjani's 3rd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An Iran's hardline paper today
was openly opposed to the third term of presidency for 61-year-
old Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jumhuri Islami said in its editorial that
President Rafsanjani can not be re-elected to the office because
of explicit constitutional provisions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Jumhuri Islami is the mouthpiece of the hardliners headed by
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and has indirect support
from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The moderate camp headed by President Rafsanjani has launched
a drive to seek the third term of presidency for Rafsanjani, who
has been in office for two consecutive four-year terms.His
presidency will expire by July 1997.
</P>
<P>
But, the drive has been clearly blocked by hardliners and
extremists. The rift within the ruling regime would be widened
and finally turn into an open fight, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
The daily said Clause 114 of Iran's constitution says that
an Iranian president can be voted into office only for two
consecutive four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, this paper is in principle opposed to the
participation of Rafsanjani in the forthcoming presidential
race," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, supporters of Rafsanjani called for a nationwide
referendum on amending the constitution in a bid to seek a third
term of presidency for Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Nouri, a Parliament member from Tehran, said
"Regardless of the rightists' opposition to Rafsanjani's
candidacy for the third term ... he (Rafsanjani) should be given
another chance because of his personal charisma and rich
political and executive experiences."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the president must be allowed to run for a
third term, and an end must be put to the present uncertainty
concerning the future head of the Executive Branch.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "it is in the interest of the country and we
should not deprive our country of such a courageous statesman."
</P>
<P>
Hussein Marashi, another Parliament member from Kerman
province, supported re-election of President Rafsanjani for the
third term, saying that there are no legal hurdle obstructing the
re-election of Rafsanjani for a third term except his own
personal disinclination.
</P>
<P>
From the legal point of view, he added, the way for
Rafsanjani's re-election is wide open and "it is my personal view
that it must be done."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Summer Sees Growing Vogue for Putonghua in HK (1) (by Xu Xingtang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- "Bi Zi", eight-year-old Wong
 Xiu-tung pointed his finger at his nose and followed his
teacher's pronunciation to speak out the facial features in
Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
It was a rainy summer day, Xiu-tung and his 34 classmates, all
aged between eight and 11, gathered in a classroom of Yaumati
Catholic Primary School in Hong Kong to learn to speak Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of July 1, 1997 -- the date of Hong Kong's
handover to China -- and the constantly increasing exchanges
between Hong Kong and the mainland, more and more Hong Kong
residents have begun to show interest in learning Putonghua, and
this summer the official language of China was especially "hot" in
the territory.
</P>
<P>
Wong Yik-tsin, teacher of Xiu-tung's class, said that 140 first
 year and second year primary pupils used their summer vacation
to learn everyday-use Putonghua in the four summer-training
classes opened in the school.
</P>
<P>
This is a government-sponsored Putonghua training program
designed especially for primary and middle school students who
don't have Putonghua course in their normal curriculum. After the
20-hour introductory training, they are expected to be able to
make simple communications in Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that during the summer holidays, more
than 14,000 primary and middle school students joined the training
 classes in 83 primary schools and 47 middle schools.
</P>
<P>
"There should have been many more students in my class," Wong
said, "but we are allowed to admit no more than 35 students in
each class, so many students failed to get a seat and have to wait
 for next year's training program."
</P>
<P>
Apart from youngsters, Putonghua also attracted many
enthusiastic adults, who tried to learn Putonghua through various
channels.
</P>
<P>
Tan Siu-cheung, 45, has devoted himself in promoting Putonghua
for more than 20 years. In 1975 he sponsored Xianggang Putonghua
Yanxi She Ltd. (Putonghua Study Society), which has now become the
 most famous non-governmental Putonghua-promoting organization in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We have trained a total of 280,000 people in the past 20
years, and this summer almost 30,000 people are attending our
Putonghua courses," Tan said.
</P>
<P>
Now the society has its own teaching building and more than 300
 teachers. It has its own newspaper, periodical and a Putonghua
chorus.
</P>
<P>
"We talk in Putonghua, we sing in Putonghua, we perform in
Putonghua. To learn good Putonghua, you must create a good
circumstance," he said, adding that preparations are being made
for a Putonghua festival to be staged soon.

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Campaign Against Periodontal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Ministry of
Health has decided to carry out a nationwide survey of
periodontal disease in the country's general population in an
attempt to prevent the illness that plagues some 90 percent of
the people in Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, in a letter to the Israel Dental Association's
Journal, recommends that dentists carefully examine the gums of
all patients who come in for dental treatment, The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A recent U.S. survey showed that in Western countries, half of
those aged 18, 80 percent of those aged 35 and and 90 percent of
those over 60 suffered from varying degrees of periodontal
diseases such as bleeding, inflamed and receding gums. Untreated,
this can lead to tooth loss.
</P>
<P>
The association says that in many cases, dentists have
succeeded in controlling dental caries through preventive care and
educational efforts. Now a major challenge is fighting
periodontal disease, about which there is a much greater lack of
awareness.
</P>
<P>
Under the ministry's instructions, the Israel Periodontal
Association has set up special letter box and telephone line to
answer any question from the public about periodontal
diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tan, born and brought up in Hong Kong, began to learn Putonghua
 when he was studying in Hong Kong University in the early
1970s. He learnt it wholly by himself and now his pronunciation is
perfect.
</P>
<P>
"Don't ask when I will quit (promoting Putonghua), it's my
lifelong occupation," he said, "Putonghua has grabbed my heart and
 soul."
</P>
<P>
Presently there are over a dozen non-governmental
Putonghua-promoting organizations in Hong Kong, most of which
provide training classes in holidays or at night.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only 15 percent of Hong Kong's 6.3 million
 residents can speak Putonghua, while one out of five can
understand it.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is short of Putonghua teachers," Tan said, adding
that many teachers received training of only 60 hours before they
take the rostrum, which is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
He said that to promote Putonghua more speedily and more
efficiently, a clever method is to increase cooperative efforts
with related organizations in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Obviously this has been taken into consideration this summer,
when quite a few official and non-official delegations of teachers
 and students visited mainland universities, schools and related
organizations on Putonghua study.
</P>
<P>
"Language is the carrier of culture. By learning Putonghua
people can know more about the Chinese culture, history and
present condition, and this is where their enthusiasm comes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that learning Putonghua needs joint efforts by
people from various circles, such as publishers, journalists,
writers, as well as government officials.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Putonghua will become a core
subject in 1998 in both primary and secondary schools and will be
a Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination subject in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At present, 515 of the 860 primary and 214 of the 466 middle
schools have opened Putonghua courses, with some 2,000 teachers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Hong Kong Institute for Education has
decided to double the length of training courses for teachers from
60 hours to 120 hours. By 2000, over 25,000 Putonghua teachers
would have completed their training.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller today called on all the parties
concerned in northern Iraq to solve the problems through dialogue,
not through fighting.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-hour meeting on the latest developments in

Iraqi troops early Saturday launched attacks with heavy gunfire
on positions of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) around
Irbil, one of Kurdistan's main cities, in northern Iraq, and
reportedly captured the city by Saturday night.

Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and its rival PUK began fighting
in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Embarks on Strategies to Promote Palm Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is embarking on
three major strategies to promote palm oil and to turn the country
into a key player in the international cooking oil and fats
market.
</P>
<P>
The strategies are promoting palm oil, investing in oil palm
planting in third world tropical countries and investing in
refineries in consumer countries, Malaysian Primary Industries
Minister Lim Keng Yaik said here today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has all the resources to do these and it is important
for the country to sustain its present position in the palm oil
industry and to compete with other cooking oil in the world
market, he said after a social function here.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim, from 25 million tons of 16 cooking oil traded
in the world market, the palm oil shared 35 percent and out of
this Malaysia's share was 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia exports palm oil to over 100 countries with China and
Pakistan as the major importers.
</P>
<P>
The world consumption of palm oil is projected to increase to
105 million tons in the year 2005 from the present 85 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Lim said Malaysian investors had started large-scale investment
in oil palm planting in Indonesia and expected to do the same in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said he would lead a delegation in November to South
American countries such as Brazil, Ecuador to look for suitable
land for large-scale oil palm planting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also studying the possibility of starting large-
scale oil palm planting in tropical African countries like Burkina
Faso, Zaire, Nigeria and Ghana, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian investors, encouraged by the government, have set up
17 palm oil refineries in joint ventures in China and there are a
few such refineries in India and Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Malaysian players in the oil palm industry to form
consortiums as a way to explore large-scale palm oil planting
overseas.

<HEADLINE> HIV on the Rise Among Greek Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek women have become prone
to AIDS as more cases of HIV infections were found among them,
according to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,386 Greeks have been infected with HIV, the virus
which causes AIDS, Deputy Welfare Minister Theodoros Kotsonis told
reporters recently.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven HIV cases were reported between April and June
this year and they included a young boy who got infected by his
mother.
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality accounts for 56 percent of the known HIV
transmission while heterosexual intercourses account for 15
percent of the transmission, mostly to women.
</P>
<P>
But Kotsonis said that there is a slight drop in the number of
fully-blown AIDS patients each year, especially after 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Health Ministry has decided to offer AIDS patients
free of charge a new combination of drugs to help cure their
disease.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Forces to Withdraw from Northern Iraq: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi forces will be shortly
withdrawn from the northern Iraqi city of Irbil, Iraqi deputy
representative to the United Nations Saeed Hassan was quoted today
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, in a telephone interview with the American Cables News
Network, said that the decision to withdraw the Iraqi troops from
Irbil was taken because the Iraqi political leadership has not
intended to resume its local administration in the northern
self-rule area and not because of the U.S. threats.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military operation in northern Iraq was
nothing but a message to the Iranians and others to halt their
interference in the domestic affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The official Baghdad Television early this morning quoted an
Iraqi government statement as saying that Iraqi forces will
"return to their former positions very soon," but it gave no
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops Saturday shelled the positions of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) around Irbil, one of
Kurdistan's main cities, and reportedly had captured the city by
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the military attacks were launched against
the PUK, one of the Kurdish factions, "because it had been
cooperating recently with Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Iran of backing the PUK, but Tehran made no
official comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued shortly after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein chaired a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council,
the country's top decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton cut his election campaign to direct
a message to the Iraqi president over Irbil crisis, according to
the Voice of America (VOA).
</P>
<P>
the VOA quoted Clinton as saying that he has already placed the
American troops in the Middle East in full alert and
reinforcements will be sent to them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S. will do its best in cooperation
with other countries that share with it its concerns regarding the
situation in northern Iraq.

HARARE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's leading newspaper,
the Sunday Mail, today issued a comment demanding the end of the
two-week civil servants' strike.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said, for two weeks now Zimbabwe has been rocked
by its worst strike since independence as civil servants have
withdrawn their labour demanding salary increases of as much as
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strike which has brought government services to a limp is
threatening to go into its third week, and is having a serious
economic and political impact on the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some economists say the cost of the strike is in millions of
Zimbabwe Dollars and if it drags on for another week, the cost
could reach the billion Zimbabwe Dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper stressed, ''the strike that is currently
paralysing the government while inflicting heavy economic and
political consequences should be ended.'' enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Close to Reaching Understandings: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are close to reaching understandings on
moving forward the peace process after weeks of secret talks, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the new Israeli rightwing government and the
PNA have held secret meetings in the past weeks under the
mediation of Norwegian, U.N. and U.S. diplomats, the English-
language daily The Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The set of understandings, if concluded in written forms, will
constitute the first agreement between the two sides since the new
Israeli government took office in June, it said.
</P>
<P>
"There are talks between Israelis and Palestinians in
Tel Aviv. The two sides are in the advanced stages of obtaining
understandings which would break the deadlock and give the peace
process a real push," an official in Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Office was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The secret contacts started on August 13 and have been going on
due to the quiet and persistent efforts of Norwegian mediator and
U.N. Coordinator for the Territories Terje Larsen and his wife,
Norwegian diplomat Mona Juul.
</P>
<P>
Bringing together Israelis and Palestinians is not the first
for the couple, who were the facilitators of the original secret
Oslo talks in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Apart from hosting the talks with his wife in Tel Aviv, Larsen
has been shuttling between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and their top aides to discuss details and ease crises, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the secret meetings were Netanyahu's foreign policy
adviser Dore Gold and Arafat's top aide Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
The set of understandings include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- the Netanyahu government will increase the number of
Palestinian worders permitted to work in Israel from 37,000 to at
least 50,000;
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will permit the opening of a Palestinian airport in
Dahaniya in Gaza, with the understanding that Israel will retain
security inspection controls, as it does at the Rafah and Allenby
crossings;
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the PNA will meet to discuss mutual changes in
the Hebron redeployment agreement;
</P>
<P>
-- after the Hebron issue is resolved, Israel pledged to
negotiate further redeployments in the territories, which are
mandated by the Oslo II accord.
</P>
<P>
In addition, verbal understandings are also being worked
out. Specifically, the PNA will keep the institutions in Jerusalem
closed, and Israel will ensure that Arafat does not have trouble
in flying his helicopter between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have an interest in keeping Jerusalem a verbal
issue and not putting it in writing. The report said that
Arafat's willingness to close down several institutions in east
Jerusalem was because he expected Israel would agree to the
understandings listed above.
</P>
<P>
"Significant gaps remain, yet the Oslo train moves forward. It
seems like just as it looks that we are getting derailed, we get
back on track," Larsen was quoted as saying. He refused to
confirm the report about the secret talks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Larsen was joined in his efforts by U.S. coordinator
Dennis Ross and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk in the
last few days. Netanyahu originally rebuffed the U.S. involvement
in the secret contacts, fearing this would lead to pressure, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister Holds Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy is now holding talks here with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who arrived here earlier today, already held talks with
his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Levy's talks here, which came amid escalated tension between
Israel and the Palestinians, had been expected to focus on ways
to push forward the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The brief visit, the first since Levy took office in June, is
aimed at soothing the Arabs' anger over Israel's hardline policy
on Arab-Israeli peace talks, observers said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Levy is also expected to hold discussion
with the Egyptian leaders on a regional economic conference to be
held in Cairo between November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, who has acted as a mediator in Arab-Israeli peace
talks, has been frustrated over the stalemate of the peace
process. It has threatened to cancel the third Middle East and
North Africa Economic Summit if there is still no progress in the
peace march.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to Mubarak's
strong message on the same day, reassuring that Israeli-
Palestinian talks were advancing and the summit could be held as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
However, tension has mounted between the two sides since
Thursday when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called a four-hour
general strike in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in
protest against Israel's decision to expand Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and demolition of a Palestinian building in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa held talks on the stalled Middle East peace
process with his Israeli counterpart David Levy this morning in
this Mediterranean port city.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who arrived here earlier today for talks with Egyptian
leaders, is now holding talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, which came amid escalated tension
between Israel and the Palestinians, Levy would be very probably
trying to soothe the Arabs' anger over Israel's hardline policy
on the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
His talks are expected to focus on pushing forward the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy, on his first visit to Egypt since he took office in June,
is also expected to hold discussion with the Egyptian leaders on a
regional economic conference to be held in Cairo between November
12-14.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, frustrated over the stalemate of the peace process, has
threatened to cancel the third Middle East and North Africa
Economic Summit if there is still no progress in the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to Mubarak's
strong message on the same day, saying that Israeli-Palestinian
talks were advancing.
</P>
<P>
However, tension has mounted between the two sides since
Thursday when Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called a four-hour
general strike in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in
protest of Israel's decision to expand Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and demolition of a Palestinian building in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In another showdown with Israel, Arafat also Asked
Palestinians to come to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque Friday in
protest.
</P>
<P>
Arafat warned that Palestinians could be pushed toward another
bloody revolt if Israel does not move faster to make peace.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Garment Industry Increases Direct Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's garment industry,
spearhead of the nation's economy, is making efforts to raise its
competitiveness on the international market by more direct exports
and less sub-contracting with other countries, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The country is also trying to attract foreign investment to
update technology and equipment for more value-added products.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Vietnam's garment industry has registered a
remarkable annual growth rate of 15 to 20 percent, with its export
projected at 800 million U.S. dollars in 1996, about one-sixth of
Vietnam's total export.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of the garment export goes to the European
Union. Japan, Canada, Taiwan and South Korea are also important
markets.
</P>
<P>
However, still unable to produce raw materials for the
industry, Vietnam has to rely on imports from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Archives and Archival Management in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The 13th International
Congress on Archives (ICA) is scheduled to open in the Chinese
capital tomorrow, making China the first developing country
hosting the grand gathering of archivists around the world.
</P>
<P>
China's earliest archival repositories were established more
than 3,200 years ago, Chinese archivists say.
</P>
<P>
From a cellar in north China's Yellow River basin, Chinese
archaeologists unearthed some 20,000 pieces of animal bones and
tortoise shells, on which records in pictographic characters were
carved. The archaeologists regarded the cellar as the first
archives in China, and perhaps the earliest in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the following years, archives work was successively
undertaken by governments from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220) to
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), recording the process of political,
economic, cultural and social development of the country.
</P>
<P>
In ancient China, animal bones and tortoise shells, bronzes and
stone, bamboo and wooden slips, and fine silk had been used as
materials for writing before paper was invented. So there existed
archives on these materials.
</P>
<P>
An incomplete paper map of 179-150 B.C. found in 1986 in
Tianshui, northwest China's Gansu Province, is believed as one of
the earliest paper archives discovered so far in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the third century B.C., officials of the Han Dynasty built
the Shiqu Pavilion to keep the records of previous dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The Houhu Imperial Archives Storehouse of the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) was the biggest specialized archives in ancient China,
holding 1.79 million volumes of tax and corvee records, which
however no longer exist.
</P>
<P>
The only well-preserved ancient Chinese archives storehouse was
built in 1534 in Beijing, named Huangshicheng, which held imperial
family archives such as records, imperial edicts and genealogies.
</P>
<P>
It was after the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949 that the state began to build archival repositories and a
network of repositories has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Archives Bureau show that China has
3,574 archival repositories of all types at different levels,
covering a total floor space of more than three million square
meters, and holding 176 million files and volumes of archives.
</P>
<P>
The archival offices have a total of more than two million
linear meters of shelving.

<TEXT>
<P>
The archival repositories include some 2,980 state
comprehensive archives, 200 state specialized archives, 122
departmental archives, and 221 archival offices of enterprises and
51 of institutions.
</P>
<P>
Out of them, the Central Archives, the First Historical
Archives of China and the Second Historical Archives of China are
the top three archival repositories in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Central Archives keeps archives of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China and its agencies and institutions,
and archives of the executive and judicial agencies of the central
government of the PRC.
</P>
<P>
The First Historical Archives of China keeps the imperial
archives of the Ming and Qing dynasties and their government
agencies from 1638 to 1911.
</P>
<P>
The Second Historical Archives of China keeps the archives of
central executive agencies of the Republic of China form 1911 to
1949.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide network of archives offices has also been
formed. Most of the central and local Party and government
departments and army units, even party and government departments
in villages and townships and mass organizations, have put
documents on file and exercised management over archives.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has 13,552 archives offices, having a total of
more than 2.7 million linear meters of shelving and keeping more
than 90 million files of archives, as well as some 1.48 million
cassette tapes, videotapes and films.
</P>
<P>
China has about one million people involved in archives work,
the largest population of archivists in the world. Some four
million people visit archives offices to consult and utilize
archives every year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 70 kinds of special archives periodicals
have been set up, including Chinese Archives, the world's only
special newspaper on archives.
</P>
<P>
So far, technology of computer, microfilm and laser disc has
been widely introduced into China's archives work.
</P>
<P>
During the 6-day ICA congress, some 2,600 delegates from more
than 130 countries and regions will hold various activities around
the theme -- "Archives at the End of the Century - Reviewing the
Situation and Looking into the Future".
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the congress, the last one in this century,
will have marked and profound impacts on archives protection and
future development of global archives work.

WARSAW, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Solidarity organized
today a mammoth anti-government demonstration in Warsaw to mark
its 16th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Solidarity members and supporters took to
the streets, shouting slogans against the government of the

<P>
The action, commemorating the 1980 Gdansk accord by which the
Solidarity trade union was born, is believed to partly show
Solidarity's preparation for next year's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators also expressed discontent over President
Aleksander Kwasniewski's failure to fulfill promises of higher
pension for the old and more housing for the young.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are no reports of violence or interference from
the police.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Shrimp-Fishing Season Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 1 (Xinhua) -- About 160 Kuwaiti boats
set off to the sea to catch shrimps in the Gulf today, opening
the annual shrimp-fishing season in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
The concerned governmental department has put a lot of efforts
on monitoring shrimp-fishing, checking for violators and banning
unlicensed shrimp catching in Kuwait's territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Fishing was the main source of revenue in Kuwait before oil was
found and brought big amount of petro-dollars to its treasury.
However, because of overcatching, Kuwaiti shrimp resources have
rapidly reduced in recent years and the catching amount in 1995
was only 5,000 tons, 50 percent less than that in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 900 fishing boats of various kinds in
Kuwait with fishing licenses, some of the boat owners often
violate fishing regulations and rules and catch shrimps in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the owners of fishing vessels from fishing off the
shrimp-fishing season, the Fish Resources Department of the Public
Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources is empowered
to confiscate all nets on boats violating existing rules and
regulations and carry out punishments.
</P>
<P>
An official of the department said all legal steps were taken
to prevent exploitation of the dwindling shrimp stocks and
expressed hope that the employees at the Fish Resources Department
would cooperate with the authority in protecting this resource and
respecting all laws and decisions.
</P>
<P>
All the fishing boats which violate the fishing regulations
would be dealt with and their owners' fishing licenses would be
cancelled, he said, adding that those boat owners who violate the
regulations more than once would be referred to the concerned
authorities for punishment.
</P>
<P>
This shrimp-fishing season will last till February 15, 1997.

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Giant Learning to Adapt to Market Changes (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Then came a huge loss in 1994 that put the company's workers in
a state of shock, suddenly scratching their heads and wondering
what was going on. Liu Jie, who was appointed Angang's general
manager on the last day of 1994, summed up everyone's thoughts when
he said, "We have to think of why and find a way out."
</P>
<P>
In Liu's view, Angang faced the same problems that China's
state-owned firms all do, with products not meeting demand, high
costs brought on by inefficient management, overstaffing, and a
heavy debt burden.
</P>
<P>
So, topping Liu's agenda at the beginning of last year was the
idea of getting Angang's 400,000 workers to understand the notion
of market competition, instead of the old practice of waiting for
the government's steel production plan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 months, workers have been put through a series
of lectures and discussions to help them understand what China did
in its economic reform and how a market economy operates, making
them more aware of the law of survival of the fittest.
</P>
<P>
As a result, management style soon changed. "In the past, we
just turned out products in our own way and waited for clients to
come and buy. Now we closely follow the market and are ready to
make any product that the market wants and that we are able to
make," a member of the sales department explained.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 40 percent of Angang's 8.6 million tons of steel were
stockpiled and something that no one wanted. Since last year,
however, in stark contrast to that bleak period, the ratio of
sales to output has stayed at 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Giant Learning to Adapt to Market Changes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Running a business that has
400,000 employees is never easy, but it was especially bad at
China's biggest steel producer, state-owned Anshan Steel and Iron
Corporation (Angang), which suffered a loss two years ago for the
first time in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Angang, as it is well-known, managed, however, to extract
itself from its difficulties and is now headed for success. In
stark contrast to the more than 200 million yuan loss in 1994,
Angang registered a net profit of 330 million yuan last year, and
in the first half of this year, it was 176 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The change is not merely in figures. It shows that Angang is
no longer living under the shadow of a planned economy and has
thrown itself into market competition," Wu Xichun, Chinese
vice-minister of Metallurgical Industry, said in a recent
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Located in northeast China's Liaoning Province, Angang grew up
with decades of easy financial support from the central
government and has 20 billion yuan worth of assets and produces
8.6 million tons of steel annually.
</P>
<P>
As is common in a planned economy, Angang used to operate with
a state plan, ignoring market demand so completely that the staff
didn't need to bother about competition with other steel producers.
</P>
<P>
But times are changing. The nation began the painstaking
process of turning the old economic system into a market one in
the late 1970s and Angang responded slowly, while others, most
notably in the south, were quicker to respond to market rules and
left the giant stuck in the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
Angang also began a cost-control program a year ago. Workers
are encouraged to cut costs by a system of incentives and
penalties, related to lower per-unit costs of 1,450 products.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of the program, Angang's total costs
dropped by 365 million yuan, providing a better base for increased
profits.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister Wu regarded what Angang has done the result of
"just having a few lessons on reforms", and the positive changes
there clearly demonstrate that state-owned firms must play by the
market rules or they'll perish.
</P>
<P>
The general manager, Liu, is now concentrating on what to do
next. "We've done the easier things first and now we have some
hard nuts to crack," he commented.
</P>
<P>
One of the state sector's worst headaches is going to be
dealing with redundancy among employees. At Angang, overstaffing
puts average productivity as low as only about one-tenth of the
world's best companies.
</P>
<P>
Liu illustrated this by saying, "Cutting the payroll is
essential, but as a state entity we are not entitled to add to
unemployment, which could possibly increase social uncertainty."
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a staff reduction plan was worked out,
according to which Angang will gradually bring the number of
employees down, from the present 400,000, dramatically to 50,000
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
On carrying out the plan, Angang will shoulder the
responsibility for re-employing the 350,000 workers to be laid
off. In fact, Liu plans to set up a number of subsidiaries to
absorb the present staff members, and then let the subsidiaries
freely develop in the marketplace on their own.
</P>
<P>
This plan has already begun, in fact. Although the final effect
is yet to been seen, Liu says he has confidence in reaching his
goal fairly smoothly.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the same time, Angang is trying to deal with its huge debt
burden, another problem that most Chinese firms face.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Angang had a debt load of 13.3 billion
yuan, the bulk of which was owed to banks, because most state
financial support had dried up in the late 1980s and it had to
borrow for new projects. Its interest payments alone were 1.7
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
In response, Liu has decided to readjust the corporation's
investment policy to improve the balance sheet. Investment sources
will be mainly its own capital in the future, instead of bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
From now to the year 2000, Angang expects to complete a massive
technological upgrading program that will require 21 billion yuan
in investment. About 60 percent of that will come from
depreciation funds, with the depreciation rate to be increased.
</P>
<P>
The corporation will also take steps to improve financial
management to make capital utilization more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Members of Angang's finance department estimate that when the
upgrading program is completed, the corporation's debt-to-equity
ratio will go from the present 67 percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu is optimistic about Angang's competitiveness in the coming
years. "By the turn of the century, 60 percent of our key
equipment and technology will catch up with world's most advanced
and our product mix and quality will be more in line with market
demand," he said.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Israel Not Worried about Iraqi Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel is not worried about
any Iraqi military action in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq,
reported Israel Radio today, quoting security officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that there is no reason to be concerned
about (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's steps at a time when
developments in the Irbil region in northern Iraq are being
closely watched.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi army's capabilities are still severely limited, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, the U.S. has been updating
Israel on the developments in northern Iraq and promised to brief
Israel if a decision on taking a military action is made.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War, Israel criticized the U.S. for pressuring
Israel to refrain from retaliating against the Iraqi Scud missile
attacks. The U.S. argued that it would complicate the situation
if Israel joined the war.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops and tanks supporting a Kurdish faction captured
the city in Irbil from a rival Kurdish force Saturday and raised
the Iraqi flag there.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton responded shortly that he had
ordered U.S. troops in the Gulf on high alert and is reinforcing
them in reaction to the Iraqi attacks on Kurdish dissidents in
northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> 97 Killed in Rebel Attacks in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 31 (Xinhua) - A total of 97 people
were killed in attacks by two anti-government guerrilla
organizations -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
and the National Liberation Army (ELN) -- that began late Friday
and lasted into early today.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas raided police posts and government buildings in
11 provinces across the country overnight in the worst series of
attacks in recent memory, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
In the action, 50 soldiers were killed and 45 were missing or
feared captured by the FARC guerrillas late Friday on the Las
Delicias military post on the border between the southern
provinces of Caqueta and Putumayo, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Samper returned to the capital from northern
Colombia to meet with Defense Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra and
the high military command.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the violent banana-growing region of Antioquia,
Samper warned the guerrillas that his government would respond to
the attacks with "decision and energy".
</P>
<P>
However, Samper proposed a peace agreement with the rebels that
would respect international humanitarian law for civilians, and
particularly children, affected by the long-running civil war.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Chip Makers to Trim Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Chip manufacturers in Japan will
have to slim their workforce in the wake of falling prices of
computer chips, a business newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Oki Electric Industry Co. will shed 20 of its employees at
a memory factory and move them to a telecommunication plant by the
end of this month, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
The VLSI Technology K.K., a Japanese arm of the U.S. VLSI
Technology Inc., is reported to be considering putting off until
at least next year a plan to increase its workforce.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese subsidiary of the Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in
the United States will put on hold recruitment until the end of
the year while the Nippon Motorola Ltd., a Japanese unit of the
Motorola Inc. in the United States, has curtailed the number of
its contract workers or specialists.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the Motorola and National Semiconductor Corp. have
announced payroll cuts of 145 and 500 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Payroll-trimming among Japanese chip makers is largely limited
to fine-tuning for the time being, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farms Receives 37 Million US Dollars of WB Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An agricultural seed
commercialization project will soon kick off using 37 million US
dollars of World Bank loans, "China Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of a 100-million-US-dollar national seed
commercialization program started by the Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture in 14 provinces and regions, and the other 63 million
US dollar loans will be used in other agricultural sectors, said
Zeng Yuzhuang, the State Farm Bureau director under the Ministry
of Agriculture, the paper's Business Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said the project is the first of a series of
overseas-financed agricultural development projects by state farms
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996--2000), adding his
administration is considering borrowing from the Bank and Japan to
develop grain and agriculture-related service industries within
the state farm system, it added.
</P>
<P>
The country's 2,120 state farms, set up in remote areas more
than four decades ago with help from demobilized troops of the
People's Liberation Army and the educated young people, are
seeking overseas capital to vigorously update and upgrade their
productivity, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The state farms have introduced 2.7 billion US dollars in
overseas capital, mostly used in the farms' manufacturing and
commercial sectors." the director said, noting the farms also
serve as "a hot incentive" for overseas private investors who are
seeking Chinese partners to enter the huge market.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 joint ventures have been set up in the sector
so far involving a total overseas investment of 1.5 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
State farms play a pillar role in propping up Chinese
agriculture, since they produce 12 percent of the country's
cotton, 80 percent of the natural rubber and 10 percent of the
total grain purchased by the state on 4.6 percent of the country's
farming acreage.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the gross national product of the state farms
is expected to increase to 60 billion yuan (7.2 billion US
dollars) from 37 billion yuan (4.46 billion US dollars) last
year.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Recall 2000 Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua)-- The Ugandan government will
recall another 2,000 demobilised soldiers to fight the rebels of
the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the north.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, Presidential Adviser on Military and
Political Affairs in the North, was today quoted by the local
daily ''the New Vision'' as saying that he had in April this year
recalled about 5,000 ex-combatants who are now in the northern
district of Gulu fighting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Saleh revealed that the government troops highcommand, which
met here last Monday under chairmanship of Yoweri Museveni,
Commander-in-Chief of the Ugandan armed forces, agreed that the
northern operation be given top priority and full support to rout
out the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The high command formally gave Saleh powers to deal with the
offensive and freedom to devise ways and means of ending the
rebellion in the north, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh promised that he is spending three months from July to
September to reorganise his army before launching a massive
operation against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the current rebel strength is only between
500 and 700.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, though there has been mass troop
deployment, the rebel attacks and burning of houses are bound to
continue because the area where the rebels are acting is a vast
area and some places are inaccessible. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
open a Japan center early this month in the Russian Far East to
help the transition to a market economy there, an economic daily
said today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Foreign Ministry officials, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
said that the center will be set up in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, a
southern city on the island of Sakhalin as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan will dispatch experts on accounting, book-keeping and
corporate management to the center to give advice to local
businesses, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it added, the center will also help train
personnel from enterprises of other cities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Sakhalin center, Japan has already opened two other
similar centers in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, both in the
southeastern part of Russia's Far East.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new center represents a shift in
Japan's aid policy for the Russian Far East away from humanitarian
assistance, the paper said.

DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Classes and administrative
activities were not held as scheduled at the Dhaka university on
Saturday, as the strike by opposition groups of students continued
in the campus.
</P>

The university authorities closed the campus nine days ago,

</P>
<P>
Classes were scheduled to resume on Saturday by the

The JCD was protesting police brutality against its members and
demanding the release of its arrested workers.
</P>
<P>
The JCD instead held a demonstration and a rally on the campus
in support of their strike. JCD leaders reaffirmed their demand

<HEADLINE> China's Longest Railway Line Fully Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A passenger train left Beijing
West Railway Station this morning to embark on a
more-than-2,000-km trip to Shenzhen neighboring Hongkong, marking
the full operation of China's longest railway line linking Beijing
with Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, Chinese minister of Railways, announced that from
today on, the new 40-billion-yuan (4.819 billion US dollars)
railway project, which is China's third north-south rail trunk
line, is fully operated by railway bureaus of Beijing, Zhengzhou,
Jinan, Shanghai, Nanchang, and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
At present stage, there are five return passenger trains
running from Beijing to Shenzhen and vice versa, plus cargo trains
as many as 20 returns running in some of the sections along the
line.
</P>
<P>
The 2,553-kilometer line runs through nine municipalities and
provinces in the inland area before connecting with the railway
line in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the railway project, which is the largest in
terms of scale and investment and the longest in one-time length,
began in early 1993, and the track-laying was completed in
November last year.
</P>
<P>
The railway line is considered of strategic importance because
of its role in alleviating the pressure of north-south railway
traffic, in improving the national railway layout, in promoting
the economic development of the regions along the line, most of
them still economically-underdeveloped, and in enabling the
continued prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao,
according to railway officials.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that a passenger train is scheduled
to depart at around 16:15 today from Shenzhen to Beijing along the
new railway line.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the ceremony marking the full operation
of the project were senior Chinese officials including
vice-premier Zou Jiahua, and representatives from the Asian
Development Bank and Japan Overseas Economic Corporation Fund
which provided loans for the project.

SINGAPORE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The General Election of
Singapore might be called in the latter half of this month, Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong indicated last night, the Straits Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local National Day Dinner, Goh said journalists
had asked him if they could take leave in September. "I told them
it would be safe to go on leave in the first two weeks of
September," the Prime Minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Goh said he had told journalists that they could
go on leave in October, when asked when he would call the
election. The next election is due by April next year.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said last night that there would be just one key issue
in the coming general election -- the record of the Goh Chok Tong
government.
</P>
<P>
"We are fighting on what have been done for Singapore in the
last six years, and what we intend to do over the next five years,
and thereafter. That is the single most important issue: whether
you think we've done a good job for Singapore, and whether you
think our program for the next 10 years will be good for
Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
Given his six-year track record, he added, he expected to do
better than in the last election in 1991, when the ruling People's
Action Party won 61 percent of the votes.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Students from five Montevideo
schools rallied in front of the Secondary Education Council
building to show their disagreement with the occupation of their
schools by other students.
</P>
<P>
They delivered to education authorities a document stating
their right to education and demanding a plebiscite of all
students to disentangle the present conflictive situation in
public education.
</P>
<P>
Secondary school students have occupied since August 15 their
school buildings demanding a bigger slice of the government budget
for education, the immediate cessation of the education reform
being implemented on an experimental basis by the Central
Education Directive Council (CODICEN), and a national plebiscite
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Students who demonstrated today said that beyond individual
positions toward the education reform, the occupation of the
schools "hampers dialogue, and damages everybody, mainly the
students themselves."
</P>
<P>
They also proposed that CODICEN provides a hall for the
plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
CODICEN has exhorted the occupying students to leave and has
said there will not be any dialogue on the education reform if the
schools continue to stay at the school sites.
</P>
<P>
It made a last call Friday announcing that if the students do
not end the occupation it will give authorities green light to
proceed according to the law.
</P>
<P>
By midday today, all the occupied schools outside the capital
had been reportedly abandoned by occupying students, while most of
schools in the capital were still occupied.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Appeal Court to Rule on Priebke's Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The appeal court of Italy will rule
September 5 on whether it is legal for the authorities to continue
the detention of former SS officer Erich Priebke, said a state
attorney here today.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was found guilty for his role in the 1944 massacre of
335 Italian civilians in the Ardeatine Caves near Rome as a
reprisal for an Italian Resistance ambush of an SS column in the
middle of Rome in which 33 Germans were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Italian authorities extradited Priebke from Argentina last
November and detained him in Italy. But the Rome military
tribunal exonerated Priebke on August 1 and ordered his release,
causing an international storm against the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was detained again following an application by a German
court for his extradition to face the same charges in his own
country. His lawyers have since sought his release, saying his
continued detention was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Public Security Department argued today that
Priebke's current detention was lawful because the German branch
of Interpol requested on July 16, or two weeks before the military
tribunal's verdict, that the former Nazi officer be held.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Representatives Discuss Easing Tensions in Serb Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- International representatives
met in Tuzla today to discuss ways to ease tensions at the
Serb-held village of Mahala, an IFOR spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held between United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) staff, IFOR officers and Carl Bildt, the top
international civilian official for Bosnia, said Lieutenant
Colonel Max Marriner, of IFOR.
</P>
<P>
IFOR, or the NATO-led peace Implementation Force, prevented
over 75 Muslim men from entering Mahala, some 40 kilometers
southeast of Tuzla, earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The village, on the Serb side of a demilitarized zone, was the
place where the clash between armed Bosnian Serb police and Muslim
refugees took place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is calm," Marriner said about the latest
developments in the area.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further tensions, Bildt, who is in charge of civil
aspects of the Bosnian peace effort, met U.S. General William Nash
and United Nations police officers.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also went into Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale, outside
Sarajevo, talked with Momcilo Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb
parliamentary speaker and a presidential hopeful in the election
scheduled for September 14.
</P>
<P>
In a related development to assure safety for the upcoming
election, the U.S. troops with IFOR found eight loaded ammunition
magazines in the village, Marriner said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Gurkhas' Demand for Equal Pensions Downplayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali ex-servicemen's
association has downplayed the demands by a group of retired
British Gurkha soldiers for equal pensions as their British
counterparts, a newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Ex-Servicemen's Association (NESA) Saturday said that
the ex-Gurkhas' demands are "unreasonable" and "unjustifiable,"
and couldn't possibly be met as retired British servicemen's
pension levels are 10 times higher, the Katmandu Post said.
</P>
<P>
The NESA argued that if the demands are pressed too hard,
Britain may disband the brigade of Gurkhas in the British army,
which has already been downsized to 2,500 from 4,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Each year Nepal receives considerable remittance from the
British Gurkha soldiers, mostly recruited from poverty-stricken
villages in the country's northern hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
The ex-Gurkha soldiers here have been on a campaign to press
the British government to meet their four-point demands including
equal service pensions as their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
However, the British embassy here last month made it clear that
 retired Gurkhas are provided with fewer pensions than their
British counterparts in accordance with a 1947 tripartite treaty
signed by Britain, India and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A unit of Gurkha troops, a part of the then British Indian
army, was transferred to the British army in 1947 when India won
independence from British rule.

KIEV, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma

</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, the president shall be the

were already decided on but their names were temporarily held back

<HEADLINE> Tariff Cuts Implemented Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Tariff revenue has risen
markedly over the last four months without disrupting capital
inflow, indicating China's overhaul of trade policies on April 1
of this year went smoothly, Today's China Daily quoted a senior
customs official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The customs raked in 47.4 billion yuan (5.7 billion US dollars)
in import duties from January to July, up 27.4 percent from the
same period of last year, customs figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Real capital inflow during this period registered a
year-on-year increase of 20.2 percent to hit 19.8 billion US
dollars, according to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
The amount of duty income lost through tariff deduction or
exemption decreased since April, bringing an additional income of
around 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) so far this year.
</P>
<P>
"By 2000, customs duty income can rise to 130 billion yuan
(15.7 billion US dollars) provided that China levies tariffs on no
less than 70 percent of its imports conducted through general
trade," said the official, adding another 30 percent are expected
to be imports for large projects with special tariff exemption.
</P>
<P>
China cut its nominal tariff rates by around one-third to an
average 23 percent in the audacious April move. The cut was
implemented in tandem with a withdrawal of tariff-free treatment
for capital goods imports by overseas-funded companies.
</P>
<P>
To avoid upsetting overseas investors, China introduced grace
periods within which investors could continue to enjoy tariff-free
treatment for their capital goods imports: through the end of this
year for projects with a total investment of less than 30 million
US dollars each; or by the end of next year for projects with a total
investment of 30 million US dollars or more each.
</P>
<P>
"The deadlines are not meant to hurt but to hasten investors so
they can implement their projects promptly instead of dragging on
for dozens of years." said the official, adding it is not totally
impossible for the state to reconsider prolonging the grace
period in favor of a smooth transition.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Twenty bodies of the 141
victims of a Russian chartered jet crash in the Norwegian Arctic
were lifted out today by a Norwegian military aircraft to a
hospital for identification, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were transported earlier today by a helicopter from
the site of Thursday's crash on Spitsbergen island, north of the
Arctic Circle, to Longyearbyen airport, where they were placed in
a hangar.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were being taken to Norway's Tromsoe hospital, which
has special facilities for identifying them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 25 Norwegian and Russian experts arrived at the
scene of the crash to evacuate other bodies and search for the
crashed plane's second black box after the first one was
discovered in snow late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first black box which contains a recording of cockpit
transmissions should be taken to Moscow as soon as possible but
the work was being hampered by bad weather and cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The Tu-154 passenger plane was carrying mostly Russian and
Ukrainian miners and their families, among whom were 20 women and
six children, on their way to replace colleagues working in the
Svalbard archipelago, which includes Spitsbergen.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft ploughed into the mountainside when it was
preparing to land at nearby Longyearbyen airport and all 141
people on board, including 129 passengers and 12 crew, were
killed.

<HEADLINE> French Troops in Gulf on Alert for Iraqi Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The French troops based in the
Gulf region are on alert following the outbreak of fighting in
northern Iraq, the French defense ministry confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The 130 French troops stationed at the Dahran air base in Saudi
Arabia were "in the same situation as the forces of our allies" in
response to the Iraqi move, said a defense ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered U.S. forces
in the Gulf to be on high alert and be reinforced as Iraqi troops
had reportedly captured the small city of Irbil.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 Iraqi troops supporting the Kurdistan
Democratic Party reportedly entered Irbil.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the relatively much heavier U.S. military presence in
the Gulf, which includes air, ground and naval forces, the French
troops in the region have only five Mirage fighters.
</P>
<P>
The French defense ministry official noted that France "is part
of a multinational coalition." Therefore, he said, "all decisions
are the subject of consultations and are taken in common within
the coalition."
</P>
<P>
France has been a member of the coalition enforcing controls
over the Western-created "no fly" zone in northern Iraq in the
wake of Baghdad's defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the third member of the coalition, condemned the Iraqi
move in the area today.
</P>
<P>
The latest Iraqi military operation, believed to be the largest
since the Gulf War, was targeting the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
allegedly backed by the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called it a
"limited military operation" designed to defend "our sovereignty,
our people and their properties."

 "China Youth Daily"
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tourism with Local Features Flourishes In Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of visitors
are coming to north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
attracted by its unique prairie scenery and the folk customs of
different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, 154,461 overseas tourists
visited the region, up 6.62 percent over the same period of last
year. And the visitors contributed 48.31 million US dollars to the
region's revenues from tourism.
</P>
<P>
There are two major travel routes in Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The western route, with the regional capital of Hohhot as the
center, features the scenery on the prairies and deserts, sites of
historical interests, and the folk customs of the Mongolian people
in the central and western parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
Folk songs and dances, horse and camel riding, cross-country
trips on motor vehicles, and visits to the mausoleum of the great
Genghis Khan are the most popular tourist programs along the
western route.
</P>
<P>
The eastern route crosses grasslands as well as grassy
marshlands, and the inhabitation of ethnic groups such as the
Daur, Ewenki and Oroqen peoples.
</P>
<P>
Tours on snow-capped areas, expeditions into the desert, and
hunting tours in the vast forest are the specialties on the
eastern route.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Inner Mongolia has held a Nadam Fair Tourist Festival
and a trade fair each year, to attract more investment to the
region.

<HEADLINE> Zhengzhou Shop Auctions Off Goods In Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A department store in the
capital of central China's Henan Province has found a novel way of
getting rid of goods that have been in stock for a long time -
auction them.
</P>
<P>
At the first such auction held in the Zhengzhou Commercial
Building in August, 52 stocked items were auctioned off, earning
the store more than 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The auction started bidding for all goods at one yuan. The
majority were durable goods, such as TV sets, sound systems,
electric ovens, bicycles, and motorcycles. One customer, for
example, walked away with a vacuum cleaner for a bid of 500 yuan,
when the original retail price was 1,700 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The auction helped the store recoup more capital than it would
have with the traditional method of holding a sale, said a
marketing official with the store, and the auction helped both the
store and the customers find the most acceptable price for stocked
goods so that each party felt satisfied with the results.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said the store will hold more auctions for
stocked goods in future.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Presidential Candidate Denies Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A promising Nicaraguan
presidential candidate has denied earlier reports that he would
offer the command of the army to the son of former dictator
Anastasio Somoza Debayle if he could win the October election.
</P>
<P>
Arnoldo Aleman, the presidential candidate from the right-wing
Liberal Alliance, was quoted by the "El Nuevo Diario" newspaper as
saying that he did not meet with or make any offer to Anastasio
Somoza Portocarrero, the son of former President Anastasio Somoza
Debayle who ruled from 1974 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
Earlier press reports said Aleman, having a solid lead in
opinion polls over former president Daniel Ortega from the
left-wing Sandinista Front in the two-horse race for the
presidency, would appoint Somoza Portocarrero head of the army if
he were to win the October 20 election.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old candidate, former mayor of Managua, has risen
to the top of the polls largely on his record of sprucing up the
capital city during his term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
He quit as mayor last year to run for the president and was
nominated as the presidential candidate of the Liberal Alliance, a
union of four parties including the group of former president and
military chief Somoza.
</P>
<P>
He has consistently denied charges by the Sandinistas that he
had political and personal links to Somoza.

government condemns the Tamil rebels for their "terrorist
atrocities."

<P>
The two ministers discussed issues relating to the possibility
of a repatriation agreement between the two countries on rejected

<HEADLINE> China Speeds up Development of Health Food Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's health food industry
is expanding quickly, with over 3,000 specialized businesses
producing at least 3,000 different healthful items.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 specialists and doctors from the country's 22
provinces and autonomous regions gathered in Beijing recently to
discuss China's strategy for developing the health food industry
in the 21th century, according to a recent report of the "People's
Daily".
</P>
<P>
With the country's rapid progress in the development of health
food products over the past decade, problems have arisen that
hinder the successful growth of the industry, including an
increase of fake products and false advertising, and the naivete
of manufacturers and consumers in regard to the industry and its
goods, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of health food in the coming century is
expected to surpass that of medicine, the newspaper quoted
participants in the symposium as saying.
</P>
<P>
As a result, experts believe, the best strategy for China's
health food industry is to foster a contingent of research
personnel who can improve production structures, focusing on the
development of health food for senior citizens, women and children.
</P>
<P>
The plan also should make full use of the heritage of Chinese
medicine to produce health drinks. And a development fund should
be set up to promote basic research and to turn scientific
research projects into products.

MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) has rejected the peace agreement that will be
formally signed here tomorrow between the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, we will not accept the agreement as a final and
lasting solution to the Mindanao conflict," Gadzali Jaafar, the
MILF's vice chairman for political affairs, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the MILF, a breakaway group of the MNLF, has
automatically become the official representative of the Moro
people seeking genuine autonomy following the forging of the
agreement between the government and the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that the MILF would not cooperate with MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari.
</P>
<P>
The Christian majority in the main southern island of Mindanao
have also voiced their opposition to the peace agreement, which
was initialed by Philippine government and MNLF negotiators in
Jakarta on Friday. Some radical militants set off five explosions
in Zamboanga Del Sur province to protest against the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military and police forces in Mindanao have been
 placed on alert over the threats of violence by Christian and
Muslim opponents of the peace agreement. Extra troops were
deployed in the south to strengthen security measures.
</P>
<P>
The latest reactions from the Christians in Mindanao and other
rebel groups in the country have sent a message to the Philippine
government that there might be no instant peace in Mindanao even
after the final peace agreement is signed.

NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Michael Chang of the United
States advanced to the 4th round after winning a hard-fought
five-set thriller at the U.S. Open tennis championships on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Chang defeated fellow-American Vince Spadea
6-4, 5-7, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Chang's close call mirrored the harrowing experiences of two

Top-seeded defending champion Sampras had to go five draining
sets to beat stubborn Czech Jiri Novak on Friday. The day before,

Indian Leander Paes.
</P>
<P>
Very few players can hang as tough as Chang, who took a 16-2
summer hardcourt record into the Open.
</P>
<P>
Both players were obviously exhausted by the end of the three
hour 50 minute struggle.
</P>
<P>
Also joining Chang into the fourth round were 13th seed Thomas
Enqvist of Sweden and France's Arnaud Boetsch.
</P>
<P>
Enqvist advanced with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Pablo

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has set up a number of enterprise groups as part of its
effort to introduce a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sichuan Provincial Foreign Trade and Economic
Commission, 17 enterprise groups have set up more than 170 branch
companies, accumulating a total capital of 16 billion yuan (about
1.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newly established Sichuan Changjiang Machinery Group has
accumulated a total capital of one billion yuan (about 120 million
US dollars) after annexing three state-renowned enterprises,
including the Changjiang Crane Plant, the Changjiang Excavator
Plant and the Changjiang Hydraulic Piece Plant.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of enterprise groups began in early 1996, when
the Chuanxi Phosphorus Chemicals Corporation joined Sichuan
Chemical Industry Group.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Sichuan Copper and Nickel Co. Ltd., derived from
the Lala Copper Mine and Chengdu Electric Smeltery, was set up.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Lutian Chemicals Co. Ltd. and the Sichuan Natural
Gas Chemical Plant formed the country's largest chemical
fertilizer manufacturer, which has turned out to be China's major
ammonia and urea production base, with an annual capacity of
750,000 and 1.24 million tons, respectively.

<P>
The city's gross industrial output value rose by 15.5 percent
in the January-July period, but the gross profit dropped by 4.3
percent from the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the municipal government said that one-third
of the local industrial enterprises are losing money.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Jiang Yiren, who heads the city's industry, said
that it is imperative to urge unprofitable enterprises to develop
new products, open up markets and improve management.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that a series of measures will be taken to reach
this goal: 10 distribution companies for manufactured goods will
be formed, 100 projects will be launched, and 1,000 sales agencies
will be established across the country within the year.
</P>
<P>
These steps will raise the rate of local industrial products
sold abroad and in other parts of the country by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city has encouraged science research institutes to set up
technical centers in enterprise groups for the development of new
products, Jiang said. And the city plans to raise the ratio of new
products to 50 percent, and to push 80 percent of that amount onto
the market within the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the pace to annex bankrupt enterprises will
be stepped up, incompetent enterprise leaders will be replaced,
and the self-governing rights of enterprises will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that most of Shanghai's unprofitable enterprises are
scattered throughout the textile and light industrial fields. The
city's leading industries, including automobiles, modern
telecommunications, and fine chemicals, are flourishing.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, six major industries yielded 53.5
percent of the city's gross industrial output value and 63 percent
of the city's total industrial profit.

advantage to hammer minnows San Marino 6-0 in a World Cup soccer
qualifying match in Group 7 in Cardiff, Wales on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dean Saunders had mixture feelings after the match as he scored
twice but also missed a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Mark Hughes also netted twice in a one-sided match and Wales
had enough chances to have hit 10 and the only sour note for the
home team was that Ryan Giggs' yellow card, added to one from a
previous game, means he misses a far more important World Cup game
against the Netherlands slated for October 5.
</P>
<P>
Saunders opended the scoring only one minute 22 seconds into
the match while the second arrived in the 26th minute from a
corner by Mark Pembridge.
</P>
<P>
In the 34th minute it was 3-0 when Andy Melville powered
through to force the ball home with his left foot.
</P>
<P>
A minute later goalkeeper Stefano Muccioli saved a penalty from
Saunders after pulling the Nottingham Forest striker
down. Saunders hit the ball well but Muccioli dived to his left to
beat the ball away.
</P>
<P>
A minute before half time, Wales extended the lead to 4-0 while
the fifth came in the 54th minute.
</P>
<P>
Wales hit the bar twice and had a goal disallowed for offside
before Saunders made it 6-0 with a close range header.

<P>
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Four goals in the first 19 minutes
powered Ireland to a 5-0 World Cup qualifying victory over
Liechtenstein Saturday in Vaduz, Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
The big-margin victory in the World Cup Group 8 match helped
the Irish erase the memory of an embarrassing tie last year.
</P>
<P>
Liechtenstein stunned Ireland 14 months ago by holding them to
goalless draw in a European Championship qualifying game to
capture its first point in international competition.
</P>
<P>
This time the Irish were quick in the attack and dominated
throughout, leaving no room to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Andy Townsend fired the first in the fourth minute and Keith
O'Neill added the second three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 minutes had gone by when it was 3-0 through Ian Harte
while eight minutes later he scored again with a lob over
the goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
Ray Houghton rounded off the team's victory at the 61st minute.

OTTAWA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed
today when a fire broke out and burned down a senior citizens
residence in the city of Montreal.

<P>
Three other residents of Villa St-Genevieve remained
unaccounted for this evening, police sources were quoted as saying
by media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out shortly after noon, was believed to
have been started by an errant match dropped by a woman who
herself was in hospital with serious leg burns.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four of the 41 residents were evacuated and transferred
to another home, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The search for further victims was hampered after the roof of

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Iraqi Forces to Withdraw from Northern Iraq Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi forces will withdraw
from northern Iraq "very soon," the official Baghdad Television
reported in the small hours of this morning.
</P>
<P>
The television quoted a government statement as saying that
Iraqi forces will "return to their former positions very soon,"
but it gave no timetable.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops Saturday shelled the PUK positions around Irbil,
one of Kurdistan's main cities, and reportedly had captured the
city by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the military attacks were launched against
one of the Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK), "because it had been cooperating recently with Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Iran of backing the PUK, but Tehran made no
official comment on the charges.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued shortly after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein chaired a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council,
the country's top decision-making body.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force, Navy Ready for Deployment in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States, prepared
for any contingencies, has alerted its air and naval forces both
at home and abroad for possible deployment to the Middle East in
response to the Iraqi onslaught on a Kurdish faction in northern
Iraq, U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A fleet of about three dozens of Air Force fighter planes from
bases in Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina, plus four
B-52 bombers, were notified to be ready to move on short notice,
and some Navy ships also were told to be prepared to move closer
to the Arabian Peninsula, they said.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman said Clinton had ordered the Defense
Department to take "prudent planning steps" in case a later
decision is made to deploy extra air and naval power.
</P>
<P>
"We have done that prudent planning," he said. But orders had
not gone out to send the forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force was assembling an "air expeditionary force" of
30-40 fighter planes to deploy to the Middle East, either to
Jordan, Bahrain or Qatar. They include F-15Cs from Langley Air
Force Base, Virginia; F-15Es from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base,
North Carolina; and F-16s from Shaw Air Force Base, South
Carolina. And a few tanker refueling aircraft were ready to go
with them, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also notified members of a Marine Amphibious Ready
Group of seaborne troops to be ready in case called upon. One of
such groups of Marines already is afloat in the Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is already in the Persian
Gulf on routine duty with a fleet of fighters aboard. And the
carrier battle group led by the USS Enterprise, on a port visit in
Greece, was told to be ready to move out on short notice.
</P>
<P>
All these were arranged according to President Bill Clinton's
order, which said that the U.S. forces should be now "on high
alert."

<HEADLINE> Police Station in Kosovo Attacked by Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The police station at the
village of Klincina in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo was
attacked by ethnic Albanians early today, the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The police station, located on the highway linking Pec and
Pristina, the provincial capital, was targeted by several mortar
shells but caused no fatalities, it said.
</P>
<P>
This is the third bomb attack by ethnic Albanian terrorists in
the Pec district in one month, which has deeply disturbed the
citizens of Pec and surrounding places, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
This is also the third terrorist attack in Kosovo this week.
Earlier this week, a Serbian Interior Ministry official, Ejup
Bajgora, was killed by machinegun fire at the village of Donje
Ljupce near Podujevo. On the same day, a bomb attack was launched
on the police department at the village of Celopec near Pec, but
fortunately there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the 2 million
population in Kosovo, have been active for decades in a strong
separatist movement, whose leaders proclaimed a republic in the
province in an attempt to break away from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to join neighboring Albania.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Try Again to Enter Serb Village in Eastern Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A group of Muslims started
today to move towards the Serb village of Mahala near Zvornik in
eastern Bosnia, where a group of Muslims had clashed with local
Serbs two days ago.
</P>
<P>
NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) troops in Bosnia are
closely monitoring the movement of the 75-strong group in order to
prevent a similar incident, according to the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a group of Muslims, who went to Mahala to rebuild
their war-damaged houses, clashed with local Serbs and Serb police
when the latter asked for identity cards from them, causing the
worst violence since the Dayton agreement was signed last
December.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR troops had to intervene later and detained two scores
of Serb policemen. IFOR ground force commander Michael Walker has
accused both Muslims and Serbs of being armed in the incident.
</P>
<P>
United Nations police spokesman Alexander Ivanko said today in
Sarajevo that there was a Muslim government army officer in the
group which tried to cross the inter-ethnic border into Serb
territory.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko also said that IFOR troops had set up checkpoints on the
roads in and out of Mahala in order to identify those who arrive.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman in Sarajevo Max Marriner said that the movement
was seen "more as a provocation."
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanko, about 50 Muslims are being held for
identification check and the buildings in the village are being
searched for weapons.
</P>
<P>
About 30 Muslims who arrived in the village Friday had spent
the night in sleeping bags. A large number of IFOR troops, U.N.
police and European Union monitors together with helicopters,
tanks and armored personnel carriers are deplored in the village
and its vicinity.
</P>
<P>
"We're not there in a protection mode, we're there at the
moment to find out why, if any reason, these men have to go to
Mahala," Marriner said, adding that Bosnian Serb authorities had
promised not to interfere so as to avoid such incident as happened
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Military Observers Extend Mission in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council has resolved to keep its military observers in Liberia
for another three months, whose mandate in the war-torn country
should have been over today.
</P>
<P>
The council has also warned the country's warlords who have
frustrated the international community by breaking about a dozen
peace agreements in recent six years that its support for Liberia
is not indefinite.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously on Friday, the council
agreed with a proposal from Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to send 24 more observers immediately.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Observer Mission In Liberia (UNOMIL) has reduced its
military officers from 93 to 10 since renewed factional fighting
erupted in Monrovia, capital of Liberia on April 6.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the U.N.
secretary-general is also considering to deploy civilian
personnel in the fields of disarmament, elections, human rights,
public information and administration within the current
authorized strength of 160.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed support to the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG who is helping implement the
latest peace accord signed in the Nigerian capital of Abuja two
weeks ago. The peace agreement has set a timetable for
disarmament by the end of January next year and elections on May
30.
</P>
<P>
"It is only on the basis of honest implementation of the new
timetable that the US is able to support the secretary general's
call for increased deployment," said US envoy Karl Inderfurth,
quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of west African countries have also threatened
sanctions against individual faction leaders to ensure
compliance.
</P>
<P>
The council also condemned the faction leaders for recruiting
children as fighters and the looting of U.N. property. At least 489
vehicles have been stolen in Liberia, worth 8.2 million US
Dollars. Only 11 have so far been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war broke out in Liberia more than six years
ago, no fewer than 150,000 people have been killed and about
750,000 fled their homes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders US Troops in Gulf on High Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today ordered U.S. forces in the Gulf to be on high alert and be
reinforced as Iraqi troops had reportedly captured the city
of Irbil in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also ordered the National Security Council to meet to
review the situation and discuss moves against Iraq's "provocative
action" in the Western-created "no fly" zone.
</P>
<P>
Reports said three Iraqi tank divisions with more than 30,000
Iraqi troops supporting the Kurdistan Democratic Party had entered
Irbil, and flag was flying above what used to be the Kurdish
parliament building in Irbil.
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which is alleged to be backed
by Iran, said they were driven out of the small city by the
Iraqi troops with a massive tank-led offensive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a campaign rally in Troy, Tennessee, Clinton said,
"These developments ... cause me grave concern. I have placed our
forces in the region on high alert and they are now being
reinforced."
</P>
<P>
"Early this morning the military forces of Iraq overran the
city of Irbil which is in the portion of northern Iraq controlled
and populated by the Kurds. The situation there remains unclear.
There are reports of heavy fighting and firing in populated
areas," he told the rally.
</P>
<P>
"It is premature at this time, and I want to emphasize that,
highly premature to speculate on any response we might have," he
added.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry accompanying Clinton's
campaign tour told reporters that the president had called through
phone his National Security Adviser Anthony Lake to hold a meeting
this morning to review the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry and Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott attended the White House meeting. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher was returning to Washington today, two
days earlier, from a California vacation.
</P>
<P>
A Clinton Administration official described the Iraqi movements
as especially alarming and was a rare development.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen this kind of deployment since 1991 after the
Gulf War when Iraq first moved against the Kurds," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes in the Persian Gulf have stepped up air patrols
since Friday and the administration is considering sending
additional fighter planes into the region.
</P>
<P>
It was said the Air Force had notified members of an "air
expeditionary force" with 30-40 fighter planes to be prepared to
deploy to the Middle East if called on. The airmen would deploy
from U.S. bases to either Jordan, Bahrain or possibly Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraqi forces were
providing "limited" help to the Kurdistan Democratic Party, who
had asked Saddam to intervene to "thwart the Iranian threat."
</P>
<P>
He said this "limited military operation" is to defend "our
sovereignty, our people and their properties."
